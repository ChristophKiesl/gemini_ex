Overview
 
Integrity is a medical device company focused on the design, development and commercialization of non-invasive glucose monitoring devices for use by people with diabetes and pre-diabetics. Integrity Israel was founded in 2001 with a mission to develop, produce and market non-invasive glucose monitors for home use by diabetics. We have developed a non-invasive glucose monitor, the GlucoTrack® model DF-F glucose monitoring device, which is designed to help people with diabetes and pre-diabetics obtain glucose level readings without the pain, inconvenience, cost and difficulty of conventional (invasive) spot finger stick devices. The GlucoTrack® model DF-F utilizes a patented combination of ultrasound, electromagnetic and thermal technologies to obtain glucose measurements in less than one minute via a small sensor that is clipped onto one’s earlobe and connected to a small, handheld control and display unit, all without drawing blood or interstitial fluid.
 
In June 2013, we received initial CE Mark (marking the Company’s declaration that the product meets the requirements of the applicable European Union directives) approval for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F non-invasive glucose monitoring device from DEKRA Certification B.V., our European notified body (the “Notified Body”). This original approval required that the device be re-calibrated every 30 days, with each such re-calibration taking between 2.5 and 3 hours to complete. In March 2014, we received CE Mark approval for six months’ calibration validity of the same device. This approval eliminates the need for monthly re-calibrations, and enables the calibration process to be conducted only when the sensor is replaced, once every 6 months. We believe that this is a significant feature of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F. Receipt of the CE Mark allows us to market and sell the GlucoTrack® model DF-F glucose monitoring device in European Union (“EU”) member countries that have adopted the European Medical Device Directive (the “MDD”) without being subject to additional national regulations with regard to demonstration of performance and safety. However, although the MDD is applicable throughout the EU, in practice it does not ensure uniform regulation throughout the EU.  Accordingly, member countries may apply and enforce the MDD’s terms differently, and certain EU member countries may request or require performance and/or safety data in addition to the MDD’s requirements from time to time, on a case-by-case basis. The CE Mark also permits the sale in countries that have an MDD Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU.
 
On August 31, 2015, we received approval from the Notified Body for improvements to the GlucoTrack® model DF-F to simplify and shorten (from approximately 2.5 hours to approximately half an hour) the initial calibration process for the device. These improvements are intended to reduce the backlog created as purchasers of the device await calibration. In addition, we received approval from the Notified Body on the updated intended use for the device, which expands the intended user population to include not only Type 2 diabetics, but also people suffering from pre-diabetes conditions as well, which we believe represents a material expansion of the potential market for the device. In December 2015, we received approval from the Notified Body for further improvements to the GlucoTrack® model DF-F that increase the accuracy and efficacy of the device. On February 19, 2016, we received an extension of our ISO 13485:2003 certificate and Annex II certification from the EU.  The ISO 13485:2003 certification signifies that we have met the standards required for company-wide implementation of device quality management system(s).  The scope of the certification is design, development, manufacture and service of non-invasive glucose monitoring systems for home use.  Annex II also addresses quality control systems. The certification allows us to self-certify certain modifications and changes and simplifies some of the reporting to and review by the relevant Notified Body.  This can shorten the CE-mark review process of future GlucoTrack® model DF-F enhancements or revisions, including software updates and other improvements of the device that do not affect the intended use and/or safety performance. Without an Annex II certification, each new device enhancement or modified version would be subject to the full EU CE-mark review process.  The ISO 13485:2003 and Annex II certifications enable us to potentially reduce the time to market for product sales on new, enhanced or modified GlucoTrack® model DF-F devices.

The GlucoTrack® model DF-F has not yet been approved for commercial sale in the United States. On August 10, 2015, we submitted pre-submission documents to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in connection with our proposed future application for FDA approval of our U.S. clinical trial protocol.  The pre-submission documentation was submitted to the FDA in order to obtain the FDA’s guidance regarding the U.S. regulatory pathway for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, the proper approach to refining the trial protocol and preparing the pre-marketing application. On October 19, 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss the pre-submission documents, including the approach to and details of the clinical trial protocol for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F. On May 10, 2016, we submitted a pre-submission supplement (including clinical trial protocol) to the FDA which reflects the feedback received from the FDA at our October 2015 meeting. On July 18, 2016, we completed a teleconference with the FDA to further discuss our pre-submission supplement. At the end of this discussion, we received verbal confirmation from the FDA that clinical trials of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F constitute non-significant risk device studies, which allows the trials to proceed without an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. Such trials are assessed by the FDA and not considered to present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or the welfare of subjects. We have identified and are currently negotiating agreements with two diabetes and endocrinology institutions in the United States, as well as prominent endocrinologists to conduct the clinical trials as primary investigators. Subject to finalizing of these agreements and to raising adequate financing to do so, we expect to begin clinical trials in the United States in the first half of 2017.
 

We are continuing to work to improve certain features of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, such as further simplifying the calibration process and improving the accuracy of the device.  Clinical trials conducted recently in Germany by Pfutzner Science & Health Institute, GmbH, headed by Prof. Dr. Andreas Pfutzner, on subjects with Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetics, as well as at Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, demonstrated favorable results, which were presented on November 10, 2016, by the Company at the 16th annual Diabetes Technology Meeting (DTM), Bethesda, MD in an invited presentation.  Most notably, the presentation included data validating that GlucoTrack’s accuracy has increased significantly. Results from the trials show 99.7% of the study data points within the clinically accepted A and B zones of the Consensus Error Grid (Type 2), 99.3% of the study data points were within the clinically accepted A and B zones of the Clarke Error Grid, 17.0% Mean Absolute Relative Difference, and 12.9% Median Absolute Relative Difference. In addition, the German trial concluded that the data confirms the performance of the GlucoTrack® among its intended users, including pre-diabetic patients.
 

In addition, we are developing a wireless module (“WLM”) with embedded Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi technologies, which we expect will enable transmission of measurement data captured by the GlucoTrack® model DF-F to a cloud based server. We expect this module and the related applications, if successfully developed, to facilitate sharing, viewing and analysis of GlucoTrack® model DF-F glucose measurements and profile by clinicians and others.
 

Since receiving CE Mark approval for our GlucoTrack® model DF-F glucose monitoring device, we have expanded our primary focus to include, in addition to research and development activities, preparation for anticipated future mass-production and distribution of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in EU member countries and other countries that have an MDD Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU, as well as other countries which consider the CE Mark as a reference for their regulatory or registration requirements. We have entered into exclusive distribution agreements with more than 15 distributors, and we are continuing negotiations with distributors in additional territories. The effectiveness of these agreements, in many cases, is subject to the receipt of local regulatory approval or registration, if required, for the commencement of sales of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the subject territory.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will receive the required local regulatory approvals in any of the countries in which such approvals are required, and therefore we may never be permitted to commence commercial sales of our products in such territories. Additional discussions with other potential distributors are also in progress. Among other jurisdictions, we are in the process of seeking regulatory approval for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in China where we have a distribution agreement in place and are awaiting local regulatory approval.   We currently are not seeking regulatory approval in Japan.

On May 4, 2016 we received regulatory approval from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS, formerly KFDA) for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F.  In October 2016, we received the final approval from South Korea, which enables us to commence sales of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in South Korea. Following the official approval, our local distributor placed an initial order for 100 units of GlucoTrack® model DF-F, which were fully paid for and delivered during the fourth quarter of 2016. In South Korea, the GlucoTrack® device is sold with 2 personal ear-clips (“PECs”), so the consumer does not need to incur further expenses to use the device in the first year. This marketing model may be adopted by other distributors as well.
 

Based on input from our local distributors and regulatory consultants, we estimate that we could complete the local regulatory approval review process in China during 2017. However, we have been informed that the local regulatory body in China  (the CFDA) has now required that we conduct additional  trials  before they determine whether or not to approve the device to be marketed. Due to these developments, we now anticipate that the regulatory review process in China will take an additional 17 to 23 months, and potentially longer if the results of the additional trials are not satisfactory to the local regulatory body or such regulatory body imposes additional requirements for approval.
 
The territories covered by our signed distribution agreements currently represent a potential market opportunity of up to approximately 141 million diagnosed diabetics (inclusive of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients).  This represents approximately 34% of the potential worldwide market of approximately 414 million people, based on estimates included in the International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, 7th edition, 2015. Of these territories, the territories in which the GlucoTrack® model DF-F has been approved for sale currently represent a potential market opportunity of up to approximately 23 million diagnosed diabetics (inclusive of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients), or 5.6% of the potential worldwide market. While we do not have reliable statistics that bifurcate the market opportunity among Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, we believe that on average approximately 87% of all people suffering from diabetes have Type 2 diabetes. Apart from the diagnosed patients, approximately 192 million people are estimated to suffer from diabetes that have not yet been diagnosed.  Based on estimates included in the International Diabetes Federation’s (IDF) Diabetes Atlas, 7th edition, 2015, the market opportunity for undiagnosed diabetics is 71 million people in the territories covered by our signed distribution agreements, of which 11 million people are in the territories in which the GlucoTrack® model DF-F has been approved for sale. Based on the IDF Diabetes Atlas, 6th edition, 2013 the world prevalence of pre-diabetics was 6.92% of the worldwide population, while the prevalence of diagnosed people with diabetes was 8.35%.
 
On November 9, 2016, the Company added two additional independent directors, bringing the total number of directors serving on our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) to 7, 5 of whom are independent. Additionally, the Company has formed a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance committee, both consisting solely of independent directors.  The Company continues to consider expansion of the Board of Directors and the establishment of additional appropriate Board of Directors committees to support the Company.
 
We do not own commercial manufacturing facilities and do not intend to build commercial manufacturing facilities of our own in the foreseeable future. We currently utilize a third-party manufacturer in Israel to manufacture the GlucoTrack® model DF-F.  In July 2014, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Wistron Corp. (“Wistron”), a Taiwanese entity and the manufacturing arm of Acer Inc.  Pursuant to such agreement, Wistron has agreed to mass produce and service, on a non-exclusive basis, the GlucoTrack® model DF-F and any future products, if any, introduced by us. Pursuant to such agreement, Wistron has also agreed to provide full turn-key manufacturing services for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, including components procurement, unit assembly, device integration, testing, packaging and delivery to customers (distributors).  In November 2015, we sent a delegation to Wistron’s main production facility in Taiwan to, among other things, inspect the readiness of Wistron’s production line for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F.  Wistron has produced a small pilot batch and recently produced a second pilot batch of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F device. A GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) audit by the local regulatory authorities in Taiwan was conducted in September 2016 and successfully completed. The production line for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is now ready and we expect to receive an official clearance from the Taiwanese authorities shortly.  We intend to utilize the services of both Wistron and the Israeli third-party manufacturer to produce the GlucoTrack® model DF-F.

We have expanded our Advisory board to include renowned key opinion leaders, in order to support the Company’s global clinical, regulatory and commercialization efforts. The advisory board now comprises six experts: Prof. Dr. Lutz Heinemann (Chairman): CEO, Science & Co, Düsseldorf, Germany; Prof. Irl B. Hirsch: University of Washington, School of Medicine, WA, USA; Prof. Dr. Michael Heise: University of Applied Science of South-Westphalia, Iserlohn, Germany; Prof. Jan Bolinder: Professor of Clinical Diabetes Research at the Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Sweden; Prof. Katharine Barnard: Health Psychologist, Bournemouth University, Faculty of Health and Social Science, England; and Dr. Barry H. Ginsberg: Diabetes Consultant, DMTC, NJ, USA.
 
In support of the commercialization effort, we intend to conduct further post-market clinical trials, as well as publish scientific and clinical studies, case studies, and white papers. To that end, we have engaged with a leading clinic in Germany, Pfutzner Science & Health Institute, GmbH, headed by Prof. Dr. Andreas Pfutzner, to conduct additional clinical trials on subjects with Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetics. We are in negotiations with another site in Israel and anticipate adding additional sites in Europe.
 
As a result of the improvements to the device that were submitted for approval in the second half of 2015 and approved in August and December 2015, we deliberately postponed sales of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the second half of 2015.  We held an international distributors’ conference in October 2015 during which, we educated our international distributors about the improvements to the device and set the expectation to begin taking orders for the improved device in the first quarter of 2016.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, after introducing the improved version of GlucoTrack® model DF-F, we received orders totaling approximately $1.9 million that are contingent on the receipt of local regulatory approval to market the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in certain countries.  We delivered devices totaling $400,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 for which we have received full payment.  We cannot guarantee when the remaining orders in the amount of $1.5 million will be fulfilled (if at all), due to the pending local regulatory process, and we have not received any pre-payments for these orders.
 
As part of our commercialization activities, in September 2016, we had a booth at the EASD (European Association for Study of Diabetes) 52nd annual conference in Munich.
 

The Company is also seeking and is already engaged in discussions with potential strategic partners, to assist  in expanding the Company’s presence and penetration in various markets throughout the world. In connection with the foregoing, we have approached certain leading companies in the field of diabetes and glucose monitoring, as well as other relevant companies that may have an interest in expanding their fields of interest. We cannot guarantee that such activities will conclude in positive results to the Company, if any.
 
In December 2016, we had a poster at the 9th Annual World Congress on Prevention of Diabetes and its Complications (WCPD, Atlanta, GA). This Congress provided the Company with an opportunity to showcase GlucoTrack® model DF-F as a tool to fight diabetes and its complications, as well as using GlucoTrack® model DF-F as a tool to assist pre-diabetics.
 
In February 2017, the Company presented at the 10th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD 2017) in Paris, France. The Company presented key findings including (1) the latest generation GlucoTrack® algorithm, which compensates for the tissue-lagging effect relative to blood glucose changes post-meal intake, significantly improves GlucoTrack® accuracy at different post-prandial (post-meal) states, and equalizes accuracy for pre- and post-meal glucose readings; (2) GlucoTrack® clinical accuracy as measured by Consensus Error Grid (CEG) showed 100% of the pre-prandial readings in the A+B zones, and 98.2% of the post-prandial readings in the A+B zones; (3) GlucoTrack® Model DF-F demonstrates consistent glucose measurement repeatability between different GlucoTrack® devices and on each earlobe of the same subject; (4) the repeatability of different GlucoTrack® devices is similar at all tested glucose ranges and post-prandial time periods; and (5) the GlucoTrack® mean precision absolute relative difference (PARD) of 8.2% is equivalent or better than the independently reported PARD values of commercially available continuous glucose monitoring systems.

The Company is also seeking and in some discussions with potential strategic partners, to assist the Company in expanding its presence and penetration in various markets throughout the world. In connection with the foregoing, we have approached certain leading companies in the field of diabetes and glucose monitoring, as well as other relevant companies that may have an interest in expanding their fields of interest. We cannot guarantee that such activities will conclude in positive results to the Company, if any.
 
In addition to the improvements to the GlucoTrack® model DF-F described previously, we have also continued to work on additional incremental improvements to the device and the development of new devices and, subject to our raising sufficient funds to do so, intend to continue these efforts in 2017.
 
We have not yet generated material revenues from our operations and, as of December 31, 2016, have incurred an accumulated deficit of $35,604,176, stockholders’ deficit of $10,949,430 and negative operating cash flows. We currently have no material sources of recurring revenue and therefore are dependent upon external sources for financing our operations. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to continue our operations. As a result, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in May 2010. On July 15, 2010, we completed a reverse triangular merger with Integrity Israel and Integrity Acquisition Corp. Ltd., an Israeli corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, pursuant to which Integrity Acquisition Corp. Ltd. merged with and into Integrity Israel and all of the stockholders and option holders of Integrity Israel became entitled to receive shares and options in us in exchange for their shares and options in Integrity Israel (the “Reorganization”). Following the Reorganization, the former equity holders of Integrity Israel were entitled to the same proportional ownership in us as they had in Integrity Israel prior to the Reorganization. As a result of the Reorganization, Integrity Israel became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We operate primarily through Integrity Israel.
 
Our principal offices are located at 19 Ha'Yahalomim St., Ashdod, Israel 7760049 and our telephone number is 972-8-675-7878. Our website address is http://www.integrity-app.com; the reference to such website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and such information should not be considered part of this report.

Exchange of Series A Unit for Series B Units; Sale of Series C Units
 
As more fully described in Note 10 to the Company's financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on March 13, 2013, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Series A Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “Series A Unit Purchasers”) pursuant to which the Company issued to the Series A Unit Purchasers an aggregate of 6,300 Series A Units, at a price of $1,000 per unit, each consisting of (i) one share of Series A 5.0% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series A Preferred Stock”), convertible into shares of Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $5.80 per share, and (ii) a warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $6.96 per share, up to 100% of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Warrant” and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the “Series A Units”).
 
The issuance and sale of the Series A Units constituted the second and final closing of an offering under the terms of the Series A Purchase Agreement. On November 19, 2012, the Company completed the first closing of the offering (the “First Closing”), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 165,057 shares of Common Stock at a price of $7.00 per share to certain accredited investors (the “First Closing Purchasers”). As a result of the conversion of the offering from an offering of Common Stock to an offering of Series A Units, the Company agreed with Andrew Garrett, Inc., the placement agent for the offering (“AGI”), that, following the closing of the sale of the Series A Units, the Company would exchange the shares of Common Stock acquired by each First Closing Purchaser in the First Closing for such number of Series A Units equal to the aggregate purchase price paid by such First Closing Purchaser in the First Closing, divided by $1,000, in each case subject to the execution by the First Closing Purchasers of a consent to such modification. Pursuant to this agreement, on May 13, 2013, the Company cancelled 162,907 of the 165,057 shares of Common Stock issued to the First Closing Purchasers and issued to such First Closing Purchasers an aggregate of 1,140.35 Series A Units. Such Series A Units include Series A Preferred Stock convertible into an aggregate of 196,597 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $5.80 per share and Series A Warrants exercisable for 196,597 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.96 per share.

Between August and December 2014, the Company entered into a series of Securities Purchase Agreements (“Series B Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “Series B Unit Purchasers”) pursuant to which the Company issued to the Series B Unit Purchasers an aggregate of 8,500 Series B units (“Series B Units”), at a price of $1,000 per unit, each consisting of (i) one share of our Series B 5.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion price of $5.80 per share, (ii) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $5.80 per share, up to such number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series B Preferred Stock (each a “Series B-1 Warrant”) and (iii) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, up to such number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series B Preferred Stock (each a “Series B-2 Warrant” and, together with the Series B-1 Warrants, collectively, the “Series B Warrants”). The shares of Series B Preferred Stock included in the Series B Units are convertible into an aggregate of 1,465,578 shares of our common stock, and the Series B Warrants included in the Series B Units are exercisable for an aggregate of 2,931,156 shares of our common stock, in each case subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
 


Between April 2016 and March of 2017, we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $7.56 million (net of related cash expenses) from the issuance and sale in a private placement transaction, at a price of $1,000 per unit, of 8,792.80 Series C units (the “Series C Units”), each consisting of (i) one share of our newly designated Series C 5.5% Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock” and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the “Preferred Stock”), convertible into shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an initial conversion price of $4.50 per share, (ii) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $4.50 per share, up to such number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series C Preferred Stock (each a “Series C-1 Warrant”) and (iii) a five year warrant to purchase, at an exercise price of $7.75 per share, up to such number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Series C Preferred Stock (each a “Series C-2 Warrant” and, together with the Series C-1 Warrants, collectively, the “Series C Warrants”). The shares of Series C Preferred Stock included in the Series C Units are convertible into an aggregate of 1,953,984 shares of our common stock, and the Series C Warrants included in the Series C Units are exercisable for an aggregate of 3,907,968 shares of our common stock, in each case subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
 
As a result of the initial issuance and sale of the Series C Units, pursuant to the terms of the Series A Warrants, on April 8, 2016, the exercise price per share of the Series A Warrants decreased from $5.80 per share to $4.50 per share and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each of the Series A Warrants, in the aggregate, increased such that the aggregate exercise price payable thereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the exercise price, will be equal to the aggregate exercise price prior to such adjustment. Also as a result of the initial issuance and sale of the Series C Units, pursuant to the terms of the certificates of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, on April 8, 2016, the conversion price per share of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock decreased to $4.50 per share.
 
Based on the terms of the purchase agreements relating to the issuance and sale of the Series A Units and the Series B Units, respectively, so long as any initial purchaser of Series A Units or Series B Units, as applicable (each, a “Purchaser”) holds any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, respectively, if (i) the Company sells any shares of Common Stock or other securities convertible into, or rights to acquire, Common Stock and (ii) a Purchaser then holding Series A or Series B Preferred Stock or Warrants reasonably believes that any of the terms and conditions appurtenant to such issuance or sale are more favorable to the purchaser in such subsequent sale of securities than are the terms and conditions granted to such Purchaser, then the Purchaser will be permitted to require the Company to amend the terms of this transaction (only with respect to such Purchaser) so as to match the terms of the subsequent issuance (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms and provisions that are or may be less favorable to such Purchaser).

Pursuant to the Series A Purchase Agreement and Series B Purchase Agreement, the Company was required to and did notify the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock of the closing of the sale of the Series C Units, and following receipt thereof such holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock were entitled, pursuant to the “most favored nation” provisions contained in the Series A Purchase Agreement and Series B Purchase Agreement (as described above), to elect to amend the terms of their purchase of Series A Units and Series B Units to match the terms of the Series C Units. The Company was obligated to amend the terms of any Series A Units and Series B Units held by a Series A Purchaser or Series B Purchaser, respectively, who timely made such election and tendered its Series A Units or Series B Units for exchange.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the holders of approximately 6,931 Series A Units have elected, pursuant to the “most favored nation” provision in the Series A Purchase Agreement, to amend the terms of their Series A Units to match the terms of the Series B Units. Accordingly, the Company has exchanged 6,931 share of Series A Preferred Stock into 6,931 shares of Series B Stock and 1,440,880 Series A Warrants into 1,200,710 Series B-1 Warrants and 1,200,710 Series B-2 Warrants. Due to the differences in the contractual terms of each of the financial instruments exchanged management determined that the exchange constitutes an extinguishment of the existing instruments and an issuance of new financial instruments. As a result of the exchange elections, the Company recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 a non-cash loss on extinguishment of Series A Preferred Stock and Series A Warrants in the amount of $1,284,354, resulting from the differences between the fair market value estimate of the new Series B Units less the net book value of the exchanged Series A Preferred Stock and less the fair value of the exchanged Warrants with down-round protection. As of December 31, 2016, no holders of Series A Units or Series B Units have elected to amend the terms of their Series A or Series B Units, as applicable, to match the terms of the Series C Units.
 
During February 2016, the Company entered into an Advisory Agreement with AGI, pursuant to which the Company retained AGI on a non-exclusive basis to provide certain advisory services to the Company. As consideration for such services, the Company extended through December 31, 2019, the expiration date of 364,071 warrants issued to AGI and/or its designees in connection with the Company’s common stock offering completed in
 2010 and the Series A Unit offering completed in 2012. The Advisory Agreement had an initial term of six months
, subject to automatic renewal
 for additional 30 day terms unless terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.  In April 2016, the Company and AGI amended that Advisory Agreement to extend the term of the Advisory Agreement for an additional six months.  In consideration for such extension, the Company agreed to modify the terms of the 439,674 warrants issued to AGI and/or its designees in connection with the Series B Unit offering to include full-ratchet anti-dilution protection. As a result of the two agreements the Company recorded in its statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, a one-time charge in the amount of $211,077 representing the incremental fair market value adjustments in respect of the above modified warrants issued to the placement agent. Such incremental fair market value adjustments represent the increase in the fair value of the warrants resulting from the above modifications and were recorded against stockholders’ deficit. In addition, as a result of the inclusion of anti-dilution protection, the Company classified $341,662, representing the fair market value as of April 2016 of the above 439,674 warrants issued to AGI out of stockholders’ deficit and presented them as warrants with down round protection within long-term liabilities.
 
 
Pursuant to a placement agent agreement (the “Placement Agent Agreement”) with AGI, at the initial closing of the sale of the Series C Units, the Company paid AGI, as a commission, an amount equal to 6% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units, plus 4% of the aggregate sales price as a management fee plus a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 3% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units. At the end of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh closings of the sale of the Series C Units, the Company paid AGI, as a commission, an amount equal to 10% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units sold in such closing, plus a non-accountable expense allowance equal to 3% of the aggregate sales price of the Series C Units sold in such closing. In addition, pursuant to the Placement Agent Agreement, the Company is required to issue to AGI: (a) 5 year warrants to purchase up to 390,798 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share and (b) 5 year warrants to purchase up to 195,398 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $7.75 per share.

Market Opportunity
 
Diabetes
 
Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. Diabetes is caused by the body’s inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin. This inability prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be maintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. Normally, the pancreas provides control of blood glucose levels by secreting the hormone insulin to decrease blood glucose levels when concentrations are too high. In people with diabetes, blood glucose levels fluctuate between very high levels, a condition known as hyperglycemia, and very low levels, a condition known as hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia can lead to serious long-term complications, such as blindness, kidney disease, nervous system disease, amputations, stroke and cardiovascular disease. Hypoglycemia can lead to confusion, loss of consciousness or death.
 
Diabetes is typically classified into two major groups: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body’s inability to produce insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes must rely on frequent insulin injections in order to regulate and maintain blood glucose levels. Type 1 diabetes is frequently diagnosed during childhood or adolescence, although disease onset can occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes, the more common form of diabetes, is characterized by the body’s inability to either properly utilize insulin or produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity and race or ethnicity. Depending on the severity of Type 2 diabetes, individuals may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or insulin injections to regulate blood glucose levels.

        According to the Diabetes Atlas (Sixth Edition) published by the International Diabetes Federation in 2013, an estimated 382 million adults worldwide, between the ages of 20 and 79, or approximately 8.4% of the world’s adult population, were estimated to suffer from diabetes in 2013 (not including those persons who suffer from impaired glucose tolerance or gestational diabetes, diabetic conditions first arising during pregnancy). The International Diabetes Federation estimates that this number will grow to approximately 592 million adults worldwide by 2035, a 55% increase from 2013. By 2035, the number of adults suffering from diabetes is estimated to increase by 109.1% in Africa, 96.2% in the Middle East and North Africa, 70.6% in Southeast Asia, 59.8% in South and Central America, 46.0% in the Western Pacific, 37.3% in North America and the Caribbean and 22.4% in Europe, over such regions’ respective 2013 levels.
 
Glucose Monitoring
 
Blood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, including the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness or impending illness, hormonal releases, variability in insulin absorption and changes in the effects of insulin in the body. Given the many factors that affect blood glucose levels, maintaining glucose within a normal range can be difficult. Diabetics generally manage their blood glucose levels by administering insulin or ingesting carbohydrates throughout the day to maintain blood glucose within normal ranges. Normal ranges in diabetics vary from person to person. In order to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges, diabetics must first measure their blood glucose levels so that they can make the proper therapeutic adjustments. As adjustments are made, additional blood glucose measurements may be necessary to gauge the individual’s response to the adjustments. More frequent testing of blood glucose levels provides patients with information that can be used to better understand and manage their diabetes. Testing of blood glucose levels is usually done before meals, after meals and before going to sleep. Diabetics who take insulin usually need to test more often than those who do not take insulin.
 
Clinical data supports the recommendation that frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is an important component of effective diabetes management. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, consisting of patients with Type 1 diabetes, and the 1998 UK Prospective Diabetes Study, consisting of patients with Type 2 diabetes, demonstrated that patients who intensely managed blood glucose levels delayed the onset and slowed the progression of diabetes-related complications. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a major component of intensive management was monitoring blood glucose levels at least four times per day using conventional spot finger stick blood glucose meters. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial demonstrated that intensive management reduced the risk of complications by 76% for eye disease, 60% for nerve disease and 50% for kidney disease. However, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial also found that intensive management led to a two- to three-fold increase in the frequency of hypoglycemic events. In the December 2005 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, the authors of a peer-reviewed study concluded that intensive diabetes therapy has long-term beneficial effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with Type 1 diabetes. The study showed that intensive diabetes therapy reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 42% and the risk of non-fatal heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular disease by 57%. However, despite evidence that intensive glucose management reduces the long-term complications associated with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association reported in a 2001 issue of its publication Diabetes Care that up to 67% of patients with diabetes fail to routinely monitor their glucose levels.
 

Spot finger stick devices are the most prevalent devices for blood glucose monitoring. These devices require users to insert a strip into a glucose meter, take a blood sample with a finger stick and place a drop of blood on a test strip that yields a single point in time blood glucose measurement. Despite continued developments in the field of blood glucose monitors, the routine measurement of glucose levels remains invasive, painful, inconvenient, difficult and costly. This has resulted in a sub-optimal and irregular measurement regimen for many diabetics.
 
 13
 

The FDA has approved continuous glucose monitoring system (“CGMS”) devices for blood glucose monitoring, when prescribed by a doctor. CGMS devices use sensors inserted under the skin to check glucose levels in interstitial fluid. The sensor stays in place for several days to a week and then must be replaced. A transmitter sends information about glucose levels via radio waves from the sensor to a pager-like wireless monitor. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, CGMS device users must check blood samples with a conventional glucose meter to calibrate the CGMS devices, and because currently approved CGMS devices are not as accurate as standard blood glucose meters, users should confirm glucose levels with a conventional glucose meter when making treatment decisions.
 
To our knowledge, only one device other than the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is currently approved for use in the EU for spot non-invasive blood glucose measurement. The FDA has previously approved a single non-invasive product for glucose trend analysis, the GlucoWatch®, so long as the device was used with conventional finger stick glucose monitoring devices. However, the device is no longer available commercially.
  We are not aware of any other devices that have been approved for use in either the United Stated or the EU for spot or continuous non-invasive blood glucose measurement.
 
We believe that a significant market opportunity exists for a reliable, inexpensive, non-invasive blood glucose measurement device and that such a device could greatly increase compliance with blood glucose measurement recommendations and help many diabetics better manage their disease, providing significant benefits to both patients and payors.
 
The Product
 
Our non-invasive blood glucose monitor, the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, utilizes a patented combination of ultrasound, electromagnetic and thermal technologies to obtain blood glucose measurements in less than one minute via a small sensor that is clipped onto one’s earlobe and connected to a handheld control and display unit. See Figure A, below.
Figure A
 


We believe that the GlucoTrack® model DF-F addresses the unmet need for more frequent monitoring of blood glucose among people with diabetes by overcoming two of the most significant challenges facing the market: 
· | pain, as the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is a truly non-inveasive device; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cost, as, despite the relatively high upfront cost of purchasing a GlucoTrack® model DF-F, we anticipate that the total cost of purchasing a device and purchasing replacement ear clips every six months (anticipated to be the only recurring cost, other than calibration costs, which are expected to be minimal) over the useful life of the device will be significantly lower than the cost of purchasing single use glucose sticks over that same period. See Figure B and the accompanying footnotes for a direct cost comparison of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F and conventional (invasive) spot finger stick devices. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We estimate that, over a five-year period, a GlucoTrack® model DF-F user could save an average of $6,405 when compared to the cost of a conventional invasive blood glucose monitoring system, while also taking advantage of the benefits of more frequent blood glucose testing. See Figure B, below.
 
Figure B
 

The direct cost comparison assumes (i) a single invasive measurement costs $1.00; (ii) the average user of an invasive device takes five measurements daily; (iii) the average retail price for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is $2,000 (including one personal ear-clip); and (iv) the personal ear-clip is replaced every six months at a cost of $100. The direct cost comparison excludes calibration costs, which are expected to be approximately $70, in total, over a five year period.
 

We believe that the overall costs associated with owning and using a GlucoTrack® model DF-F device are expected to be substantially lower than the cost of purchasing and using single use invasive devices over an extended period of time, as demonstrated in Figure B above. Nonetheless, the significant initial purchase price of a GlucoTrack® model DF-F might present a barrier to adoption of the GlucoTrack® system among some patients. In light of this fact, we are suggesting to distributors of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F that they consider offering end users financing and/or leasing options to lessen the initial financial burden associated with purchasing a GlucoTrack® model DF-F.  There can be no assurance that any such alternatives will be made available to end users. In addition, we intend to seek reimbursement approval for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F from third-party payors, including government payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States, in the event the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is approved for commercial sale in the United States), managed care organizations and other third-party payors. There can be no assurance that such third party-payors will provide reimbursement coverage for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F or, if so, whether such reimbursement coverage will be adequate. See “Risk Factors - If the GlucoTrack® model DF-F or our future product candidates, if any, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue or achieve or sustain profitability”.
 
Instead of directly measuring the glucose level of a user’s blood, as conventional spot finger stick devices do, the GlucoTrack® model DF-F uses a small, non-invasive sensor that is clipped onto a user’s earlobe to obtain certain body measurements using three technologies, which are then analyzed using a proprietary algorithm on a small, handheld control and display unit. Within one minute, the GlucoTrack® model DF-F will produce a blood glucose measurement that can be simultaneously audibly announced and displayed on the control unit, as well as recorded on internal flash memory. The two units of the device (main unit and personal ear-clip) are connected through a multi-wire flexible cable. When and if we develop a continuous measurement model, we plan for this connection to be wireless.

Since the GlucoTrack® model DF-F non-invasive measurement does not directly measure glucose levels in the blood, but rather measures a series of physiological characteristics that correlate with glucose levels, each patient must be calibrated by using a reference to a measurement obtained from an invasive device. Calibration consists of comparing an individual patient’s physiological measurements obtained using the GlucoTrack® model DF-F to measurements obtained from an invasive device under different circumstances over a defined period 30 minute period (3 measurements that require approximately 10 minutes each).
 
The three different technologies used by GlucoTrack® model DF-F, ultrasound, electromagnetic and thermal, simultaneously measure three independent criteria. These three measurements (criteria) are combined together by a unique (on line) algorithm to produce an acceptable measurement of a user’s blood glucose level.
 
The technologies operate as follows:
 
 
· | Ultrasound: The GlucoTrack® model DF-F uses ultrasound technology to measure the change of speed of sound through the earlobe, which is impacted by the glucose concentration in the capillary blood vessels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electromagnetic: The GlucoTrack® model DF-F’s electromagnetic technology uses a measurement of conductivity to measure the change in tissue impedance, which is a function of glucose concentration. The GlucoTrack® model DF-F’s electromagnetic technology analyzes criteria similar to those analyzed by conventional invasive devices, such as spot finger stick devices, but does so in a non-invasive manner. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Thermal: The GlucoTrack® model DF-F’s thermal technology uses a measurement of heat capacity characteristics of the tissue, which are influenced by glucose concentration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Non-invasive devices (under different stages of development) generally require frequent recalibration. For example, GlucoWatch, a single non-invasive product for glucose trend analysis that was previously approved for sale by the FDA, but which is no longer available commercially, required recalibrations approximately every 13 hours. The main reasons for calibration are that tissue parameters generally fluctuate in the area of the measurement, and are sensitive to the location of the sensor and the impact of potential disturbances. Disturbances are less frequent in the earlobes, where the GlucoTrack® model DF-F takes its measurements. Utilizing three channels simultaneously reduces the noise contribution in the measurement. In addition, the personal ear-clip contains sensors to help users attach the device to the proper part of the ear lobe.  The Notified Body for our CE Mark approval has determined that the initial calibration of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F device is valid for a period of six months, while to our knowledge, competing products require recalibration significantly much more frequently. Therefore, we expect the GlucoTrack® model DF-F will require only an initial calibration upon use of a new personal ear-clip (to be replaced every six months) and will not require further recalibration.  However, to date, in informal discussions with the FDA, the FDA has indicated that initially it would require recalibration of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F every month, but has not yet indicated what standards will be used for clearance.  Thus, if and when we receive FDA approval to market the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the United States, we may be required to provide for calibration on at least a monthly basis.  Recalibration of the device would be accomplished in the same manner as the initial calibration of the device, by comparing the readings obtained from the GlucoTrack® model DF-F against measurements obtained using an invasive device. We expect that the initial calibration and the first one or two recalibrations would be completed by experienced clinicians in a clinical setting, and all other recalibrations after the initial one or two recalibrations would be completed by the patient in a location of his or her choosing.

The GlucoTrack® model DF-F does not use any optical method (either Infra Red (IR) or Near Infra Red (NIR) technology), which we understand are being used by other developers of non-invasive blood glucose measurement devices. We believe that optical technologies are less reliable than the GlucoTrack® model DF-F’s combination of ultrasound, electromagnetic and thermal technologies due to inherent physiological limitations with optical technology. More specifically, optical technology is based on dispersion of a beam that is analyzed by spectrometric methods. As such devices are non-invasive, the beam passes through other components in the finger tip, such as skin, bone, muscle and fat tissue, which interfere with the measurements. Generally, most of these interferences have been overcome, but not the epidermis, primarily due to roughness, pigmentation and perspiration, which act like lenses in optical wavelengths.
 
Unlike conventional spot finger stick devices, which require single-use glucose test strips, the GlucoTrack® model DF-F requires no short-term disposables. We believe that the personal ear-clip that accompanies each GlucoTrack® model DF-F will need to be replaced only once every six months, although regulatory authorities may require that replacement occur more frequently. Since there is no additional cost or pain involved with each blood glucose measurement using the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, we believe that users of our device would be encouraged to take multiple blood glucose measurements per day, significantly increasing compliance with blood glucose measurement recommendations and helping diabetics better manage their disease. More frequent testing of blood glucose levels may provide a patient with information that can be used to determine optimal timing and dosage for corrective treatments such as insulin, and can also direct a patient to seek a clinical analysis or detailed testing and diagnosis. 
 

We intend to eventually develop a family of GlucoTrack® devices, including a device for nighttime usage (which would provide advance warnings of potential hypoglycemic episodes); a continuous measurement device; a driver alert device; a basic model to be used in poorer countries; a device for use in pediatric incubators; and a device for people with pre-diabetes. The current GlucoTrack® model DF-F, measures glucose levels at discrete times as desired by the user, known as spot measurement. We intend that next generation models of GlucoTrack® will include both spot and continuous measurements of glucose levels. We also intend to develop accessories for GlucoTrack®, and software applications for data processing and analysis. Certain models of the device will include a USB port to allow offline analysis of downloaded data. All of the above models will be derivative of the technologies currently used by the DF-F model. The modifications involve mostly engineering changes as opposed to development.
 
The GlucoTrack® model DF-F has received CE Mark approval, which allows us to market and sell the GlucoTrack® model DF-F glucose monitoring device in EU member countries that have adopted the MDD without being subject to additional national regulations with regard to demonstration of performance and safety. While the MDD is applicable throughout the EU, it requires only a minimum level of harmonization among member countries.  Accordingly, member countries may apply and enforce the MDD’s terms differently, and certain EU member countries may request or require performance and/or safety data additional to the MDD’s requirements from time to time, on a case-by-case basis.  Moreover, the MDD notwithstanding, because the regulatory regimes of the EU member countries are significantly diverse, it is difficult to predict future regulatory developments and risks. The GlucoTrack® model DF-F has not yet been cleared or approved for commercial sale in any other jurisdiction, including the United States.  See “Government Regulatory - Regulation of the Design, Manufacture and Distribution of Medical Devices” below for a discussion of the approval process for commercial sale in the United States. There can be no assurance that approval for commercial sale in any additional jurisdiction will be obtained on a timely basis or at all.

Manufacturing
 

We do not have commercial manufacturing facilities and do not intend to build commercial manufacturing facilities of our own in the foreseeable future. We currently utilize a third-party manufacturer in Israel to manufacture the GlucoTrack® model DF-F. In July 2014, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Wistron, the manufacturing arm of Acer Inc. Wistron has agreed to mass produce and service, on a non-exclusive basis, the GlucoTrack® model DF-F and any future products, if any, introduced by us. Pursuant to such agreement, Wistron has agreed to provide full turn-key manufacturing services for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, including components procurement, unit assembly, device integration, testing and packaging. Wistron has produced a small pilot batch and recently produced a second pilot batch of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F device. A GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) audit by the local regulatory authorities in Taiwan was conducted in September 2016 and successfully completed. The production line for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is now ready and we  received an official clearance from the Taiwanese authorities on January 11, 2017. We intend to utilize the services of both Wistron and the Israeli third-party manufacturer to produce the GlucoTrack® model DF-F. Our suppliers and their manufacturing facilities must comply with applicable regulations in the jurisdictions in which the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is being marketed (including ISO 13485 in the EU), current quality system regulations, which include current good manufacturing practices, and to the extent laboratory analysis is involved, current good laboratory practices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into agreements with qualified manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that, once contracted, such manufacturers will perform as expected.


Furthermore, the manufacturing of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F may be impacted by the Recast Directive on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, 2011/65/EU (“RoHS 2”). RoHS 2 is a new EU directive that came into force on July 22, 2014.  Like the MDD, RoHS 2, a recast of Directive 2002/95/EC that will cover electrical and electronic medical devices, is relevant in order to obtain CE Marking for certain products.  RoHS 2 compliance requires medical device manufacturers to:  draw up required technical documentation; conduct an internal control procedure in accordance with Module A of Annex II to Decision No. 768/2008/EC; prepare a Declaration of Conformity; and affix CE Marking to a finished product.  Although these requirements are similar to those of the MDD, RoHS 2 does not require a Notified Body assessment of compliance. However, if they are not compliant with RoHS 2, medical device manufacturers face the risk of being barred from selling medical devices in the EU after July 22, 2014.
 
Sales & Marketing
 
We have a limited number of dedicated sales and marketing personnel, as we intend to collaborate with third parties with established sales and marketing operations in the medical device industry (such as the distributors described below) to market and sell the GlucoTrack® model DF-F to point of sale end users and/or local distributors.
 
We have entered into agreements with distributors to sell the GlucoTrack® model DF-F device in more than 15 countries, subject in certain cases to the receipt of local regulatory approval or registration, if required, for the commencement of sales of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the subject territory. We cannot provide any assurance that we will receive the required local regulatory approvals in any of the countries in which such approvals are required, and therefore we may never be permitted to commence commercial sales of our products in such territories. Further discussions with other potential distributors are in different stages.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into additional distribution agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all or that, once contracted, our distributors will perform as expected.
 
Our distribution agreements entered into to date generally appoint the counterparty as the exclusive distributor of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in a stated territory.  Where local regulatory approval of the device is required, such appointment is generally conditioned upon receipt of such approval.  Our distributions agreements generally have a term of 18 months to three years, subject to renewal for additional terms, each of one year, unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term.  The distribution agreements provide minimum purchase quotas for the first contract year.  If a distributor fails to reach a specified quota, we may either terminate the distributor’s appointment upon 30 days prior written notice to the distributor, or, by notice to the distributor, provide that its distribution rights in the applicable territory shall no longer be exclusive.

Research & Development
 
We focus significant time and resources on research and development in connection with our efforts to continue to develop, improve and commercialize the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, as well as in connection with our development of other GlucoTrack® models. Our continuing research and development activities are primarily focused on software and algorithm improvements intended to improve the accuracy of the device, clinical trials to test the performance of the GlucoTrack® device when used by children and teenagers between the ages of six and 18, preparation for future FDA trials, testing new characteristics of the device, development of a new device in the GlucoTrack® family and seeking to streamline and continue to simplify the calibration process.  See “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Results of Operation” below for a discussion of the research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended 2014, 2015 and 2016.
Government Regulatory
 
Healthcare is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governments in the United States, and by similar authorities in other countries.  Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country. The laws and regulations affecting healthcare change regularly, thereby increasing the uncertainty and risk associated with any healthcare-related venture. The United States government has in the past considered, is currently considering and may in the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly and adversely affect reimbursement for healthcare products such as GlucoTrack® devices. These policies have included, and may in the future include: basing reimbursement policies and rates on clinical outcomes, the comparative effectiveness and costs of different treatment technologies and modalities; imposing price controls and taxes on medical device providers; and other measures. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in any jurisdiction in which the GlucoTrack® model DF-F or our future products, if any, may be cleared for sale could also have a negative impact on the demand for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F or our future products, if any. These include changes that may reduce reimbursement or payment rates for such products.
 
In the United States, the federal government regulates healthcare through various agencies, including but not limited to the following: (i) the FDA, which administers the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as well as other relevant laws; (ii) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iii) the Office of Inspector General, which enforces various laws aimed at curtailing fraudulent or abusive practices including, by way of example, the Anti-Kickback Law, the Anti-Physician Referral Law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, the Anti-Inducement Law, the Civil Money Penalty Law, and the laws that authorize the Office of Inspector General to exclude health care providers and others from participating in federal healthcare programs; and (iv) the Office of Civil Rights which administers the privacy and security aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). All of the aforementioned are agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. Healthcare is also provided or regulated, as the case may be, by the Department of Defense through its TriCare program, the Department of Veterans Affairs under, among other laws, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, the Public Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services under the Public Health Service Act, the Department of Justice through the Federal False Claims Act and various criminal statutes, and state governments under the Medicaid program and their internal laws regulating all healthcare activities.  If and when we receive FDA approval to market the GlucoTrack® DF-F in the United States, we will be subject to regulation by some or all of the foregoing agencies.
 
The applicable regulatory schemes in the EU are significantly more diverse than those in the United States and do not lend themselves to similar summary.  Although the CE Mark system and the MDD require a minimum level of harmonization in the EU, each EU member country may impose additional regulatory requirements.  Because there are numerous EU member countries with distinct legal systems, the scope of potential regulatory requirements in each of the EU countries (additional to the harmonized EU requirements) is difficult to summarize or predict.

Regulation of the Design, Manufacture and Distribution of Medical Devices
 
Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory clearances or approvals, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
 

Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.  These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others. As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing approval may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA approval (as described below). These differences may affect the efficiency and timeliness of international market introduction of GlucoTrack® model DF-F. For countries in the EU, medical devices must display a CE Mark before they may be imported or sold and must comply with the requirements of the MDD or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive. On June 4, 2013, we received our CE Mark approval for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F non-invasive glucose monitoring device from the Notified Body. Receipt of the CE Mark allows us to market and sell the GlucoTrack® model DF-F glucose monitoring device in EU member countries that have adopted the MDD without being subject to additional national regulations with regard to demonstration of performance and safety. However, although the MDD is applicable throughout the EU, in practice it does not ensure uniform regulation throughout the EU.  Rather, the MDD requires only a minimum level of harmonization in the EU.  Accordingly, member countries may apply and enforce the MDD’s terms differently, and certain EU member countries may request or require performance and/or safety data in addition to the MDD’s requirements from time to time, on a case-by-case basis. The CE Mark also permits the sale in countries that have an MDD Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU. On August 31, 2015, we received approval from the Notified Body for improvements to the GlucoTrack® model DF-F which simplify and shorten (from approximately 2.5 hours to approximately half an hour) the initial calibration process for the device. These improvements are intended to reduce the backlog created as purchasers of the device await calibration. In addition, we received approval from the Notified Body on the updated intended use for the device, which expands the intended user population to include not only Type 2 diabetics, but persons suffering from pre-diabetes conditions as well, which we believe represents a material expansion of the potential market for the device. In December 2015, we received approval from the Notified Body for further improvements to the GlucoTrack® model DF-F that increase the accuracy and efficacy of the device.  On February 19, 2016, we received an extension of our ISO 13485:2003 certificate and Annex II certification from the EU.  The ISO 13485:2003 certification signifies that we have met the standards required for company-wide implementation of device quality management system(s).  The scope of the certification is design, development, manufacture and service of non-invasive glucose monitoring systems for home use.  Annex II also addresses quality control systems. The certification allows us to self-certify certain modifications and changes and simplifies some of the reporting to and review by the relevant Notified Body.  This can shorten CE-mark review process of future GlucoTrack® model DF-F enhancements or revisions. Without an Annex II certification, each new device enhancement or modified version would be subject to the full EU CE-mark review process.  The ISO 13485:2003 and Annex II certifications enable us to potentially improve the time to market for product sales on new, enhanced or modified GlucoTrack® model DF-F devices.
 
On May 4, 2016 we received regulatory approval from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS, formerly KFDA) for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F.  In October 2016, we received the final approval from South Korea, which enables us to commence sales of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in South Korea. Following the official approval, our local distributor placed an initial order for 100 units of GlucoTrack® model DF-F, which were fully paid for and delivered during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 


We are in the process of seeking regulatory approval for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in China where we have a distribution agreement in place and are awaiting local regulatory approval.  We currently are not seeking regulatory approval in Japan.  We may also seek regulatory approval to market the GlucoTrack® devices in other foreign countries that do not rely on the CE Mark. To the extent that we seek to market our devices in other non-CE Mark countries in the future, we will be required to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements in each such country. Such regulatory requirements vary by country and may be onerous. As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy the regulatory requirements to sell our products in any such country.

In the United States, under Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a medical device is an article which, among other things, is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease in man or other animals. We believe that GlucoTrack® devices will be classified as medical devices and subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and its foreign counterparts. Devices are subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls. Class II devices are somewhat more complex and require greater scrutiny. Class III devices are new and frequently help sustain life.
 
In the United States, a company generally can obtain permission to distribute a new device in two ways – through a so-called “510(k)” premarket notification application or through a Section 515 premarket approval (“PMA”) application. The 510(k) submission applies to any device that is substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or to another device marketed after that date, but which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 device. These devices are either Class I or Class II devices. Under the 510(k) submission process, the FDA will issue an order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 28, 1976 or post-May 28, 1976 device that was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 device) and permitting commercial distribution of that device for its intended use. A 510(k) submission must provide information supporting its claim of substantial equivalence to the predicate device. The FDA permits certain low risk medical devices to be marketed without requiring the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification. In other instances, the FDA may require that a premarket notification not only be submitted, but also be accompanied by clinical data. If clinical data from human experiments are required to support the 510(k) submission, these data must be gathered in compliance with investigational device exemption regulations for investigations performed in the United States. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to section 510(k) should take about 90 days, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has concerns, and there is no guarantee that the FDA will clear the device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be lawfully distributed in the United States. 
If the FDA finds that the device subject to the premarket notification is substantially equivalent to a proper predicate device, then the FDA may “clear” that device for marketing. These devices are not “approved” by the FDA. There is no guarantee, however, that the FDA will deem the device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming, resource intensive and problematic PMA application process described below.
 
The more comprehensive PMA process applies to a new device that either is not substantially equivalent to a pre-May 28, 1976 product or is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices and can only be marketed following approval of a PMA application. For example, most implantable devices are subject to the PMA approval process. Two steps of FDA approval generally are required before a company can market a product in the U.S. that is subject to Section 515 PMA approval, as compared to a Section 510(k) clearance. First, a company must comply with investigational device exemption regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device; however those regulations permit a company to undertake a clinical study of a “non-significant risk” device without formal FDA approval. Prior express FDA approval is required if the device is a significant risk device. If there is any doubt as to whether a device is a “non-significant risk” device, companies normally seek prior approval from the FDA. Normally, clinical studies of new diagnostic products are conducted in tandem with a cleared or approved device and treatment decisions are based on the results from the existing diagnostic device. In such a setting, the FDA may consider the clinical trial as one not posing a significant risk. However, FDA action is always uncertain and dependent on the contours of the design of the clinical trial and the device and there is no assurance that the FDA would consider any proposed clinical trial as one posing a non-significant risk. Moreover, before undertaking any clinical trial, the company sponsoring the trial and the investigator conducting the trial are required by federal law to seek and obtain the approval of institutional review boards (“IRB”). An IRB weighs the risks and benefits of a proposed trial to ensure that the human subjects are not exposed to unnecessary risk and reviews the informed consent form to ensure that it meets federal requirements and accurately describes the risks and benefits, if any, of the clinical trial. IRB review occurs annually and annual re-approval is required. University medical centers as well as other entities maintain and operate IRB. Second, the FDA must review a company’s PMA, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the investigational device exemption. The FDA will approve the PMA if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The premarket approval process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process.

The GlucoTrack® model DF-F has not yet been approved for commercial sale in the United States. We believe that the GlucoTrack® model DF-F device will be classified as a Class III device that will be subject to the PMA process and require human clinical trials, although that may not be true with other products mentioned in this report.
 

On August 10, 2015, we submitted pre-submission documents to the FDA in connection with our proposed future application for FDA approval of our U.S. clinical trial protocol.  The pre-submission documentation was submitted to the FDA in order to obtain the FDA’s guidance regarding the U.S. regulatory pathway for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, the proper approach to refining the trial protocol, and preparing the pre-marketing application. On October 19, 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss the pre-submission documents, including the approach to and details of the clinical trial protocol for the GlucoTrack® Model DF-F. On May 10, 2016, we submitted a pre-submission supplement (including clinical trial protocol) to the FDA which modifies the pre-submission documentation to reflect the feedback received from the FDA at the meeting. On July 18, 2016, we completed a teleconference with the FDA to further discuss our pre-submission supplement. At the end of this discussion, we received verbal confirmation from the FDA that clinical trials of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F constitute non-significant risk device studies, which allows the trials to proceed without an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application. Such trials are assessed by the FDA and not considered to present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or the welfare of subjects. We have identified and are currently negotiating agreements with two US
 diabetes and endocrinology institutions in the United States, as well as prominent endocrinologists to conduct the clinical trials as Prime Investigators. Subject to finalization of these agreements and to raising adequate financing to do so, we expect to begin clinical trials in the United States in the first half of 2017.


Even when a clinical study has been approved or cleared by the FDA or a notified body or deemed approved, the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to the fact that the IRB at a given clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval which is required annually, or might suspend or terminate the study before the study has been completed. Also, the interim results of a study may not be satisfactory, in which case the sponsor may terminate or suspend the study on its own initiative or the FDA or a notified body may terminate or suspend the study. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated; there may be an insufficient number of patients who qualify for the study or who agree to participate in the study, or the investigator at the site may have priorities other than the study. Also, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure the FDA or a notified body that the product is safe and effective, a prerequisite for FDA approval of a PMA, or substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate device, a prerequisite for clearance under 510(k). Even if the FDA or a notified body approves or clears a device, it may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distributing the device may not be commercially feasible.

 
After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
 
A manufacturer of a device approved through the PMA process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affects its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its PMA and obtaining FDA approval for that supplement. In some instances, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. A manufacturer of a device cleared through a 510(k) submission must submit another premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source or manufacturing process. Any change in the intended uses of a PMA device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or cleared premarket notification. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.

The Affordable Care Act
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed the measure into law on March 23, 2010 and on March 30, 2010, the President signed into law a reconciliation bill that modifies certain provisions of the same. These two laws are jointly referred to as the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA.”
 
The principal aim of the legislation was to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who were uninsured. The law’s most far-reaching changes did not take effect until 2014, including a requirement that most Americans carry health insurance. The consequences of these significant coverage expansions on the sales of our products is still unknown and speculative at this point, although the ACA and certain state initiatives may compel private insurers to reduce coverage or reimbursement for various items and services, including medical devices of the type that we contemplate distributing.
 
This legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions. The most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer is required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. The tax applies to all medical devices, including our products and product candidates. The ACA also provides for increased enforcement of the fraud and abuse regulations previously mentioned.
 
In June, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld most of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. While federal regulatory agencies are moving forward with implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Congress and the President are attempting to pass legislation which would reverse the Affordable Care Act. Furthermore, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. Due to the unsettled nature of these reforms and the numerous steps required to implement them, we cannot predict to what extent (if at all) Congress and the President will succeed in limiting or reversing the Affordable Care Act, whether (and if so, what) additional health insurance reforms will be implemented at the federal or state level and/or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business. If the ACA or parts of it are repealed, it is unclear what programs, if any, Congress and the Trump Administration might enact and sign into law to replace the repealed portions of the ACA.
 
On August 2, 2011, President Obama and Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 to increase the federal government’s borrowing authority (the so-called “debt ceiling”) and reduce the federal government’s projected operating deficit. To implement this legislation, President Obama and members of Congress have proposed various spending cuts and tax reform initiatives, some of which could result in changes (including substantial reductions in funding) to Medicare, Medicaid or Medicare Advantage Plans. Under the agreement reached to allow the federal government to raise the debt ceiling in August 2011, a 12-member, bipartisan committee was given a deadline of November 23, 2011 to develop recommendations for reducing the federal budget deficit by a total of at least $1.2 trillion over ten years. However, the committee was not able to agree on a plan and, therefore, $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts, including a two-percent reduction in Medicare payments to dialysis facilities went into effect on January 1, 2013. In November 2013, CMS released a final rule that included a 12% cut for reimbursement of dialysis intravenous services.  While CMS created other offsets to make the first two years of the cut budget neutral, the adjustment itself in the bundle went down by 3.3% starting in January 2014, as part of a 3-4 year transition period to reach the 12% reduction. This means that Medicare dialysis rates  in an environment of increasing expenses. These measures and any future federal legislation relating to the debt ceiling or deficit reduction could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
There are ongoing discussions in the EU regarding amending the relevant regulatory framework.  It is difficult to predict what effect any amendments to the existing EU legislation may have.  Furthermore, each individual EU member country has the authority to amend its regulations and requirements additional to the minimum harmonization required by the MDD.  Because the EU member countries have diverse legal systems, it is difficult to predict what, if any, amendments may be implemented in each of the EU member countries and whether they may adversely affect us.

Reimbursement
 
We anticipate that sales volumes and prices of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F and any other products we commercialize will depend in large part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and workers’ compensation plans. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement for a product or therapy if they determine that the product was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Some third-party payors must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices before they will reimburse health care providers who use the products. Even though a new product may have been cleared for commercial distribution, it may find limited demand for the device until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payors.

 
Inasmuch as a percentage of the projected patient population that could potentially benefit from the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is elderly, Medicare would likely be a potential source of reimbursement in the United States. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and those suffering from Lou Gehrig’s Disease. In contrast, Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by United States federal and state governments and administered by each state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Medicare reimburses for medical devices in a variety of ways depending on where and how the device is used. However, Medicare only provides reimbursement if CMS determines that the device should be covered and that the use of the device is consistent with the coverage criteria. A coverage determination can be made at the local level by the Medicare administrative contractor (formerly called carriers and fiscal intermediaries) or a private contractor that processes and pays claims on behalf of CMS for the geographic area where the services were rendered, or at the national level by CMS. There are new statutory provisions intended to facilitate coverage determinations for new technologies under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 §731 and §942, but it is unclear how these new provisions will be implemented. Coverage presupposes that the device has been cleared or approved by the FDA and, further, that the coverage will be no broader than the approved intended uses of the device (i.e., the device’s label) as cleared or approved by the FDA, but coverage can be narrower. In that regard, a narrow Medicare coverage determination may undermine the commercial viability of a device.
 
Obtaining a coverage determination, whether local or national, is a time-consuming, expensive and highly uncertain proposition, especially for a new technology, and inconsistent local determinations are possible. On average, according to an industry report, Medicare coverage determinations for medical devices lag 15 months to five years or more behind FDA approval for respective devices. Moreover, Medicaid programs and private insurers are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. A key component in the reimbursement decision by most private insurers will be whether the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is reimbursed by virtue of a national coverage determination by CMS. We may negotiate contracted rates for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F with private insurance providers for the purchase of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F by their members pending a coverage determination by CMS. Our inability to obtain a favorable coverage determination for the GlucoTrack® model DF-F may adversely affect our ability to market the GlucoTrack® model DF-F and thus, the commercial viability of the product. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. Distributors expressly support the reimbursement process and, depending on the distribution agreement and geographic area, may assume responsibility for the process.
 
We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. Furthermore, deficit reduction and austerity measures in the United States and abroad may put further pressure on governments to limit coverage of, and reimbursement for, our products. There can be no assurance that third-party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Until reimbursement or insurance coverage is established, patients will have to bear the financial cost of GlucoTrack®. Third-party coverage may be particularly difficult to obtain while the GlucoTrack® model DF-F is not approved by the FDA as a replacement for existing single-point finger stick devices.
 
 24
 

Outside the United States, availability of reimbursement from third parties varies widely from country to country.  Within the EU, member countries’ medical reimbursement and healthcare coverage regulations and systems differ significantly.  It is, therefore, difficult to analyze and predict the prospect of consistent availability of adequate reimbursement in the various EU member countries.
 
Until a reimbursement code is achieved, in order to reduce out of pocket expenses for users and increase the number of devices sold, we are suggesting to distributors of the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the United States (and would anticipate suggesting to our distributors in the United States in the future if and when we receive FDA approval to market the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the United States) that they consider offering end users financing and/or leasing options to lessen the initial financial burden associated with purchasing a GlucoTrack® device.  There can be no assurance that any such alternatives will be made available to end users.
 
Anti-Fraud and Abuse Rule
 
There are extensive United States federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal and civil penalties that can materially affect us, if and when we receive FDA approval to market the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the United States. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following:
 
 
· | The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, as amended, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or with which they have certain other financial arrangements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The anti-inducement provisions of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act), which prohibit providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.), which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A of the Social Security Act), which authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment and/or denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs.
 
Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to increase patient protections, such as limiting the use and disclosure of patient specific health information. These state laws also impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.
 
 25
 

Similarly the EU and EU member countries may have similar fraud and abuse laws which would regulate our business in those jurisdictions.  However, given the diversity of legal systems within the EU, it is difficult to predict with specificity what anti-fraud legislation and regulations may be implemented and the penalties that they impose.
 
In the ordinary course of their business, medical device manufacturers and suppliers have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Recent federal and state legislation has greatly increased funding for investigations and enforcement actions, which have increased dramatically over the past several years. This trend is expected to continue. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private persons, known as qui tam relators, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients or nurses and other employees, as well as competitors. HIPAA, in addition to its privacy provisions, created a series of new healthcare-related crimes.

 
As federal and state budget pressures continue, federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation and enforcement efforts to root out waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs. A violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on a supplier’s liquidity and financial condition. An investigation into the use of a device by physicians may dissuade physicians from recommending that their patients use the device. This could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the GlucoTrack® model DF-F.
 
The Privacy Provisions of HIPAA
 
In the United States, HIPAA, among other things, protects the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information by limiting its use and disclosure. HIPAA directly regulates “covered entities,” such as healthcare providers, insurers and clearinghouses, and regulates “business associates,” with respect to the privacy of patients’ medical information. All entities that receive and process protected health information are required to adopt certain procedures to safeguard the security of that information. It is uncertain whether we would be deemed to be a covered entity under HIPAA and, owing to changes in the law, it is uncertain, based on our current business model, whether we would be a business associate. Nevertheless, we will likely be contractually required to physically safeguard the integrity and security of any patient information that we receive, store, create or transmit in the United States. If we fail to adhere to our contractual commitments, then our physician, hospital or insurance customers may be subject to civil monetary penalties, which could adversely affect our ability to market our devices. Changes in the law wrought by the provisions of Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, increase the duties of business associates and covered entities with respect to protected health information that thereby subject them to direct government regulation, increasing its compliance costs and exposure to civil monetary penalties and other government sanctions. While HITECH does not alter the definition of a business associate, it makes it more likely that covered entities with whom we are likely to do business in the United States, if and when we receive FDA approval to market the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in the United States, will require us to enter into business associate agreements.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that intellectual property is important to our business and to the medical device industry overall. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
 
We understand the importance of obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to file for and obtain patent protection of our principal products and procedures, to defend existing or future patents, to maintain trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.

           We have obtained issued patents covering our technologies related to the GlucoTrack® measurement process and our devices in the United States, and depending on the patent, in various countries in Europe, the Far East. the Pacific, Africa and Latin America.  Our patents expire between 2023 and 2031. Patent applications for these products are pending in several jurisdictions. We have also obtained a patent for our ear clip in a smaller number of jurisdictions and have applications pending for this product in a number of jurisdictions. We also have design patents granted and pending for various aspects of our device.
 
            We have obtained trademark registrations for GlucoTrack® in similar countries, and trademark applications for  GlucoTrack® are pending in two countries.  The trademark application for GlucoTrack® in Thailand is on appeal and pending as well. Trademark registrations were issued in eleven countries for "JUST CLIP IT" and additional applications are pending in three countries, including the United States. In addition, trademark registrations were issued in seven countries for "YOUR TRACK TO HEALTH", and additional applications are pending in the same three countries to register the trademark.  Trademark registrations have been issued in Israel to register "Integrity" and the Company's logo and are pending in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to register GlucoTrack in Chinese characters. 
 
              We believe that our patents and products do not and will not infringe patents or violate proprietary rights of others, although it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur. Litigation may be necessary to defend or enforce our patent rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Defense and enforcement of patent claims can be expensive and time consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable, and could result in the diversion of substantial resources and management time and attention from our other activities. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liability to third parties, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, require us to alter our products or processes, or require that we cease altogether any related research and development activities or product sales.


Patent protection is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions and issues. The patent application and issuance process can be expected to take several years and entails considerable expense. There can be no assurance that patents will issue as a result of any applications or that any patents resulting from such applications or our existing patents will be sufficiently broad to afford protection against competitors with similar or competing technology. Patents that we obtain may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or the rights granted under such patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages.

Competition
 
The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. Four companies, Roche Disetronic, a division of Roche Diagnostics; LifeScan, Inc., a division of Johnson & Johnson; Abbott Laboratories; and Bayer Corporation, currently account for substantially all of the worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems. These competitors’ products use a meter and disposable test strips to test blood obtained by pricking the finger or, in some cases, the palm or forearm.
 
Within the last few years, CGMS devices have been introduced into the market and will compete with the GlucoTrack® model DF-F and our future devices, if any. Currently, three different brands have obtained FDA clearance to market, and are selling, CGMS devices in the U.S. and EU markets. These brands are sold by Medtronic plc., Abbott Laboratories (not available in the U.S.) and Dexcom, Inc.. CGMS devices are invasive devices, in which a needle is inserted under the skin (either in the abdomen or the upper arm) and measures interstitial fluid. Although we cannot predict what standards will be employed by applicable regulatory authorities as we seek FDA clearance, the results achieved by the GlucoTrack® model DF-F in our safety and performance clinical trial conducted in 2012 and 2013 were similar to the results obtained from the CGMS devices that have been introduced to the market, as of the time of their introduction.
 
Abbott FreeStyle Libre is a relatively new device which was introduced to the market during 2014 and is targeted for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. It comprises a disk-shaped glucose sensor that is inserted into the upper arm and must be replaced every two weeks. In order to receive a reading, the user scans the device over the sensor and receives an immediate reading.
 
In addition, other companies are developing non-invasive glucose testing devices and technologies that could compete with our devices. There are also a number of academic and other institutions involved in various phases of technology development regarding blood glucose monitoring devices. We believe that the majority of non-invasive glucose monitors in development require frequent calibrations (from a few hours to a few days, compared to the GlucoTrack® model DF-F, which has a demonstrated efficacy period of six months from the initial calibration). Among the companies developing non-invasive glucose testing devices is Echo Therapeutics, Inc. Other companies developing continuous measurement devices, based on minimally invasive methods, such as implants or subdermal needles include Medtronic, Inc., Abbot Laboratories and Dexcom, Inc.
 
Some of our competitors are either publicly traded or are divisions of publicly-traded companies, and they enjoy several competitive advantages, including:
 
 
· | significantly greater name recognition;

Some of our other competitors also enjoy these competitive advantages. As a result, we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products.
 
To our knowledge, a summary of potential competitors with non-invasive products in development is set forth below in Figure D.
