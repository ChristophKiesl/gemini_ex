Item 1. Description of Business
 
The business of the Company is primarily that of a holding company with subsidiaries. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, National Five Holding Ltd, holds a 95 percent share interest in Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd (“NSEL”). NSEL has been incorporated to pursue a manufacturing, marketing, sales and maintenance opportunity in the aviation industry and is in negotiations with a major aviation company.
 
Corporate History
 
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar Network Ltd., (NNL), had carried out defense, aerospace and homeland security contract manufacturing. NNL has been discontinued due to insufficient working capital, quality issues with suppliers and design changes made by the customer.
 
Our second wholly owned subsidiary, Northstar Technical Inc., (NTI), had been involved in underwater sonar sensors primarily related to the fishing industry. NTI has been discontinued due to several issues in the commercial fishing industry. The time taken for new technology developments using underwater communicating techniques was long. The timeframe for market introduction was also lengthy. Although NTI’s sonar system was initially a success in a changing industry, NTI could not keep up with the larger competitors’ products. The Company did not consummate the signing of a Letter of Intent to acquire a development stage company specializing in advanced sonar technologies and systems and was discontinued.
 
Homeland Security and Military Defense:
 The Company had expected that design and manufacture of homeland security and anti-terrorism systems would have grown rapidly as the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United States Navy had planned to ramp up efforts to protect ports and other onshore high value assets and ships. In partnership with a division of Lockheed Martin Corp, we responded to a Request for Quote by the USN and they gave us a high assessment rating. We sold several systems but the DHS took the USN’s budget meant to purchase our systems and used the funds for the war in Iraq. This also happened the following year and subsequently the USN cancelled the program.
NEW DIRECTION
 
The Company continued to expend considerable efforts during the past year in developing operational knowledge of a particular industrial single engine Turbo Prop airplane, conducting research into Supply Chain Management Systems applicable to this project, carrying out market research in different geographical areas, in conducting

research into the most efficient procedures to obtain the Type Certificate for the airplane and in developing the most cost effective ways to carry out production of the airplane as well as strategies to acquire systems and technologies.
 
Due the large capital requirements of the perspective new aerospace venture the Company is working with a strong partner to obtain the worldwide rights to a single engine Turbo Prop airplane with industrial applications. If successful, our partner company will manufacture and market the airplane internationally and provide Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services in close proximity to customers with Northstar holding a share interest of approximately 30% interest in the new company. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, National Five Holding Ltd, is a 95% shareholder of Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd (NSEL). NSEL holds the Company’s interests in this endeavor.
 
Marketing
 Due to financial restrictions the Company is not actively marketing itself at present.
 
Technology Protection
 The Company currently owns no proprietary technology requiring protection with respect to its activities. If the company acquires any proprietary technology, it will put appropriate protection measures in place.
Need for Government Approvals
 If the Company is successful in acquiring the rights to the aforementioned single engine airplane, there will be required government approvals applicable to our expected future activities.
 
The approvals would likely be for an in-country Type Certificate and other certificates, as required, in other countries where the airplane would be marketed. These approvals will put in place by the company building the airplanes and not Northstar Electronics.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations
 If successful with the acquisition of the rights to the single engine airplane, the Company through its partnership with a local manufacturing company intends to abide by the applicable regulations in each country where it intends to carry out marketing and sales. The costs of meeting the regulatory requirements can be high and the Company in conjunction with its manufacturing and sales partner will do it’s best to procure the funds required.
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 The Company incurred no costs or adverse effects in its compliance with any environmental laws.
 
PRODUCTION
 
The Company has experience in carrying out work requiring multiple subcontractors to perform specialized tasks. The ability to integrate the work of multiple components to create a complete system will be NSEL’s main area of business - system integration.

EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2020 the Company has no employees.
