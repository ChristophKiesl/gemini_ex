Item 1. | Business

Our Company
Avaya is a global leader in digital communications products, solutions and services for businesses of all sizes, delivering its technology predominantly through software and services. We enable organizations around the globe to succeed by creating intelligent communications experiences for our clients, their employees and their customers. Avaya builds innovative open, converged unified communications and collaboration ("UCC") and contact center ("CC") software solutions to enhance and simplify communications and collaboration in the cloud, on-premise or a hybrid of both. Our global, experienced team of professionals delivers award-winning services from initial planning and design, to seamless implementation and integration, to ongoing managed operations, optimization, training and support.
Businesses are built by the experiences they provide, and Avaya delivers millions of those experiences globally through its software and solutions every day. Avaya is shaping the future of businesses and workplaces, with innovation and partnerships that deliver tangible business results. Our cloud communications solutions and multi-cloud software ecosystem power tailored, intelligent, and effortless customer and employee experiences that enable our clients to effectively engage and interact with their customers.
Avaya shifted its entire comprehensive software portfolio to Avaya OneCloud, which offers significant capabilities across contact center (OneCloud CCaaS), unified communications and collaboration (OneCloud UCaaS), and communications platform as a service (OneCloud CPaaS). We believe the Avaya OneCloud open, composable platform approach uniquely positions us to address a customer’s needs in creating a Digital Workplace for their campus-based and remote employees through Unified Communications and Collaboration and the Customer Experience Center, our name for contact centers, helping clients deliver tangible business results.
Avaya offers a range of software sales and licensing models that can be deployed on-premise or via a public, private, or hybrid cloud. With our open, extensible development platform, customers and third parties can easily create custom applications and automated workflows for their unique needs, and integrate Avaya’s capabilities into the customer's existing infrastructure and business applications. Our solutions enable a seamless communications experience that adapts to how employees work, instead of changing how they work.
Avaya also offers one of the broadest portfolios of business devices in the industry, including handsets, video conferencing units and headsets to meet the needs of every type of worker across a customer’s organization and help our customers get the most out of their communications investments. Avaya IP-enabled handsets, multimedia devices and conferencing systems enhance collaboration and productivity, and position organizations to incorporate future technological advancements. 
Operating Segments
Our business has two operating segments: Products & Solutions and Services.
Products & Solutions
Products & Solutions encompasses our UCC and CC software platforms, applications and devices.
•Avaya OneCloud UCaaS solutions enable organizations to reimagine collaborative work environments and help companies increase employee productivity, improve customer service and reduce costs. With Avaya OneCloud UCaaS, organizations can provide their workers with a single app for all-channel calling, messaging, meetings and team collaboration with the same ease of use as existing consumer apps. Avaya embeds communications directly into the apps, browsers and devices employees use every day, giving them a more natural, efficient and flexible way to connect, engage, respond and share where and how they want. During fiscal 2021, we expanded our portfolio to include new cloud-based solutions, and we continued integrating Artificial Intelligence ("AI") to create enhanced user experience and improve performance. For additional information on Avaya OneCloud, see "—Avaya OneCloud Deployment Options and Capabilities."
•Avaya OneCloud CCaaS solutions: Avaya’s industry-leading digital contact center solutions enable clients to build a customized portfolio of applications to drive stronger customer engagement and higher customer lifetime value. Our reliable, secure and scalable communications solutions include voice, email, chat, social media, video, performance management and third-party integration that can improve customer service and help companies compete more effectively. Avaya delivers OneCloud CCaaS solutions for cloud deployment and, in fiscal 2021, we continued to aggressively integrate AI, machine learning and leading-edge cybersecurity capabilities into our portfolio, providing our clients a deeper understanding of their customers’ needs with a robust and secure platform.
•Avaya OneCloud CPaaS combines the cloud with our communications platforms, providing a development platform and the application programming interfaces that enable developers to easily integrate both UCC and CC 
communications capabilities directly into internal and customer-facing applications and workflows. Organizations can quickly deliver modular, composable applications ("apps") and experiences that meet ever-changing customer and operational needs. 
Services
Complementing our product and solutions portfolio is a global, award-winning services portfolio, delivered by Avaya and our extensive partner ecosystem. Our services portfolio, which includes solution upgrades and provides new technology through our Avaya OneCloud subscription offerings, consists of:
•Global Support Services provide offerings that help businesses protect their technology investments and address the risk of system outages. We help our customers gain a competitive edge through proactive problem prevention, rapid resolution and continual solution optimization. Global support services also provide software solutions delivered through a subscription model to provide our customers an improved user experience and solution enhancements. Most of our global support services revenue is recurring in nature. 
•Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services enable customers to take advantage of our technology via the cloud, on-premise, or a hybrid of both, depending on the solution and the needs of the customer. Most of our enterprise cloud and managed services revenue is recurring in nature and based on multi-year services contracts.
•Professional Services enable our customers to take full advantage of their IT and communications solution investments to drive measurable business results. Our experienced consultants and engineers partner with customers along each step of the solution lifecycle to deliver services that add value and drive business transformation. Most of our professional services revenue is non-recurring in nature.
With these comprehensive services, customers can leverage communications technology to help them maximize their business results. We help our customers use communications to minimize the risk of outages, drive employee productivity and deliver a differentiated customer experience.
Our services teams also help our customers transition at their desired pace to next-generation communications solutions. Customers can choose the level of support for their communications solutions best suited for their needs, which may include deployment, training, monitoring, solution management, optimization and more. Our systems and service teams' performance monitoring can quickly identify and address issues before they arise. Remote diagnostics and resolutions focus on fixing existing problems and avoiding potential issues in order to help our customers save time and reduce the risk of an outage.
Avaya OneCloud Deployment Options and Capabilities 
Cloud and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) models generally refer to the products and services that allow organizations to move from owning, managing and running solutions to paying only for the capabilities they need. Avaya OneCloud provides an option for customers to access all of Avaya's software and solutions and customize as they see fit.
Avaya OneCloud provides the full spectrum of deployment options, including via private, public and hybrid cloud, as well as on-premise. This enables organizations to deploy our solutions in the way that best serves their business requirements and complements their existing investments, while moving with the speed and agility they require. 
Avaya OneCloud, delivered as Private, Public, Hybrid or On-Premise
•Private cloud: Each organization has its own instance of the software, although the platform is shared across multiple organizations, and can leverage its existing technology infrastructure investments without having to operate them. In this model, the organization transitions from a commercial model to a usage model and engages Avaya or a business partner to operate its investments on their behalf. The customer receives a tailored solution using the latest software with standardized cloud contracts.
•Public cloud: Each organization is a tenant of a shared instance of the software on a shared platform.
•Hybrid cloud: In a hybrid deployment, customers are able to leverage private cloud features that are already performing to their specifications and then integrate newly developed capabilities from the broader public cloud portfolio.
•On-Premise: While a growing portion of our business is transitioning to our private, public and hybrid cloud-facing consumption models, there are customers that have business models and/or requirements that mandate a premise-based infrastructure and therefore we will continue to support such solutions.
Avaya’s solutions are addressing the convergence of private and public cloud deployments observed across the industry. Used in conjunction with our private cloud solution, a customer can use a public cloud to provide capability at the edge of their network in a cost effective manner. Avaya’s investments in data-driven intelligent automation mean that if an organization 
needs to deploy an advanced, integrated, value-focused solution via a private cloud but needs it deployed in just hours, Avaya can deliver such a solution on the requested timeline. The benefit to the organization is “always available” access to the latest capabilities and innovation, quickly and at scale.
Avaya OneCloud, delivered as Subscription
Subscription begins the customer’s journey to the cloud by changing the commercial model from an ownership model with an existing on-premise solution to a usage model with monthly or annual subscription payments. The customer only pays for the software and solutions that they need as opposed to buying an off-the-shelf solution that cannot be easily tailored to their needs, while providing access to the latest software.
Avaya OneCloud Migration
We believe our migration methodology differentiates us from many other cloud vendors in the market because of our range of services and ability to seamlessly migrate our customers to the cloud. We provide a range of cloud-facing deployment options best suited to a customer’s business and the capabilities to help our customers deploy these options. Our approach also provides flexible options based on standardized methodologies, a range of services, enterprise software expertise and tools to help organizations along every step of their journey to the cloud by reducing transition complexities and risks as they move from their current deployment to a cloud-based one.
With our comprehensive Avaya OneCloud portfolio and a long-term technology development roadmap in place, we are helping our customers build state-of-the-art digital workplaces and contact centers. Our customers can take advantage of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions at any stage in their journey, and leverage new capabilities and innovations from Avaya and its ever-expanding partner ecosystem by consuming these software capabilities from the cloud, over-the-top of their on-premise solutions.
Application Developer Products
Along with off-the-shelf integration with frequently used business applications across an organization, Avaya’s converged communications platform simplifies the embedding of Avaya OneCloud communications and collaboration capabilities into business applications, including customer relationship management and enterprise resources planning. Our platform enables customers and third parties to work with Avaya to create customized engagement applications and to meet the unique operating requirements of a customer with unified communications and contact center capabilities including voice, video, messaging, meetings and more. Avaya also offers a cloud-based execution and test environment for developing proof-of-concept applications.
The Avaya Client Software Development Kit ("SDK") provides a developer-friendly set of tools that enables the building of innovative user experiences for vertical or business specific applications. Any functionality Avaya uses in its own clients and applications is available to developers through the SDK. Developers can mix and match functionality from both our unified communications and contact center solutions.
Avaya has an extensive developer program, Avaya DevConnect, that enables third parties to support and extend the capabilities of Avaya solutions to address business challenges. Thousands of companies around the world are program members, including developers, system integrators, service providers and Avaya customers.
Cloud, Alliance Partner and Subscription (“CAPS”) Revenues 
We measure our success in transforming our business to the cloud and our ability to reduce our dependence on premise-based perpetual licensing models by analyzing the contribution of our “CAPS revenue” to total consolidated revenue. CAPS revenue refers to revenue from cloud based solutions, together with revenues from our Strategic Alliance Partnerships and Subscription revenue. Our CAPS revenue as a percentage of total consolidated revenue has grown over the past three fiscal years, representing 40%, 26% and 16% of total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Global Alliances
Avaya global alliances are strategically oriented technical and commercial relationships with key partners that we believe enhance both companies' go-to-market strategy. We have three primary types of global alliances: Global Service Provider alliances, Global Systems Integrator alliances and Ecosystem alliances.
•Global Service Provider alliances: Through these partnering arrangements with leading telecommunications service providers, we pursue sell-to and sell-through opportunities for Avaya solutions and services. These alliances are integral in selling and implementing our cloud-based services. We also see them as a principal route to market for our UCaaS and CCaaS solutions. During fiscal 2020, we entered a strategic partnership with RingCentral, Inc. (“RingCentral") and began deployment of Avaya Cloud Office, our OneCloud UCaaS solution the same year.
•Global Systems Integrator alliances: These refer to arrangements with systems integrator partners, as well as key channel partners with strong professional services and personalized integration capabilities who include Avaya solutions within broader digital transformation programs and end-to-end vertical solutions.
•Ecosystem alliances: These partnering arrangements are with industry leaders and leading technology companies. They feature deeper, R&D-led integrations and/or expanded go-to-market efforts, such as the DevConnect Select Product Program or the Avaya & Friends Program for international markets. During fiscal 2021, we expanded our partnership with Salesforce by developing Avaya OneCloud for Salesforce and offering it in Salesforce AppExchange, we worked with Google to develop AI based solutions for the contact center, and we worked with Microsoft to develop an Azure based contact center and offer it through the Azure MarketPlace. 
Channel Partners
Our channel partners serve our customers worldwide through our Avaya Edge business partner program. Through certifications, the Avaya Edge program positions Value Added Reseller partners to sell, implement and maintain our communications systems, applications and services. Avaya Edge offers clearly defined partner categories with financial, technical, sales and marketing benefits that grow with levels of certification and revenue contribution. We support partners in the program by providing our comprehensive Avaya OneCloud portfolio of solutions in addition to sales, marketing and technical support. Although the terms of individual channel partner agreements may deviate from our standard program terms, our standard program agreements for resellers generally provide for a term of one year, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms. Agreements may generally be terminated by either party for convenience upon 30-days' prior notice, and our standard program agreements for distributors may generally be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days prior notice. Certain of our contractual agreements with our largest distributors and resellers, however, permit termination of the relationship by either party for convenience upon prior notice of 180 days. Our partner agreements generally provide for responsibilities, conduct, order and delivery, pricing and payment, and include customary indemnification, warranty and other similar provisions. The Company's largest distributor, ScanSource Inc., is also its largest customer and represented 7% of the Company's total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2021. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-Our growth strategy depends in part on our reliance on our indirect sales channel" for additional information on the Company's reliance on its indirect sales channel.
Our Business Today
Our solutions address the needs of a diverse range of businesses, including large multinational enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses and government organizations. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries, including financial services, healthcare, hospitality, education, government, manufacturing, retail, transportation, energy, media and communications. We employ a flexible go-to-market strategy with direct or indirect presence in approximately 190 countries. As of September 30, 2021, we had more than 3,800 active channel partners and for fiscal 2021 our product revenue from indirect sales through our channel partners represented 68% of our total Products & Solutions segment revenue.
For fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we generated revenue of $2,973 million, $2,873 million and $2,887 million, of which 33%, 37% and 42% was generated by Products & Solutions and 67%, 63% and 58% by Services, respectively. Revenue by business area is presented in the following table for the periods indicated:

 | Fiscal years ended September 30,
(In millions) | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Products & Solutions: | | | | | 
Unified Communications and Collaboration | $ | 683 | | | $ | 710 | | $ | 863 
Contact Center | 309 | | | 363 | | | 359 
 | 992 | | | 1,073 | | | 1,222
Services: | | | | | 
Global Support Services | 1,401 | | | 1,238 | | | 1,086
Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services | 281 | | | 282 | | | 297 
Professional Services | 299 | | | 280 | | | 282 
 | 1,981 | | | 1,800 | | | 1,665
 | $ | 2,973 | | | $ | 2,873 | | $ | 2,887

Our software revenue as a percentage of total consolidated revenue has grown over the past three fiscal years, representing 64%, 61% and 52% of total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our software revenue aggregates revenue across our two reporting segments. Software revenue includes subscription, public and private cloud, 
perpetual licenses and related software maintenance revenue. On-premise license revenue is included in Product & Solutions, while subscription, cloud related software maintenance revenue are primarily included in Services. 
One of our key focuses is increasing our recurring revenue — revenue from products and services that are delivered pursuant to multi-period contracts, including recurring subscription-based software revenue, maintenance, global support services and enterprise cloud and managed services. Non-recurring revenue consists of hardware, non-recurring perpetual-based software and one-time professional services. Hardware predominantly consists of endpoints, which include phones, video conferencing equipment and headsets. Non-recurring software is predominantly comprised of perpetual licenses. One-time professional services include installation services, as well as project-based deployment, design and optimization services. 
During fiscal 2021, Avaya introduced Avaya OneCloud ARR (Annualized Recurring Revenue) as a key performance indicator, which provides a leading indicator into the software solutions driving our growth. This metric is similar to what our industry peers report and reflects only the recurring components of Avaya’s portfolio. Revenues reported as part of Avaya OneCloud ARR include revenues from: 
•Avaya OneCloud CCaaS
•Avaya OneCloud CPaaS
•Avaya OneCloud DaaS (Device as a Service)
•Avaya OneCloud Private Cloud
•Avaya OneCloud Subscription
•Avaya Spaces
•Recurring revenues generated from Avaya Cloud Office
Avaya OneCloud ARR does not include recurring revenues from Maintenance, Managed Services or Avaya Cloud Office one-time revenues.
In fiscal 2021, OneCloud ARR was $530 million, compared to $191 million reported for fiscal 2020. We believe the OneCloud ARR, combined with our remaining performance obligations, provides a view into our long-term revenue growth potential and trajectory. 
Trends Shaping Our Industry
We believe several key trends are shaping our industry, creating a substantial opportunity for Avaya and other market participants:
•The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the trend toward remote work and workforce mobility requirements as the need to work from home — or from anywhere — dramatically increased and highlighted the need for dynamic, cloud-based solutions that can be used anytime and anywhere. Our customers have realized the advantages of remote work and many are adopting or are considering adopting a permanent hybrid model that combines remote work with a return to the office. Avaya solutions are well positioned to enable this new future of work and collaboration.
•UCC, CC and CPaaS are converging to become part of an integrated services offering delivering next-generation communications capabilities across a host of devices and channels.
•Preference for cloud delivery of software applications and management of multiple and varied devices continues to grow, all of which must be handled with the security that business demands. 
•The Experience Economy continues to grow. The Experience Economy is based on the concept that experience is a key source of value — it is a differentiator that creates competitive advantage for products and services. As consumers embrace new technologies and devices in creative ways and at an accelerating pace, Avaya is continuing to invest in AI-powered solutions delivered through cloud and subscription models to create “Experiences that Matter” for customers, employees and agents. This increased adoption and deployment of AI is providing significant new opportunities for enhanced UCC and CC solutions that improve the customer experience and transform the Digital Workplace.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that these trends create significant market opportunity for the next-generation UCaaS, Collaboration, CCaaS and CPaaS solutions that Avaya has brought to the market in fiscal 2021. The limitations of traditional premise-based communications solutions and services and capital-intensive buying models present an opportunity for differentiated vendors to gain market share in the cloud. We believe that the total available market for these solutions includes spending on communications applications, and the business devices that improve the application experience, as well as spending on one-
time and recurring professional, enterprise cloud and managed services, and support services to implement, maintain and manage these solutions. 
We are expanding our business in several of these areas, primarily with cloud-facing and subscription-based consumption models. We are also growing in the customer segments that we serve, including large enterprises with more than 1,000 employees, as well as midmarket enterprises with between 50 and 250 agents in the contact center market and between 100 and 1,000 employees for customers using our communications and collaboration solutions. The growth opportunity in these markets comes from the need for enterprises to increase productivity and upgrade their unified communications and collaboration and contact center strategy to a more integrated approach to account for changing customer expectations and the accelerated work from home / work from anywhere trend, increased mobility, and the demand for seamless experiences across multiple communications channels. In response to these needs, we expect that aggregate total spending on UCC, CC, CPaaS, services and support, and enterprise cloud and managed services to grow, with the majority of growth coming from cloud services.
Although the decision makers for our solutions and services have traditionally been senior IT leadership, up to and including Chief Information Officers ("CIOs"), our research finds that now more of the buying decisions are being influenced by business units and the broader C-suite, including Chief Executive Officers (“CEOs”), Chief Marketing Officers (“CMOs”) and Chief Digital Officers ("CDOs"). They have become more involved as digital transformation has expanded beyond the data center and IT infrastructure to encompass lines of business operations and customer experiences. CEOs, CMOs and CDOs are recognizing growing customer and employee demand for better interactions across multiple channels of their choosing, and they see an opportunity to differentiate their companies and lines of business by providing their employees with an opportunity to deliver a superior customer experience. 
We believe that due to the increasing importance of technology as both an internal and external-facing presence of the enterprise, as well as the high stakes of data breaches and similar cyber-security events, CEOs are increasingly engaged in the decision-making process. CMOs and CDOs are gaining additional budget authority as they are tasked with managing customer experience and marketing activities using sophisticated communications technology and rich data. We believe that because of the shifts in decision-making roles, the focus of customer experience solutions should be to provide businesses with better ways to engage with end users securely across multiple platforms and channels, creating better customer experiences, and ultimately, higher revenues for the business. 
In our experience, decision makers have three critical priorities:
•Shift to cloud-based solutions: Companies today seek technology that helps them lower Total Cost of Ownership (“TCO”) and increase deployment speed and application agility, including a variety of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions. They are also shifting away from a complex, proprietary capital-intensive consumption model to one that is more flexible and efficient in gaining access to the latest technology.
•Leverage existing technology infrastructure while positioning for the future: The speed at which new technology enters the market is challenging companies to rapidly adopt and install new technology. We believe this pressure creates strong demand for scalable systems that do not require enterprise-wide overhauls of existing technology to implement newer solutions and technologies. Instead, it favors incremental, flexible, extensible technologies that are easy to adopt and compatible with existing infrastructures.
•Manage the reliable and secure integration of an increasing number and variety of devices and endpoints: Today, business users leverage laptops, smartphones and tablets just as often – if not more than – desk-based devices. The ability to communicate seamlessly and securely across devices, applications and endpoints must be managed as part of an integrated communications infrastructure.
Our Answer
We believe we have positioned Avaya as the leader in cloud-based Digital Workplace and Customer Experience Solutions by:
•Defining innovation in our core market segments by delivering powerful AI-enabled cloud communications solutions.
•Winning with global services capabilities that support customer cloud adoption and drive expansion.
•Activating, converting and transforming our installed base by providing a customer journey that enables them to effortlessly migrate to and consume Avaya cloud services.
In addition, Avaya intends to:
•Increase our Midmarket Capabilities and Market Share: We believe our market opportunity for the portion of the midmarket segment that Avaya serves is growing. We define the midmarket as firms with between 50 and 250 agents for CC and between 100 and 1,000 employees for UCC. Not only do we believe this segment is growing, but we also believe midmarket businesses are underserved and willing to invest in IT enhancements. We intend to continue to 
invest in our midmarket offerings and go-to-market resources to increase market share and meet the growing demands of this segment.
•Increase Sales to Existing Customers and Pursue New Customers: We have a significant opportunity to increase sales to our existing customers by offering new solutions from our Avaya OneCloud portfolio. Our market leadership, global scale and extensive customer interaction, including at the C-suite level, supports our Avaya OneCloud portfolio, creating a strong software platform from which to drive and shape the evolution of enterprise communications. We have strong credibility with our customers, which provides us with a competitive edge as our customers make the transition to the cloud. Additionally, our refreshed product and services portfolio increases the potential for acquiring new customers.
We are both HIPAA and PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliant as we believe the ability to service the healthcare and pharmaceuticals industries, as well as merchants that accept credit cards, significantly expands our potential customer base and total addressable market. These certifications allow for market penetration into what are otherwise restrictive and difficult markets.
•Invest in Sales and Distribution Capabilities: Our flexible go-to-market strategy consists of both a direct sales force and an indirect sales force through our alliances and channel partners, which allows us to reach customers across industries and around the globe. We believe our channel partner network is a valuable competitive differentiator based on our brand and long history of having a channel sales go-to-market motion. We intend to continue investing in our channel partners and sales forces to optimize their market focus and enter new vertical segments. We provide our channel partners, including master agents and sales agents, with training, marketing programs and technical support that helps to further differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors. These agents are our primary distribution channel for small to midmarket customers. Under our master agent program, small to midmarket sales agents connect prospective customers with our direct sales force which then handles the transaction from contracting and partnering with the customer to determine what services are appropriate to ultimately managing and billing the customer for the Avaya services provided. The master agent program provides an option that rounds out the available choices for customers, channel partners and sales agents to access Avaya’s industry-leading communications solutions.
We also leverage our sales and distribution channels to accelerate customer adoption of our cloud-based solutions and generate an increasing percentage of our revenue from our new high-value software products, video collaboration, midmarket offerings and user experience applications.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on the opportunities created by the market trends affecting our industry.
A Leading Position across our Primary Markets
With a full suite of UCaaS, CCaaS and CPaaS solutions offered under Avaya OneCloud and our expansive go-to-market capability, we are a global leader in business communications. We maintain a leading market share in worldwide contact center agents and are recognized by industry analysts as being among the leaders in unified communications and collaboration seats. Additionally, we believe we are a leading provider of private cloud and managed services and that our market leadership and incumbent position within our customer base provides us with a superior opportunity to cross-sell to existing customers and position ourselves to win over new customers. 
Our Open Standards Technology Supports Multi-vendor, Multi-platform Environments
Our open, standards-based technology is designed to accommodate customers with multi-vendor environments seeking to leverage existing investments. Providing enterprises with strong integration capabilities positions them to take advantage of new UCC and CC technology as it is introduced. Our software technology does not limit customers to a single vendor or add to the backlog of integration work. We also continue to invest in our developer ecosystem, Avaya DevConnect, which has grown to include approximately 120,000 members as of September 30, 2021. Avaya DevConnect, together with our Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs"), which are a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications and applications development environments, allow our customers to derive unique and additional value from our architecture.
Building on our Leading Service Capabilities for a Significant Recurring Revenue Stream
Avaya's services relationships have long been significant contributors to our large recurring revenue base and provide us with significant visibility into our customers' future collaboration needs. Our global support services and enterprise cloud and managed services are typically provided to customers through recurring contracts. These contracts generally have terms that range from one to five years.
In addition to insights into their ongoing operational needs, our professional services team engages in migration planning, security services, custom application integration and other consulting activities that position us to understand our customers’ business needs today and in the future.
•Global Support Services: Avaya is a leading provider of recurring support services for business communications solutions. Our worldwide services-delivery infrastructure and capabilities help customers address critical business communications needs from initial planning and design through implementation, maintenance and day-to-day operation, monitoring and solution management. With more than 3,800 trained and certified services professionals worldwide, we can help customers find and implement the right communications solutions. The launch of Avaya OneCloud Subscription is a further evolution of our global support services business and provides our customers with additional flexibility in how they consume our solutions. 
•We believe the Avaya support services team continues to be well-positioned for success due to the close collaboration between our R&D and service planning teams in advance of new product releases. We offer high levels of automation to onboard and manage a customer’s communications infrastructure, delivering faster, more effective deployments from proof of concept to production. This includes a robust communications automation platform with full event orchestration leveraging advanced AI functionality. As a pioneer of the omnichannel support experience in enterprise support, Avaya also provides customers the option to interact with our chatbots to access immediate support online. Customers can also connect with one of our experts via web chat, web talk or web video. When necessary, Avaya Services can also directly access our R&D teams to resolve customer issues. All combined, these capabilities enable Avaya to provide the highest-quality service for Avaya products.
•Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services: Avaya’s enterprise cloud solutions and managed services solutions focus on customer performance and growth, encompassing software releases, operating customer cloud, premise or hybrid-based communication systems and helping customers migrate to next-generation business communications environments. We believe that our deep understanding of application management supporting unified communications, collaboration and contact center solutions positions us to best manage and operate cloud-based communications systems for our customers.
•Professional Services: Avaya offers a broad portfolio of capabilities through its professional services, including implementation/enablement services, system optimization, innovation services, partner solution integration and custom applications development.
We believe our employees and consultants are among the best in our industry because they are trained and supported by the best in the industry. The high level of customer satisfaction ratings we receive for support transactions is a testament to the expertise of our people. Our dedicated professionals are focused on satisfying customer needs, driving a proactive and preventive agenda to help customers maintain optimum levels of service.
We continue to broaden the options for cloud-based service offerings, expanding our consulting services capabilities and upselling our existing customers to our cloud-based and managed services offerings. We are investing to provide additional options along the spectrum of support service offerings, constantly developing our tools and infrastructure to improve our service levels. An important element in Avaya’s cloud strategy is its continued investment and growth of the Avaya Customer Success Function which includes three main responsibilities: Adoption, Expansion and Renewal for all cloud-based commercial agreements.
•The Adoption responsibility centers on ensuring Avaya cloud customers are effectively onboarded onto the cloud solution and have the capabilities to begin consuming their Avaya entitlements.
•The Expansion responsibility centers on the Customer Success team working with Avaya customers during the term of the arrangement to determine where Avaya technology solutions could be of value throughout their organization. This could mean additional entitlements of the same solutions or the positioning of new Avaya capabilities and solutions. 
•Finally, the Renewal responsibility centers on ensuring that Avaya customers have fully consumed and adopted their entitlements and extend their commercial agreement with Avaya.
It is through Customer Success that Avaya intends to provide a consistent cloud journey for Avaya’s cloud customers.
Open Standards, Product Differentiation and Innovation
Avaya’s open architecture provides a competitive advantage for us as potential customers consider migrating to our solutions and services because we can integrate with incumbent competitor systems and provide a path for gradual transition, while immediately achieving overall cost savings and improved functionality.
Throughout fiscal 2021, we enhanced our Avaya OneCloud portfolio by rolling out new solutions to address growing demand for our UCaaS, CCaaS, CPaaS and Subscription offerings, as customers transition to cloud-based and subscription consumption models to support public, private and hybrid cloud or on-premise deployments. 
We expect to continue investing in innovation across the portfolio to bring further enhancements and breakthroughs to market, encouraging customers to continue to add innovative new capabilities to their systems. As we expand our cloud and mobility opportunities, we are also identifying new ways to leverage virtual desktop infrastructure to securely deliver business communications to users. We are developing AI solutions internally and with partners to help organizations transform customer experiences. We are deploying these disruptive solutions to drive incremental value for our customers, and their customers.
Research and Development ("R&D")
Avaya makes substantial investments in R&D to develop new systems, solutions and software in support of business communications, including, but not limited to, converged communications systems, communications applications, multimedia contact center innovations, collaboration tools, messaging applications, video, speech-enabled applications, business infrastructure and architecture, converged mobility systems, cloud offerings, web services, artificial intelligence, communications-enabled business processes and applications, and services for our customers. Over the past three fiscal years, we have invested approximately $650 million in R&D, including technology acquisitions.
We invested 23.0%, 19.3% and 16.7% in R&D as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, reflecting a consistent investment in R&D as a percentage of product revenue and evidencing our commitment to innovation. Our investments in fiscal 2021 focused on driving innovative cloud solutions across our portfolio and new releases of our UCC and CC solutions.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of patents important to our business and we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our R&D investments in new products and services across all areas of our business. As of September 30, 2021, we had more than 4,300 patents and pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. These patents and pending patent applications cover a wide range of products and services involving a variety of technologies. For the United States, patents terms may be 20 years from the date of the patent's filing, depending upon term adjustments made by the patent office. In addition, we hold numerous trademarks in the United States and in other countries. We also have licenses to intellectual property for the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
We obtain patent and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Historically, we have done so both organically, through commercial relationships, and in connection with acquisitions.
We manage our patent portfolio to maximize return on investment by selectively selling patents at market prices and cross-licensing with other parties when such sales or licensing are in best our interests. These monetization programs are conducted in a manner that helps to preserve Avaya’s freedom to operate and to help ensure that Avaya retains patents needed for defensive use.
From time to time, assertions of infringement of certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others have been made against us, and certain pending claims are in various stages of litigation. Based on our experience and customary industry practice, we believe that any licenses or other rights that might be necessary for us to continue with our current business could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Intellectual Property and Information Security-We may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services."
Customers
Avaya employs a flexible, go-to-market strategy to support our diverse customer base. Our customers range in size from small businesses employing a few individuals to large government agencies and multinational companies with tens of thousands of employees. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries, including financial services, manufacturing, retail, transportation, energy, media and communications, hospitality, health care, education and government. Our customers include leading Forbes Global 2000 companies across all these industries. For more information concerning the risks related to contracts with the U.S. federal government, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-Contracting with government entities can be complex, expensive and time-consuming."
Sales and Distribution
Our cloud first, global go-to-market strategy is designed to focus and strengthen our reach and impact on large multinational enterprises, midmarket and regional enterprises and small businesses. Our sales organizations are equipped to sell our comprehensive Avaya OneCloud portfolio complemented by services offerings including product support, integration and other professional services and enterprise cloud and managed services serving our customers in the way they prefer to work with us, 
either directly with Avaya or indirectly through our sales channels. Underneath our Avaya Edge Channel program, we have built an expansive network of cloud system integrators, technology solutions distributors (master agents), sales agents and other service providers which also have been enabled to market, sell and service our Avaya OneCloud portfolio along with our traditional global partner network consisting of strategic alliances, channel partners, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, telecommunications service providers and system integrators which have the ability to sell our full portfolio of offerings, including our Avaya OneCloud offerings.
We continue to focus on efficient deployment of Avaya sales resources, both directly and indirectly through our channel partners, for maximum market penetration and global growth. Our investment in our sales organization includes fully integrated curricula on the sales process, guided selling, sales enablement and on our solutions for all roles within our sales organization.
Seasonal trends impact the sale of our products. Typically, our second fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure-In addition to experiencing some seasonal trends, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and the results of one period may not provide a reliable indicator of our future performance." 
Development Partnerships
The Avaya DevConnect program is designed to promote the development, compliance-testing and co-marketing of innovative third-party products that are compatible with Avaya’s standards-based products. Member organizations have expertise in a broad range of technologies, including IP telephony, contact center and unified communications and collaboration applications.
As of September 30, 2021, over 33,000 companies have registered with the program, including approximately 300 companies operating at higher program levels, eligible for technical support and to submit their products or services for compatibility testing through the program by the Avaya Solution Interoperability and Test Lab ("Avaya Test Lab"). Avaya DevConnect engineers work in concert with each submitting member company to develop comprehensive test plans for each application to validate the product integrations.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs, furnished or approved by Avaya, and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may be necessary or appropriate. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components from third-party Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"), which we then resell separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand.
In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited number of suppliers. Delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations, although we have not yet had any such event have a material impact on us. For more information on risks related to products, components and logistics, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers. If these relationships are disrupted and we are unable to obtain substitute manufacturers, suppliers or partners, on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed."
Competition
Although we believe we are differentiated from any single competitor, the following represent the Company's primary competitors in various lines of our business:
•Enterprise UCC: Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Atos Unify, Cisco, Huawei, Microsoft and NEC.
•Midmarket UCC: Cisco, Microsoft, Mitel and NEC.
•Cloud Products and Services: 8x8, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (with RingCentral), Atos Unify (with RingCentral), Cisco, Fuze, Google, LogMeIn, Microsoft, Mitel, RingCentral, Twilio, Vonage and Zoom.
•Video Products and Solutions: BlueJeans, Cisco, Google, Huawei, LifeSize, LogMeIn, Microsoft, Poly, RingCentral, Yealink, Zoom and ZTE.
•Enterprise Contact Center Products and Services: Aspect Software, Cisco, Enghouse Interactive, Genesys, Huawei, Mitel and NEC.
•Midmarket Contact Center Products and Services: Amazon, Cisco, Five9, Genesys, NICE InContact, Serenova, Talkdesk, Twilio and Vonage.
We also face competition in certain geographies with companies that have a particular strength and focus in these regions, such as Huawei in China and Intelbras in Latin America. 
While we believe our global, in-house end-to-end services organization as well as our indirect channel provide us with a competitive advantage, we face competition from companies offering products and services directly or indirectly through their channel partners, as well as resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and network service providers.
For more information on risks related to our competition, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition- We face formidable competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions, and this competition may negatively impact our business and limit our growth."
Employees and Human Capital Management
Our Global Footprint
Our ability to attract, retain and engage diverse talent is critical to the successful execution of our strategy and delivering on our mission to create experiences that matter for our customers and employees. Our cultural principles of Simplicity, Trust, Accountability, Teamwork and Empowerment are foundational to our culture and serve as the framework for each phase of the employee life cycle.
As of September 30, 2021, we employed 8,063 employees, of which 39% were located in North America (United States and Canada), 24% were located in Asia Pacific, 9% were located in the Caribbean and Latin America and 28% were located in Europe, Middle East and Africa. In addition, 23% of our global employee headcount identified as female. In the United States, 28% of the employee headcount identified as female and 27% of our employees self-identified as a minority group. 
Of our 2,729 employees located in the United States, 11% are represented by a labor union. In certain foreign countries, our employees are represented by trade unions, work councils or collective bargaining agreements at the national level.
At Avaya, we champion an open, fair and supportive environment where our employees can thrive both professionally and personally. We work hard, give back to our communities, take care of our customers and promote high levels of employee engagement and well-being. Human capital management and environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters are woven into the everyday fabric of Avaya's culture and actively sponsored by our executive leadership. In addition, aspects of human capital management and ESG are overseen by our Board of Directors as well as the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
Our People First Strategy
Our people first strategy enables a culture that empowers our team members to leverage their strengths and experiences and also provides development and growth opportunities to sustain and expand our world class services and cultivate innovation. Underpinned by our cultural principles, our global population demonstrates the following attributes in the way we work and in everything we do:
•We espouse a customer-centric approach to focus on making our customers' lives simpler and more efficient.
•We foster a safe environment where innovative solutions are encouraged and rewarded.
•We encourage our people to speak up, take responsibility and embrace ownership.
•We lead by example and function as a transparent and dynamic team working towards a unified vision.
•We recognize one another for our achievements and strengths and value diversity of thought and the uniqueness of everyone in a collaborative environment.
•We empower our people to take risks, immerse themselves in the experience and drive customer success.
Employee Engagement
We enhance employee engagement by soliciting and addressing feedback, investing in our employees and promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.
We regularly conduct employee surveys to better understand and improve perceptions in the areas of engagement, recognition, career development, inclusion, leadership and management effectiveness and ethics and integrity. We met industry benchmark for participation rate in our most recent survey in 2021 with employee engagement of 84%. We use the feedback to identify opportunities and take action to continually strengthen our culture and enhance engagement, as demonstrated by our successful retention of 94% of our employees who were top-rated in our annual performance reviews and further validated by Forbes' recognition of Avaya as one of the World's Best Employers in 2021 for the second consecutive year.
At Avaya, we are acutely aware that developing our talent is both critical for continuing success in a rapidly evolving industry as well as for employee retention. We invest significant resources in professional development, career advancement and training for our global employee population. In addition to ongoing performance reviews and development discussions that occur as part of our formalized annual performance lifecycle, consistent, meaningful conversations are encouraged between employees and managers to continue the dialogue regarding aspirations, goals and career growth. 
We invested in new tools, resources and partnerships to further develop our internal capabilities to develop talent and build leadership acumen to support our business success in 2021. We made learning tools such as LinkedIn Learning available to all global employees, hosted leadership development programs with partners such as BetterUp and ZengerFolkman and launched initiatives to promote diversity awareness with Blue Ocean Brain.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEI&B) at Avaya
At Avaya, we drive and promote a clear strategy to build a workplace that mirrors the society in which we do business — a workplace where individuality is celebrated and harnessed to create a culture of engagement, innovation, inclusivity and belonging.
To successfully execute on our strategy, we have established a Global DEI&B Council, chaired by our CEO, to ensure alignment between our DEI&B strategy and our overall business strategy and a Global DEI&B Committee, chaired by our Chief Human Resources Officer, to ensure global calibration and oversee the execution of various DEI&B initiatives. 
In addition, we benefited from significant growth in Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"), employee-led groups that bring employees together to foster a sense of belonging, at Avaya. Following a revamp of the ERG process and design construct in 2020, we now have six active ERGs: Avaya Blacks Leading Empowerment (ABLE), Abilities Employee Resource Group (AERG), Asociacion Latinos Mundiales Avaya (ALMA), Asian Pacific Islanders @ Avaya (API@A), PRIDE, Veterans @ Avaya (VETA) and Women's Inspired Network@Avaya (WIN@A). ERG representatives serve on the Global DEI&B Committee to discuss insights, recommendations and initiatives with leadership. 
We focus on ensuring our hiring pipeline is accessible, dynamic and that we draw from a diverse pool of talent. To further these objectives, we utilize tools to support 'blind sourcing', conduct on-going training of our talent acquisition teams around topics such as unconscious bias, micro aggressions and inequities, and provide hiring managers toolkits to engage and attract diverse talent networks.
Employee Benefits
We provide comprehensive health insurance plans that include medical, dental and vision for our employees and their families in most countries. Our global employee population has access to employee assistance and wellness programs, including those covering financial wellness. 
We offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan that permits employees to use payroll deductions to purchase our stock at a 15% discount to market. Following a phased launch initiated in late 2020, we have been experiencing robust participation rates. Approximately 40% of our employees in the United States are active participants. In addition to the Employee Stock Purchase Program, in fiscal 2021 we extended our incentive equity program, increasing the number of recipients six-fold as of September 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year end, to further align our employees with stockholder interests and our continuing success as well as to enhance engagement. 
Corporate Responsibility
At Avaya, we are committed to ensuring the health and well-being of our employees, investing in our communities, creating products that are inherently sustainable, keeping our customers' solutions and data secure and reducing our environmental impact. Remaining steadfast in our commitment to combat climate change, Avaya exceeded its 2020 target by reducing Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions by 65% and Scope 3 emissions from business travel by 49% from 2014 levels. We plan to build on our achievements and continue the momentum as we develop new carbon emission reduction targets in support of the transition to a low carbon economy. Additional detail on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, including with respect to human capital, climate change and charitable giving, are included in our Corporate Responsibility Report and on our website.1
Employee Safety and Well-Being / Our Response to COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread and unpredictable impacts on global communities, economies and business practices, and continues to impact our global employees, partners and customers. Avaya successfully and swiftly instituted protocols and policies focused on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, including creating COVID

response teams, while maintaining business continuity and minimizing disruption to customer support and service delivery at the onset of the pandemic. 
We took immediate steps to modify employee travel policies, implemented office closures and allowed employees that were not critical to maintaining physical infrastructure to work remotely. Our COVID response teams continue to regularly review and adapt our policies to minimize health and safety risk based on evolving research and guidance and key COVID-19 related data. We facilitate data-informed executive decision-making and ensure consistent, regular and transparent communications with our employees and other stakeholders.
We are actively monitoring changes to regulations and guidance as we implement a phased re-opening of our offices, based on local circumstances and guided by safety. Our return to offices will incorporate new flexible work arrangements to combine the benefits of in-person collaboration with increased flexibility to drive both innovation and productivity. 
This year truly demonstrated the importance of not only protecting our employees' physical safety but caring for their mental health. We monitored our employees' well-being and implemented programs to ensure that employees felt fully supported. All Avaya employees have access to a complete wellness platform with resources and tools to track activity, get wellness advice, find healthy recipes, and access support on the road to achieving their health goals.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Avaya is subject to a wide range of governmental requirements relating to safety, health and environmental protection, including:
•certain provisions of environmental laws governing the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination;
•various local, federal and international laws and regulations regarding the material content and electrical design of our products that require us to be financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products; and
•various employee safety and health regulations that are imposed in various countries within which we operate, including those related to COVID-19. 
We are involved in a few remediations at currently or formerly owned or leased sites, which we do not believe will have a material impact on our business or results of operations.
Cybersecurity
Avaya has a vigorous, risk-based cybersecurity program, dedicated to protecting our data as well as data belonging to our customers and partners. We utilize a defensive in-depth strategy, with multiple layers of security controls to protect our data and solutions. Organizationally, we have a Product Security Council, cross-functional Cyber Incident Response teams, Security Operations Centers, and strong governance to ensure compliance with our security policies and protocols. These teams are comprised of experts across our enterprise, as well as outside experts, to ensure that we are monitoring the effectiveness of our cybersecurity governance and vulnerability management programs.
