ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 
Tauriga Sciences, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Florida corporation, with its principal place of business being located at 555 Madison Avenue, Fifth Floor, New York, NY 10022. The Company has, over time, moved into that of a diversified life sciences technology company, with its mission to operate a revenue generating business, while continuing to evaluate potential acquisition candidates operating in the life sciences technology space.
Tauriga Pharma Corp.
 
On January 4, 2018, the Company announced the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary in Delaware. This subsidiary, incorporated in Delaware, was initially named Tauriga IP Acquisition Corp., which changed its name to Tauriga Biz Dev Corp. on March 25, 2018, and most recently (January 2020) changed its name to Tauriga Pharma Corp.
 
Effective January 2020, the Company amended the certificate of incorporation of Tauriga Business Development Corp. in relevant part to effectuate a name change of this subsidiary to Tauriga Pharma Corp. The principal reason for the name change is to align this subsidiary’s focus on the development of a pharmaceutical product line that is synergistic with the Company’s primary CBD product line. Currently, the plan is to initially create a pharmaceutical line of products to address nausea symptoms related to chemotherapy treatment in patients, which we will submit for clinical trials and to regulatory agencies for approval.
 
On March 18, 2020, the Company filed a Provisional U.S. Patent Application covering its Pharmaceutical grade version of Tauri-Gum™. This patent application, filed with the United States Patent & Trademark Office (“U.S.P.T.O.”), is titled: “MEDICATED CBD COMPOSITIONS, METHODS OF MANUFACTURING, AND METHODS OF TREATMENT.” The Company’s proposed Pharmaceutical grade version of Tauri-Gum™ is being developed for nausea regulation, intended specifically to target patients subjected to ongoing chemotherapy treatment(s) (the “Indication”). The delivery system for this Pharmaceutical product is an improved version of the existing “Tauri-Gum™” chewing gum formulation based on continued research and development.
 
Tauriga Sciences Limited
 
On June 10, 2019, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Tauriga Sciences Limited, with the registrar of Companies for Northern Ireland. Tauriga Sciences Limited is a private limited Company.

Collaboration Agreement with Aegea Biotechnologies Inc.
 
On April 3, 2020, Tauriga Sciences, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement (“Collaboration Agreement”) with Aegea Biotechnologies Inc. (“Aegea”), for the purpose of developing a Rapid, Multiplexed Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Point of Care Test with Superior Sensitivity and Selectivity (the “SARS-Col 2 Test”). The parties believe that the benefits of the SARS-CoV-2 Test are as follows: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 test with the sensitivity and specificity to eliminate false negatives and false positives, and with the ability to detect and measure viral shed, even in patients who are asymptomatic. This SARS-CoV-2 test would use Aegea’s patented technologies to take coronavirus testing to the next level by differentiating different strains of SARS-CoV-2. The test, if successful, would be adaptable to additional SARS-CoV-2 strain types as necessary and as the virus mutates. It also has the possibility to be rapidly be customized to provide similarly sensitive and specific assays for other viruses. The Company has committed to raise funding for the purposes set forth in under the Collaboration Agreement from its $5,000,000 Equity Line of Credit (“ELOC”). Seventy percent (70%) of the net proceeds from the sale of the initial 10,000,000 shares of our Common Stock under the ELOC will be invested in Aegea for the development of the Covid Test and used to purchase shares of common stock of Aegea at a purchase price of $4.00 per share. As of the date of this annual report, the Company has contributed a total of $183,442 towards this collaboration agreement, a portion of which was funded through the sale of our Common Stock under our existing ELOC. See also the description of our investments in the Notes to our financial statements in Note 12 - Investments and Note 15 – Subsequent Events, as well as in agreements filed by us as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in this annual report.

Pursuant to the amended terms of the Collaboration Agreement, following the initial sale of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock under the ELOC, twenty percent (20%) of all subsequent net proceeds from the sale of shares under the ELOC shall be used to purchase additional shares of common stock of Aegea at a purchase price of $4.00 per share. The $4.00 stock price corresponds to a current pre-money valuation of Aegea of $25,000,000 for each tranche of cash, up to the first $2,000,000 of our investment in Aegea. The valuation will be reassessed and reset by the parties after the first $2,000,000 of Tauriga’s investment is received by Aegea. In addition, as part of our agreement with Aegea, On May 26, 2020, Tauriga also issued to Aegea 5,000,000 unregistered common shares of Tauriga common stock. The Collaboration Agreement commenced on signing and will continue indefinitely, unless amended or terminated by mutual written agreement of the parties.

REGULATORY MATTERS
 
Food and Drug Administration
 
On May 31, 2019, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) held public hearings to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD. The hearing came approximately five months after the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (more commonly known as the Farm Bill), went into effect and removed industrial hemp from the Schedule I prohibition under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (industrial hemp means cannabis plants and derivatives that contain no more than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, on a dry weight basis).
 
Though the Farm Bill removed industrial hemp from the Schedule I list, the Farm Bill preserved the regulatory authority of the FDA over cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds used in food and pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA has been clear that it intends to use this authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, in the same manner as any other food or drug ingredient. In addition to holding the hearing, the agency had requested comments by July 2, 2019 regarding any health and safety risks of CBD use, and how products containing CBD are currently produced and marketed, which comment period was concluded on July 16, 2019. As of the date hereof, the FDA has taken the position that it is unlawful to put into interstate commerce food products containing hemp derived CBD, or to market CBD as, or in, a dietary supplement. Furthermore, since the closure of the FDA hearings on this issue, some state and local agencies have issued a ban on the sale of any food or beverages containing CBD. H.R. 5587, a newly introduced legislative effort at the federal level, seeks to consider hemp-derived CBD and substances containing hemp-derived CBD to be dietary supplements under the FD&C Act, which would likely resolve ambiguity and provide clear guidance to stakeholders about how to comply with applicable FDA law. However, H.R. 5587 was only recently introduced in the House of Representatives, and is in its infancy, requiring further approvals, including approval of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the President of the United States before being enacted into law, if at all.

Furthermore, with respect to Company’s developing CBG product line, the FDA has provided no guidance as to how cannabinoids other than CBD (sch as CBG) shall be regulated under the FD&C Act, and it is unclear at this time how such potential regulation could affect the results of the operations or prospects of the Company or this product line.
 
See our Risk Factors for more information about these items, as well as certain related disclosures included our Results of Operations under the heading “Going Concern”.
 
The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding, success in developing and marketing its products and the level of competition and potential regulatory enforcement actions. These risks and others are described in greater detail in the Risk Factors set forth in this prospectus.
 
2019 Increase in Authorized Shares
 
On July 26, 2019, the Company held a meeting of its board of directors.

The increase in the authorized shares was approved by the shareholders of record at a special meeting of shareholders on September 10, 2019, and the Company promptly filed its Amended Articles of Incorporation with the division of corporations of the State of Florida to effectuate the increase in authorized shares, which was formally accepted by the Florida Division of Corporations on September 12, 2019.

The “Purchase Price” of the shares of our Common Stock that we may sell to Tangiers will be 88% of the lowest VWAP of the Common Stock during the five (5) consecutive Trading Days including and immediately following the applicable to the Put Notice, provided, however, an additional 10% will be added to the discount of each Put if (i) the Company is not DWAC eligible and (ii) an additional 15% will be added to the discount of each Put if the Company is under DTC “chill” status on the applicable Put Notice Date.

During February of 2018, the Company’s strategy with respect to the HerMan® product was negatively impacted by a series of product defects relating to the twisting mechanism of the lip balm tube. As a result of this and the concomitant halting of selling efforts, the Company had no sales of the HerMan® product during the year ended March 31, 2019. The Company has removed the product from the website and the remaining inventory was written-off as it was determined that the units were not usable.

Pilus Energy
 
On January 28, 2014, the Company acquired Pilus Energy, LLC (“Pilus”), an Ohio limited liability company and a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that create electricity while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater.

Blink Charging Company
 
On March 29, 2018 the Company’s then named subsidiary - Tauriga Biz Dev Corp. - entered into an independent sales representative agreement with Blink Charging Company (NASDAQ: BLNK) (“BLINK”). Under this agreement we became a non-exclusive independent sales representative to solicit orders from potential customers for EV (“Electric Vehicle”) Stations placement. This sales agreement is a three-tier compensation model based on whether we contract the new customer to purchase equipment outright from BLINK or enter into one of two revenue-sharing agreements. If our subsidiary effectuates a sale of BLINK equipment it will receive a one-time sales commission based on the sales price of the equipment sale. In the case where our subsidiary secures a revenue sharing agreement with a customer where BLINK remains the owner, then our subsidiary will be paid an on-going commission based off of gross charger revenue, subject to which party paid for the installation. Commission payments under the revenue sharing agreement are subject to minimum revenue generation hurdles.
 
On June 29, 2018, the Company purchased four BLINK Level – 2 - 40” pedestal chargers for permanent placement in a retail location or locations whereby the Company will pay a variable annual fee based on 7% of total revenue per charging unit. The rest of the proceeds will be split 80/20 between the Company and the host location owner or its assignee. The host location owner will pay for the cost of providing power to these unit as well as installation costs. As of December 31, 2019, we have not installed any of these machines in any locations, and no revenue has been generated through the Blink contract. Management has not made any decision regarding placement of these units at this time. The Company has not decided to abandon this business line, and therefore, we have not reclassified these assets as held for sale.
