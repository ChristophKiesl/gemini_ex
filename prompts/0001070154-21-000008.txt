ITEM 1.Business
The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report.
Sterling Bancorp
We are a Delaware corporation, bank holding company and financial holding company founded in 1998 that owns all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our principal subsidiary, the Bank. At December 31, 2020, we had, on a consolidated basis, $29.8 billion in assets, $23.1 billion in deposits, stockholders’ equity of $4.6 billion and 192,923,371 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Our financial condition and results of operations are discussed herein on a consolidated basis with the Bank and our other subsidiaries.
Sterling National Bank
The Bank is a full-service regional bank founded in 1888. Headquartered in Pearl River, New York, the Bank specializes in the delivery of services and solutions to business owners, their families and consumers within the communities we serve through teams of dedicated and experienced relationship managers. The Bank offers a complete line of commercial, business, and consumer banking products and services. 
Subsidiaries 
We conduct substantially all of our business operations through the Bank. The Bank has a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries, including a company that originates loans to municipalities and governmental entities and acquires securities issued by state and local governments, a real estate investment trust that holds real estate mortgage loans, and several subsidiaries that hold foreclosed properties acquired by the Bank. We also own other subsidiaries that have an immaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Strategy
The Bank operates as a regional bank providing a broad offering of deposit, lending and wealth management products to commercial, consumer and municipal clients in the Greater New York metropolitan area and nationally. The Bank targets the following geographic markets: (i) the New York Metro Market, which includes Manhattan and Long Island; and (ii) the New York Suburban Market, which includes Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester Counties in New York and Bergen County in New Jersey. The New York Metro-Market and Mew York Suburban Market combined generate approximately 73% of our revenues. Through our asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables, equipment finance and public sector finance businesses the Bank also originates loans and deposits in select markets nationally including California, Connecticut, Michigan, Texas and Illinois. We believe the Bank operates in an attractive footprint that presents us with significant opportunities to execute our strategy of targeting small and middle market commercial clients and affluent consumers. We believe that this is a client segment that is underserved by larger bank competitors in our market area. 
Our primary strategic objective is to generate sustainable growth in revenue and earnings over time while driving positive operating leverage. We define operating leverage, which is a non-GAAP measurement, as the ratio of growth in adjusted total revenue divided by growth in adjusted total operating expenses. To achieve this goal, we focus on the following initiatives:
•Target specific “high value” client segments and industry sectors in which we have competitive advantages and can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
•Deploy a single point of contact, relationship-based distribution strategy through our commercial banking teams, business banking teams and financial centers, in which our colleagues are directly responsible for managing all aspects of the client relationship and experience. 
•Augment our distribution and client coverage strategy with a contemporary digital product and service offering that provides our commercial and consumer clients with the flexibility to self-serve or interact with us through various channels.
•Expand into new technology-enabled, growth-oriented business verticals, including direct banking offerings and leverage our platform and technology to provide banking to other financial services providers (“Banking as a Service”). 
•Invest in technology to build a robust operating platform that uses artificial intelligence and related automation tools to maximize efficiency.
•Create a high productivity culture through differentiated compensation programs based on a pay-for-performance philosophy.
•Maintain and continue to enhance our strong risk management systems and proactively manage enterprise risk.
We focus on building client relationships that allow us to gather low cost core deposits and originate high quality loans. We maintain a disciplined pricing strategy on deposits that allows us to compete for loans while generating an appropriate risk adjusted return. We deploy a team-based distribution strategy in which clients are served by a focused and experienced group of relationship managers who are responsible for all aspects of the client relationship and delivery of our products and services. We offer diverse loan products to commercial businesses, real estate owners, real estate developers, municipalities and consumers. 
We augment organic growth with opportunistic acquisitions of banks and other financial services businesses. These acquisitions have supported our expansion into attractive markets and have diversified our business lines. See additional disclosure of our acquisitions in Note 2. “Acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Competition
The greater New York metropolitan region is a highly competitive market area with a concentration of financial institutions, a number of which are significantly larger institutions with greater financial resources than us. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial services companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from non-depository competitors such as mutual funds, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. 
Human Capital Resources
We are committed to investing in our colleagues. Our significant accomplishments are a direct result of the collaboration, determination, initiative, and integrity of our team of dedicated professionals. Our colleagues embrace our values to exceed expectations, in-line with our corporate philosophy of “Above and beyond is standard procedure here.”
Our performance management program recognizes and rewards superior performance based on objective and consistent measurements.
Demographics
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,460 full-time equivalent employees consisting of 59% female and 41% male. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit.
Attrition
We monitor employee turnover rates and tenure rates in the aggregate and on a per business unit. As of December 31, 2020, the average tenure of our employees was approximately nine and a half years. We believe that our competitive compensation practices including a broad and comprehensive employee benefits program assist in driving employee engagement and retention. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to creating an equitable, diverse, and inclusive workplace. We partner with Diversity Best Practices, an organization that provides us with best practices and solutions to enhance our corporate culture and strategies on how to implement, grow measure and create first-in-class diversity programs, and with Getting Hired, a recruiting firm that helps us hire veterans with disabilities, provides access to thought leadership and, more broadly, assist us in our efforts to increase awareness regarding issues related to diversity and inclusion, by providing ongoing education, initiatives and programs on matters of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide our colleagues with a competitive compensation and benefits package that rewards them:

•for work required for each position as defined in written job descriptions; 
•in accordance with salary grades that reflect the value of each position to us and its internal relationship to other positions as determined by “job evaluations;”
•at a fair level, by establishing a salary structure that has a sound relationship to compensation paid for similar positions in the labor market; 
•in an amount that reflects each individual’s performance as measured against our strategic goals through an objective and consistent procedure; and 
•for the direct and specific contributions of colleagues to the success of our mission.
We provide a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary and variable cash and other incentives. In addition, as part of our long-term incentive plan for executives and certain colleagues, we provide equity-based compensation as part of our pay-for-performance culture and to attract, retain and motivate our key leaders.
We seek to prioritize the health and well-being of our colleagues. To that end we offer a competitive and contemporary benefits program that supports our colleagues physical, financial and emotional well-being. We provide our employees with access to flexible and affordable medical programs, dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time-off, employee assistance programs, short-term disability insurance and term-life insurance. We offer a wide variety of voluntary benefits such as long-term disability insurance, pet insurance, accident insurance and hospital indemnity insurance. We provide subsidized child and elder care programs in order to meet the work life demands of our colleagues. We provide our colleagues with access to a 401(k) retirement plan (with a competitive employer match and profit sharing component) and certain eligible employees may elect to participate in a deferred compensation plan.
Commitment to Values and Ethics
Conducting our business in an ethical manner and creating and adhering to a “Culture of Compliance” is a core tenet of our business and philosophy. Our Code of Ethics and compliance framework promotes accountability for appropriate risk management and for full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. By creating and promoting a “Culture of Compliance” throughout our organization, and through consistent internal messaging and other educational initiatives, we demonstrate our commitment to behaving honestly, treating others fairly and acting with integrity. Our framework is grounded in the following core values: 
•High Achievement
•Accountability
•Initiative
•Collaboration
•Integrity
Professional Development and Training
We believe in robust employee training as a retention and professional development tool. We have developed and deployed training programs across all levels of the organization to meet the needs of various roles, specialized skill sets and departments. We provide general compliance and regulatory education in addition to training specific to each colleagues’ role. We also provide general workplace safety, security and confidentiality training. 
Communication and Engagement
We believe that to be successful, our colleagues need to understand how their work contributes to our overall strategy. We communicate with our colleagues through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication. We hold quarterly senior leadership town hall meetings led by our CEO, which include detailed discussions and presentations by our senior executive officers and are available to the majority of our colleagues. We provide frequent corporate email communications and we conduct regular employee engagement surveys.
Effect of Compliance with Supervision and Governmental Regulation
General
We and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws, significant elements of which are described below. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies referenced. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory 
agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or various policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulatory Agencies
We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a bank and a financial holding company, we are regulated under the BHC Act, and our subsidiaries are subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the FRB as our primary federal regulator.
As a national bank, the Bank is principally subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, as well as the FDIC. Further, because the Bank’s total assets exceed $10 billion, it is also subject to CFPB supervision. Insured banks, including the Bank, are subject to extensive regulations that relate to, among other things: (i) the nature and amount of loans that may be made by the Bank and the rates of interest that may be charged; (ii) types and amounts of other investments; (iii) branching; (iv) permissible activities; (v) reserve requirements; and (vi) dealings with officers, directors and affiliates.
Bank Holding Company Activities
In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB), without prior approval of the FRB.
To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed.” A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be “well capitalized” if it satisfies the requirements discussed in the section captioned “Prompt Corrective Action.” A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well managed” if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent FRB examination. A financial holding company’s status also depends upon it maintaining its status as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable FRB regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the FRB’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions.
The FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to order the bank holding company to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate the acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank or bank holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FRB or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for the Bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the impact on competition, public benefit of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the CRA and fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations policies and procedures in combating money laundering.
Capital Requirements
We are required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the FRB, and the Bank is required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the OCC. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to us and the Bank are based on the December 2010 capital standards enumerated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, known as the Basel III Capital Rules.
The fully phased-in Basel III Capital Rules require us and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios as follows (i) Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at 
least 8.5%, and (iii) Total Capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%; and a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets below the (7%) minimum will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
In addition, under the previously applicable general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we and the Bank made a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, trust preferred securities no longer included in our Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out.
The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weighting that expanded the risk-weighting categories to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.
With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations contained in Section 38 of the FDIA, as discussed in the section captioned “Prompt Corrective Action.”
Management believes that we and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules as of December 31, 2020. 
Prompt Corrective Action
The FDIA requires among other things, that federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA regime includes the following five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures pursuant to the Basel III Capital Rules are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio, the leverage ratio and the ratio of tangible equity to average quarterly tangible assets.
A bank will be (i) “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0% and is not “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 risk-based capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0% and is not “critically undercapitalized”; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” An “undercapitalized” institution is are subject to growth limitations and is required to submit a capital restoration plan to its principal regulator. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the “undercapitalized” depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized,” and may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
We believe that as of December 31, 2020, the Bank was “well capitalized” based on the aforementioned ratios. For further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of the Company and the Bank, please see the discussion in the section captioned “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 18. “Stockholders’ Equity - Regulatory Capital Requirements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements, all of which are included elsewhere in this report.
Dividend Restrictions
We depend on funds maintained or generated by our subsidiaries, principally the Bank, for our cash requirements. Dividend payments to us from the Bank, are not subject to prior regulatory approval but, are subject to regulatory limitations. Under the National Bank Act, without consent, a national bank may declare, in any one year, dividends only in an amount aggregating not more than the sum of its net profits for such year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit us from paying dividends if the supervising agency determines that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
Source of Strength Doctrine
FRB policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks.
Deposit Insurance
Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC, and the Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The deposit insurance provided by the FDIC is capped per account owner at $250 thousand of the total deposits across all accounts held at a single depositary institution. 
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit an insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based upon supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital level, and certain other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. The range of current assessment rates is currently 1.5 to 40 basis points. As the DIF reserve ratio grows, the rate schedule will be adjusted downward. The FDIC has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates, subject to limits, and to impose special additional assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. 
FDIC deposit insurance expense totaled $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. FDIC deposit insurance expense included deposit insurance assessments and Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessments related to outstanding bonds issued by FICO in the late 1980s to recapitalize the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessments were paid in full with the March 31, 2019 assessment.
Safety and Soundness Regulations
In accordance with the FDIA, the federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies authorize the agencies to require that an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing corrective actions and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. If the institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and impose civil monetary penalties.
Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines that apply to us and the Bank and prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, that encourage inappropriate risk takings by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators were required to establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed an initial version of such regulations in April 2011 and a revised version in May 2016, which largely retained the provisions from the April 2011 version. As of the date of this report, the regulations are still under review by the agencies and have not been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the revised form proposed in May 2016, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives.
In June 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers compensation for all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, discussed above.
The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as ours, that are not “large, complex banking organizations”. These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in the reports of examination. Deficiencies are incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
Loans to a Single or Related Group of Borrowers
The Bank generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. Unimpaired capital and surplus includes the Bank’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital included in our risk-based capital calculation plus the balance of our allowance for credit losses not included in our Tier 2 capital. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2020, management believes the Bank was in compliance with these restrictions.
Community Reinvestment Act
The CRA requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings that must be publicly disclosed. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of certain applications. The Bank received a rating of “satisfactory” in its most recent CRA exam, which was conducted in 2020.
Financial Privacy
The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These regulations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. 
The Bank is also subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These guidelines describe the federal banking agencies’ expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities.
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act
A major focus of governmental policy related to financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions, creating new crimes and penalties, and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure by a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act amended the BHC Act to require that the federal bank regulatory agencies adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading, investing activities and from acquiring and retaining ownership interest in certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds), commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”. The Volcker Rule also requires covered banking entities, including us and the Bank, to implement certain compliance programs, and the complexity and rigor of such programs is determined based on the asset size and complexity of the business of the covered company. 
Durbin Amendment
The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions which restrict interchange fees to those that are “reasonable and proportionate” for certain debit card issuers, and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing. This statutory provision is known as the “Durbin Amendment.” The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011. In the final rules, interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at $0.21 plus five basis points in order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate. The interchange fee restrictions contained in the Durbin Amendment, and the rules promulgated thereunder, only apply to debit card issuers with $10.0 billion or more in total consolidated assets, which includes the Bank.
Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are regulated by the FRB under sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related FRB regulations. These regulations limit the types and amounts of covered transactions that the Bank can engage in and requires those transactions be on an arm’s-length basis. The term “affiliate” is defined to mean any company that controls or is under common control with the Bank and includes us and our non-bank subsidiaries. “Covered transactions” include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In general, these regulations require that any such transaction by the Bank (or its subsidiaries) with an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis.
Federal law also limits the Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB in an amount at least equal to the sum of the membership stock purchase requirement, determined on an annual basis at the end of each calendar year, and the activity-based stock purchase requirement, determined on a daily basis. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was in compliance with the minimum stock ownership requirement.
Federal Reserve System
FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against balances in their net transaction accounts, primarily interest bearing demand deposit accounts and non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced reserve requirements ratios to zero percent. Prior to this change, the reserve requirement ratios on net transactions accounts differed based on the balance held in net transactions accounts at the Bank. A balance in net transaction accounts below a certain amount, known as the “reserve requirement exemption amount,” was subject to a reserve requirement ratio of zero percent. Net transaction account 
balances above the reserve requirement exemption amount and up to a specified amount, known as the “low reserve tranche,” (between $16.9 million and $127.5 million in 2020) were subject to a reserve requirement ratio of 3%. Net transaction account balances above the low reserve tranche were subject to a reserve requirement of 10%. The Bank was in compliance with the foregoing requirements for the period of January 1 through March 26, 2020 when the reserve requirement was reduced to zero percent.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
Given extensive implementation and enforcement powers over all banks with over $10.0 billion in assets, including the Bank, the CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection financial laws that apply to all banks including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive, or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial protection laws, hold hearings and commence civil litigation. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity that is found to be in violation of federal consumer financial protection law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction.
