Overview

We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel bile acid modulators to treat orphan pediatric liver diseases and other liver or gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. Our product Bylvay has been approved in the United States for the treatment of pruritis in patients with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) ages 3 months or older, and authorized in Europe for the treatment of PFIC in patients ages 6 months or older. In October 2021, the FDA granted the Company orphan drug exclusivity for Bylvay for the treatment of pruritis in patients ages 3 months or older with PFIC. In July 2021, the EMA granted the Company orphan drug exclusivity for Bylvay for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. In September 2021, Bylvay was also granted marketing authorization by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, for the treatment of PFIC in patients 6 months or older. Bylvay is available by prescription to patients in the U.S. and became available by prescription to patients in Germany in September 2021. PFIC is a rare, life-threatening genetic disorder affecting young children and Bylvay is the first approved drug treatment in the disease. 
​
We are also pursuing the development of Bylvay in biliary atresia and in Alagille syndrome (ALGS), each of which is a rare, life threatening disease that affects the liver and for which there is no approved pharmacologic treatment option. We initiated a pivotal clinical trial of Bylvay in biliary atresia, the BOLD trial, in the first half of 2020. At the end of 2021, we had enrolled over 50% of the targeted patients in the trial. We expect topline results from the BOLD trial in 2024. We also initiated a pivotal trial of Bylvay in ALGS, the ASSERT trial, in the fourth quarter of 2020.We expect topline results from the ASSERT trial by the end of 2022.
​
We are expanding development to compounds that are intended for adult liver and viral diseases. Our lead candidate for adult liver diseases, A3907, is a selective inhibitor of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) that has, based on animal studies, high predicted oral bioavailability and systemic exposures in man. As a result, A3907 has the potential to not only affect the bile acid pool by increased bile acid excretion in the stools but also through other pathways, including increased urinary bile acid excretion. This unique approach may yield greater dosing flexibility, greater efficacy and lower rates of adverse events, such as diarrhea, associated with the non-systemic IBAT inhibitors acting locally in the intestine. In December 2021, we announced topline results from our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adult subjects to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of orally administered A3907. In the top-line results the trial achieved both primary and secondary objectives. A3907 was safe and well tolerated in the Phase 1 clinical trial at systemic exposures that demonstrated therapeutic benefits in preclinical models. With the potential to inhibit ileal, renal and hepatic ASBT, we hope A3907 will provide the optimal balance of efficacy and tolerability in patients in multiple liver diseases. A composition of matter patent for A3907 has been granted. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial for A3907 in adult liver disease by the end of 2022.
 ​
We also have a preclinical program in adult liver and viral diseases. Our lead preclinical candidate for adult viral and liver diseases is A2342, a potent small molecule inhibitor of the sodium-taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP). NTCP is a key transporter of bile acids into the liver cells and also serves as the entry mechanism for the hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis D (HDV) viruses. A2342 protects primary human hepatocytes from HBV infection in vitro. In addition, A2342 reduces markers of infection in HBV-infected humanized mice. A2342 has demonstrated target engagement in non-human primates with biomarker increases comparable to increases achieved in humans by a now commercial subcutaneous peptide NTCP inhibitor. A composition of matter patent for A2342 has been granted, 

4



and IND enabling studies are being completed. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 trial for A2342 in healthy volunteers by the end of 2022. Preclinical efforts with other bile acid modulator approaches continue.
​
The first IBAT inhibitor developed by Albireo is elobixibat, which was approved in Japan and Thailand for the treatment of chronic constipation and is marketed by our partner EA Pharma or its sublicensee in Thailand.

​
Bylvay — Our Lead Product for PFIC.
Bylvay (odevixibat) was approved by the FDA on July 20, 2021 for the treatment of pruritis in patients ages 3 months or older with PFIC, and authorized by the European Medicines Agency on July 16, 2021 for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. Bylvay was also granted marketing authorization by the MHRA on September 7, 2021 for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. We also received a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (PRV) from the FDA in connection with the U.S. approval of Bylvay. In September 2021, we sold the PRV for $105.0 million. Bylvay is available by prescription to patients in the U.S. and we announced in September 2021 that Bylvay became available by prescription to patients in Germany. In July 2021, the EMA granted the Company orphan drug exclusivity for Bylvay for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. In October 2021, the FDA granted the Company orphan drug exclusivity for Bylvay for the treatment of pruritis in PFIC patients ages 3 months or older.
​
The precise prevalence of PFIC is unknown, and we are not aware of any patient registries or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients with PFIC in any geography. PFIC has been estimated to affect between one in every 75,000 children born worldwide. Based on the published incidence, published regional populations, and estimated median life expectancies, we estimate the prevalence of PFIC across the spectrum of the disease to be approximately 15,000 patients worldwide, not including China and India, but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of PFIC with precision. Apart from rights we granted to third parties in the below agreements, we hold global rights to Bylvay unencumbered. Our current plan is to commercialize Bylvay ourselves in the United States and Europe. We have entered into a fee for service promotional agreement with Travere Therapeutics, Inc. to promote Bylvay in the United States. The initial term of the arrangement is two years from launch of Bylvay, terminable at will by either party after one year following launch. We have also entered into license agreements with third parties to commercialize Bylvay in certain other jurisdictions, subject to regulatory approval in those jurisdictions including, Medison Pharma Ltd. for Israel, Gen İlaç ve Sağlık Ürünleri Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. for Turkey, Genpharm Services for Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE, Jadeite Medicines Inc. for Japan, and Swixx Biopharma AG for Central and Eastern European Countries, and we are identifying potential partners for other regions. Bylvay is currently the only approved drug for the treatment of patients with PFIC. Ursodeoxycholic acid, or UDCA, is approved in France only for PFIC type 3, and in the United States and elsewhere for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. However, many PFIC patients do not respond well to UDCA, undergo partial external bile diversion, or PEBD, surgery and often require liver transplantation. PEBD surgery is a life-altering and undesirable procedure in which bile is drained outside the body to a stoma bag that must be worn by the patient 24 hours a day.
Other indications under development for Bylvay.
We are also pursuing the development of Bylvay in patients with biliary atresia, another rare, life-threatening disease that affects the liver and for which there is no approved pharmacologic treatment option. In December 2018, the European Commission granted orphan designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia, and in January 2019, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia. We initiated the BOLD clinical trial, a global pivotal trial and the largest prospective intervention trial ever conducted in biliary atresia, in the first half of 2020. At the end of 2021, we had enrolled over 50% of the targeted patients in the trial. We expect topline results in 2024. We believe biliary atresia is one of the most common rare pediatric liver diseases, and is the leading cause of liver transplants in children. Our double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal trial in biliary atresia is designed to enroll approximately 200 patients at 70 sites globally. Patients will receive either placebo or odevixibat once daily at 120µg/kg. The primary endpoint is survival with native liver after two years of treatment.

​
Biliary atresia is a partial or total blocking or absence of large bile ducts that causes cholestasis and resulting accumulation of bile that damages the liver. The estimated worldwide incidence of biliary atresia is between 6 and 10 for every 100,000 live births. We estimate the prevalence of biliary atresia to be approximately 18,000 patients across the U.S. and Europe, and approximately 27,000 combined in other jurisdictions worldwide, but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of biliary atresia with precision. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of biliary atresia. The current standard of care is a surgery known as the Kasai procedure, or hepatoportoenterostomy, in which the obstructed bile ducts are removed and a section of the small intestine is connected to the liver directly. However, only an estimated 25% of those initially undergoing the Kasai procedure will survive to their twenties without need for liver transplantation.
​
In addition, we initiated a pivotal trial of Bylvay in ALGS, the ASSERT trial, in the fourth quarter of 2020. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 45 patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS across 35 sites in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific. We expect topline data to be available by the end of 2022. ALGS is a genetic condition associated with liver, heart, eye, kidney and skeletal abnormalities. In particular, ALGS patients have fewer than normal bile ducts inside the liver, which leads to cholestasis and the accumulation of bile and causes scarring in the liver. ALGS is estimated to affect between one in every 50,000 children born worldwide. We estimate the prevalence of ALGS to be approximately 12,000 patients across the U.S. and Europe, and approximately 13,000 combined in other jurisdictions worldwide, but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of ALGS with precision. Current treatment for ALGS is generally in line with current treatments for PFIC as described above. In August 2012, the European Commission granted orphan designation to odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS. In October 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS.
​
We continue to evaluate potential clinical development in other indications, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, which refers to swelling (inflammation), scarring, and destruction of bile ducts inside and outside of the liver. The first symptoms are typically fatigue, itching and jaundice, and many patients with sclerosing cholangitis also suffer from inflammatory bowel disease. The estimated incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 9 cases per 100,000 people. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of sclerosing cholangitis. First-line treatment is typically off-label UDCA, although UDCA has not been established to be safe and effective in patients with sclerosing cholangitis in well controlled clinical trials.
The Role of Bile Acids and IBAT
The liver is responsible for many vital body functions, including the regulation of bile acid synthesis and metabolism. The liver uses cholesterol to produce bile acids, which are then transported to, and stored in, the gall bladder. In response to food ingestion, the gall bladder contracts and releases bile acids into the small intestine where they promote digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.
After completing digestion, bile acids bind to IBAT, which is sometimes referred to as the apical sodium bile acid transporter, or ASBT, at a location at the end of the small intestine known as the terminal ileum. As depicted below, 

6



IBAT then initiates the transport of bile acids across the intestinal wall through the portal vein back to the liver in the enterohepatic circulation process.

In healthy persons, approximately 95% of bile acids recirculate back to the liver, with the remainder being excreted to the colon. The liver produces a small amount of new bile acids every day to make up for this loss.
In addition to their role in digestion, bile acids are important signaling molecules that help regulate a network of metabolic pathways throughout the GI system. Bile acids bind to receptors in the colon that promote the release of intestinal hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, that can stimulate insulin release from the pancreas and, over time, decrease levels of plasma hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c, a measure of glucose. In the liver, bile acids bind to other receptors that regulate bile acid production from cholesterol. Under normal conditions, bile acids bind to these receptors and inhibit the synthesis of new bile acids. As bile acid levels are lowered, the liver produces needed bile acids from cholesterol, which requires increased uptake of cholesterol and results in the decrease of cholesterol levels in the liver and otherwise in circulation in the body.
Cholestatic liver disease results in the accumulation of elevated bile acids in the liver and in the serum. Elevated bile acid levels are linked with progressive liver disease. In addition, although a direct causative correlation has not been definitely established, there is substantial clinical support linking elevated serum bile acids to pruritus, a challenging symptom impacting patients with cholestatic liver disease.
Interruption of enterohepatic circulation in patients with PFIC or ALGS surgically via the partial external biliary diversion, or PEBD, procedure has been shown to lower serum bile acid levels, relieve pruritus, improve clinical outcomes and delay the progression of serious liver disease. Bylvay is designed to treat patients with PFIC and other cholestatic liver diseases pharmacologically by inhibiting IBAT to reduce bile acids in the liver and serum, while at the same time reducing pruritus. In addition to the beneficial effects that may be achievable through IBAT inhibition, Bylvay is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in minimal systemic exposure of the drug to the body.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for orphan pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders where there is high unmet medical need, while also leveraging our expertise in 

7



bile acid modulation to treat other liver and GI diseases and disorders. To achieve our goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies.

● | Continue to commercialize Bylvay for patients with PFIC in the United States and Europe. Bylvay was approved by the FDA on July 20, 2021 for the treatment of pruritis in patients ages 3 months or older with PFIC, and authorized by the European Medicines Agency on July 16, 2021 for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. Bylvay was also granted marketing authorization by the MHRA on September 7, 2021 for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. Bylvay is available by prescription to patients in the U.S., and in September 2021, Bylvay became available by prescription to patients in Germany. We plan to launch Bylvay in additional markets in 2022.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize the benefit and commercial potential of Bylvay by expanding development to additional orphan pediatric cholestatic indications. Beyond PFIC, we also believe Bylvay can benefit children suffering from other cholestatic diseases and disorders. We initiated a pivotal clinical trial with Bylvay for the treatment of biliary atresia, the BOLD trial, in the first half of 2020. At the end of 2021, we had enrolled over 50% of the targeted patients in the trial. We expect topline results from the BOLD trial in 2024. We estimate that biliary atresia impacts an aggregate of 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe, with another 27,000 patients in other jurisdictions worldwide, and is the cause of over 50% of liver transplants in children. We also initiated a pivotal trial for Bylvay as a treatment for ALGS, the ASSERT trial, in the fourth quarter of 2020 and expect topline results from that trial at the end of 2022. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to develop the capability to commercialize Bylvay to treat orphan pediatric liver diseases through a targeted sales force in the United States and certain key markets in Europe and in collaboration with licensees and distribution partners in selected other regions. Having received marketing approval in the United States, the European Union and Great Britain for Bylvay to treat patients with PFIC, we have been building the capabilities to effectively commercialize Bylvay in the approved indication(s) in the applicable regions. The commercial organization remains modest in size in order to target the relatively small number of specialists in the United States, Europe and other markets who treat children with cholestatic liver disease. We have entered into select collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to obtain marketing authorizations and commercialize Bylvay in the approved indication(s) in Israel, Turkey, the GCC countries, Central and Eastern European countries and Japan. We continue to assess potential collaboration partners in other key markets. We have entered into a fee for service promotional agreement with Travere Therapeutics, Inc. for promotional support for Bylvay in the United States. The initial term of the arrangement is two years from launch of Bylvay, terminable at will by either party after one year following launch.

● | Collaborate selectively to develop and commercialize product candidates targeting nonorphan indications, potentially including any future product candidate to treat adult liver diseases. We intend to selectively seek alliances and collaborations to assist us in furthering the development or commercialization of product candidates targeting large primary care markets that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations. These product candidates may include A3907, A2342 and any potential future product candidate that arises from our preclinical program in adult liver diseases.

Our Pipeline

Bylvay
Bylvay (odevixibat) was approved by the FDA on July 20, 2021 for the treatment of pruritis in patients ages 3 months or older with PFIC, and authorized by the EMA on July 16, 2021 for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. Bylvay was also granted marketing authorization by the MHRA on September 7, 2021 for the treatment of patients 6 months or older with PFIC. Bylvay is available in the U.S. and became available by prescription to patients in Germany in September 2021. PEDFIC 2, our ongoing long term, open label extension study to evaluate long-term outcomes, includes a cohort of patients who completed 24 weeks in PEDFIC 1 or moved into PEDFIC 2 after 12 weeks in PEDFIC 1, as well as an additional cohort of PFIC patients who were not eligible for PEDFIC 1. In addition to PFIC, we initiated a pivotal clinical trial in biliary atresia in the first half of 2020 and a pivotal trial for Bylvay as a treatment for ALGS in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Bylvay is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of IBAT that is designed to reduce bile acid reabsorption from the small intestine to the liver, and therefore reduce levels of bile acids in the serum and liver and increase excretion of bile acids via the colon. We believe that reducing liver and serum bile acid levels may reduce bile acid-related liver damage to improve liver function and alleviate symptoms of PFIC and other cholestatic liver diseases, including pruritus. Moreover, at therapeutic doses, Bylvay has minimal systemic exposure, acts locally in the gut and, based on preclinical testing, appears to be excreted substantially intact in the feces, which may reduce the risk of systemic side effects and undesirable drug-drug interactions compared with drugs that have broad distribution in the body. Odevixibat has been granted orphan drug designation for PFIC, PBC, biliary atresia and ALGS in the United States and the European Union. 
Approved Indication for Bylvay
PFIC. Bylvay is approved for the treatment of pruritus in PFIC in the U.S. and for PFIC in Europe. PFIC is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive, life-threatening liver disease, which may start early after birth or at a young age and rapidly progress to end-stage liver disease. PFIC is commonly associated with elevated serum bile acids. Prominent symptoms of PFIC include pruritus, which is associated with severe sleep disturbance and diminished overall quality of life, and poor growth. Prior to the approval of Bylvay, first-line treatment in PFIC was typically off-label UDCA, which is approved in France only for PFIC type 3. UDCA is itself a type of bile acid that is thought to act by diluting the toxic effects in the liver and bile ducts of a different type of bile acids, known as hydrophobic bile acids, which are often elevated in cholestatic liver disease. Third-party retrospective analyses published in 2009 and 2010 indicate that, following treatment with UDCA, many PFIC patients require PEBD surgery and PFIC patients will often ultimately require liver transplantation. Although success rates vary, published third-party studies have shown that PEBD surgery can slow and, in some cases, stop the progression of liver disease and lead to reduced pruritus and improved sleep. We 

9



believe these outcomes validate our approach of reducing liver and serum bile acids with an IBAT inhibitor such as Bylvay to treat PFIC.
​
The precise prevalence of PFIC is unknown, and we are not aware of any patient registries or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients with PFIC in any geography. PFIC has been estimated to affect between one in every 75,000 children born worldwide. Based on the published incidence, published regional populations, and estimated median life expectancies, we estimate the prevalence of PFIC across the spectrum of the disease to be approximately 15,000 patients worldwide, not including China and India, but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of PFIC with precision. We hold global rights to Bylvay. Our current plan is to commercialize Bylvay ourselves in the United States and certain key markets in Europe. We have entered into select collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize Bylvay in the approved indication(s) in Israel, Turkey, the GCC countries, Central and Eastern European countries and Japan. We continue to assess potential collaboration partners in other key markets. 
PFIC, type 1, which is sometimes referred to as “Byler disease” or “FIC1 deficiency,” is caused by impaired bile secretion due to mutations in the ATP8B1 gene that result in an imbalance of molecules known as phospholipids that is associated with cholestasis and elevated bile acids in the liver. Children affected by PFIC, type 1 usually develop cholestasis in the first months of life and, in the absence of surgical treatment, progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease before the end of the first decade of life. PFIC, type 1 is especially common in the Old Order Amish population in the United States, as well as the Inuit population of Greenland.

● | PFIC, type 2, which is sometimes referred to as “Byler syndrome” or “BSEP deficiency,” is caused by impaired bile salt secretion due to mutations in the ABCB11 gene that result in the buildup of bile salts in liver cells. Children with PFIC, type 2 often develop liver failure within the first few years of life and are at increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common form of liver cancer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PFIC, type 3, which typically presents in the first years of childhood with progressive cholestasis, is caused by mutations in the ABCB4 gene. Mutations in the ABCB4 gene lead to a lack of phospholipids available to bind to bile acids, resulting in a buildup of bile acids that damages liver cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TJP2 gene, NR1H4 gene or Myo5b gene mutations have also been proposed to be causes of PFIC. In addition, some patients with PFIC do not have a mutation in any of the ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, TJP2, NR1H4 or Myo5b genes. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.
Biliary Atresia Indication for Bylvay
Biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is a partial or total blocking or absence of large bile ducts that irreversibly prevents bile flow from the liver to the small intestine, causing cholestasis and resulting accumulation of bile that damages the liver. The damage leads to scarring, loss of liver tissue and cirrhosis, which makes it difficult for the liver to remove toxins from the blood and deteriorates the liver. Biliary atresia is life threatening.
There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of biliary atresia. The current standard of care is the Kasai procedure. The chance of a successful Kasai procedure is highest if performed before a patient is two months of age. However, even with early intervention, scarring of the liver can continue, resulting in cirrhosis and eventually the need for transplantation. Only an estimated 25% of those initially undergoing the Kasai procedure will survive to their twenties without need for liver transplantation.
The estimated worldwide incidence of biliary atresia is between 6 and 10 for every 100,000 live births. Of all biliary atresia patients, we believe Bylvay will primarily benefit those who have undergone a Kasai procedure that has been sufficiently successful to obviate the need for liver transplant within the first year of life. We estimate the prevalence of biliary atresia to be approximately 18,000 patients across the U.S. and Europe, and 27,000 combined in other jurisdictions worldwide, but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of biliary atresia with precision. 

10



The exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown, but it is thought to result from an event in the womb around the time of birth. Possible triggers may include viral or bacterial infection, an immune system malfunction, a genetic mutation, a problem during liver or bile duct development or exposure to toxic substances. In January 2019, the FDA granted orphan designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia. The European Commission granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia in December of 2018.  We initiated the BOLD clinical trial, a global pivotal trial in biliary atresia, in the first half of 2020. Our double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal trial is designed to enroll approximately 200 patients at 70 sites globally. Patients will receive either placebo or 120µg/kg Bylvay odevixibat once daily. The primary endpoint is survival with native liver after two years of treatment. At the end of 2021, we had enrolled over 50% of the targeted patients in the trial. We anticipate having topline results available from this trial in 2024.
ALGS. ALGS is a genetic condition associated with liver, heart, eye, kidney and skeletal abnormalities. In particular, ALGS patients have fewer than normal bile ducts inside the liver, which leads to cholestasis and the accumulation of bile and causes scarring in the liver. Symptoms include jaundice, pruritus, poor growth and specific facial features and typically develop in the first two years of life.
We estimate the prevalence of ALGS to be approximately 12,000 patients across the U.S. and Europe, and approximately 13,000 combined in other jurisdictions worldwide, but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of ALGS with precision.
The estimated worldwide incidence of ALGS is one in every 50,000 newborns born worldwide. ALGS is predominately caused by mutations in a gene called Jagged1. In a small number of cases, ALGS results from mutations in a gene called Notch2. In October 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we initiated the ASSERT global pivotal trial for Bylvay as a treatment for ALGS. We expect topline data to be available by the end of 2022, before the announcement of the topline results from the BOLD clinical trial.
Potential Additional Target Indications for Bylvay
Primary Sclerosing cholangitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis refers to swelling (inflammation), scarring, and destruction of bile ducts inside and outside of the liver. The first symptoms are typically fatigue, itching and jaundice, and many patients with sclerosing cholangitis also suffer from inflammatory bowel disease. The estimated incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 9 cases per 100,000 people. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of sclerosing cholangitis. First-line treatment is typically off-label UDCA, although UDCA has not been established to be safe and effective in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis in well controlled clinical trials.
Long Term Extension Study for Bylvay in PFIC
PEDFIC 2, our long term, open label extension study, includes a cohort of patients who completed 24 weeks in PEDFIC 1 or moved into PEDFIC 2 after 12 weeks in PEDFIC 1, as well as an additional cohort of PFIC patients who were not eligible for PEDFIC 1. Patients in PEDFIC 2 receive Bylvay 120 µg/kg once per day over 72 weeks. Primary outcome measures in PEDFIC 2 are change in pruritus as indexed by caregiver reported observed scratching using our proprietary PRUCISION instrument, and change in sBAs, in each case from baseline over 72 weeks. Interim data from 69 patients through 24 weeks of treatment in PEDFIC 2 was presented at the November 2020 AASLD. The interim results show that the reductions in sBAs and/or pruritus observed in patients receiving Bylvay in PEDFIC 1 was maintained or increased during continued Bylvay treatment in PEDFIC 2. For patients who were treatment naïve to Bylvay (patients who received placebo in PEDFIC 1 or patients who enrolled directly into PEDFIC 2), reductions in sBAs and pruritus were similar to those observed during Bylvay treatment in PEDFIC 1.  Continued treatment with Bylvay in PEDFIC 2 resulted in increased growth rates and catch-up growth in children with PFIC.  
At the November 2021 AASLD, we presented data from an additional interim data cut as of December 4, 2020. The data showed continued long term clinical benefit across PFIC types. Overall, 84 patients received Bylvay during the pooled analysis period, and the overall median (range) exposure from the first dose of Bylvay was 53 (3−128) weeks. 

11



sBA responders had larger improvements in pruritus than sBA non-responders or partial responders as defined by those who did not meet sBA response criteria. Approximately 40% of patients met criteria for sBA response (≥70% reduction in sBAs or sBAs ≤70 μmol/L) during Bylvay treatment. When treatment response was defined by sBA and/or pruritus criteria (≥70% reduction in sBAs or sBAs ≤70 μmol/L), approximately 60% of patients treated with Bylvay achieved a treatment response. In addition, there are a number of patients that are partial responders. We also presented additional evidence of Bylvay reducing disease burden and improving quality of life. From baseline to week 72, responders had mean improvement in hepatic health parameters in transaminases and total bilirubin levels, quality of sleep and growth, with greater improvement observed in responders compared with non-responders. The data showed benefit across PFIC types. During up to 54 weeks of Bylvay treatment, patients with PFIC3 (n=5) and PFIC6 (n=1) experienced clinical benefits, including reductions in sBAs and improvement in pruritus symptoms, growth and sleep parameters. The observed safety and tolerability profile of Bylvay was consistent across studies, treatment groups and doses, regardless of PFIC classification or subtype. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported in either PEDFIC 1 or PEDFIC 2 at the time of the interim data cut.
Elobixibat
Our product candidate elobixibat is licensed for the treatment of chronic constipation and other functional diseases in Japan and other select markets in Asia to EA Pharma. In January 2018, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, approved a new drug application filed by EA Pharma for elobixibat for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan. EA Pharma co-markets elobixibat in Japan with another company, Mochida, and co-promotes elobixibat with Eisai in Japan under the trade name GOOFICE®.
We have commercial rights to elobixibat in the United States, Europe and all other territories not licensed to EA Pharma. We do not have any current plan to seek a license or other partnering transaction with a third party for elobixibat for chronic constipation in the United States and Europe. Whether or not we elect to seek such a transaction, we do not anticipate that we will conduct future clinical trials of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic constipation independently.
Elobixibat is, like Bylvay, an IBAT inhibitor. In August 2020, we announced topline results from our Phase 2 clinical trial as a treatment for NAFLD and NASH and based on the results of the trial, we decided not to pursue further development of elobixibat in NAFLD or NASH. 
Clinical Development and Clinical Trials of Elobixibat
Prior to Albireo Limited’s inception in 2008, elobixibat was evaluated by its predecessor owner, AstraZeneca, in various preclinical studies and Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trials. In Phase 1 clinical development, elobixibat was generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers and showed minimal systemic exposure. Subsequently, we conducted a two-year nonclinical carcinogenicity toxicology study that did not result in any findings of concern and we or our former licensee conducted various additional Phase 1 and early Phase 2 clinical trials to assess the pharmacokinetics and various effects of elobixibat. Findings from these studies indicated, among other things, favorable effects of elobixibat on colonic transit and on low-density lipoprotein, or LDL or “bad” cholesterol.
In 2010, we completed a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, in the United States.
The primary endpoint of the trial was change in number of weekly spontaneous bowel movement, or SBMs from baseline to the first treatment week for patients who received one of three doses of elobixibat (5, 10 or 15 mg) compared with patients who received a placebo. The results demonstrated a dose response in favor of elobixibat among all three dose groups and were statistically significant in the 10 mg (p < 0.002) and 15 mg (p < 0.001) dose groups.
Secondary efficacy endpoints of the trial included evaluations of changes in mean weekly number of SBMs and complete spontaneous bowel movements, or CSBMs, time to first SBM or CSBM, overall constipation response and 

12



reduction in C4 and LDL cholesterol levels. The 10 mg and 15 mg elobixibat doses met all of these secondary endpoints with statistical significance.
All doses of elobixibat were generally well tolerated in the clinical trial. 
In 2015 our licensee, EA Pharma, completed a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic constipation in Japan. 
The primary endpoint of the trial was change in number of weekly SBMs from baseline to the first treatment week for patients who received low, mid or high doses of elobixibat compared with patients who received a placebo. In the trial, both the mid and high dose groups of elobixibat showed a highly statistically significant advantage on change from baseline in weekly SBM frequency compared with placebo (p < 0.001). The findings in favor of elobixibat were substantially the same on a secondary endpoint of the trial assessing change from baseline in weekly CSBM frequency.
All doses of elobixibat were generally well tolerated in the trial, and no SAEs were reported. 
In October 2016, we announced positive results from a Phase 3 clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic constipation conducted by EA Pharma in Japan. The trial was a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled trial in which patients with chronic constipation received a fixed dose of elobixibat or placebo once daily for two weeks. In the trial, elobixibat met the primary endpoint, which was change in the number of weekly SBMs from baseline to the first treatment week compared with placebo, with high statistical significance. Elobixibat also met all secondary efficacy endpoints in the trial assessed statistically, including assessments of change in frequency of CSBMs, time to first SBM, severity of constipation and stool consistency, with high statistical significance.
There were no SAEs reported in the trial. 
Two Phase 3 clinical trials conducted by a former licensee of ours to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elobixibat as a treatment for CIC, known as Echo 1 and Echo 2, ended in 2014. Our former licensee stopped Echo 1 and Echo 2 early citing an issue related to the distribution of study drug to study sites that was unrelated to the performance of elobixibat. Subsequent analysis by our former licensee determined the issue to have affected only Echo 2 and a small number of patients. As a result of the early termination of the trials, each of Echo 1 and Echo 2 enrolled substantially fewer than the number of patients contemplated by the trial’s statistical plan. A third Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by our former licensee to evaluate the long-term safety of elobixibat, known as Echo 3, ended in 2015.
In 2019 we initiated a double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of elobixibat 5 mg in NASH/NAFLD patients over 16 weeks, as measured by liver steatosis and various biomarkers. Based on the results of the trial, we decided not to pursue further development of elobixibat in NAFLD or NASH.
A3907
Our lead candidate for adult liver diseases, A3907, is a selective inhibitor of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) where systemic bioavailability has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. As a result, A3907 has the potential to not only affect the bile acid pool by increased bile acid excretion in the stools but also through other pathways, including increased urinary bile acid excretion. This unique approach may yield greater dosing flexibility, greater efficacy and lower rates of adverse events associated with the category, such as diarrhea, in adult patients with liver diseases. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy subjects. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial by the end of 2022.
Phase 1 Trial
In November 2021, we announced topline data from a Phase 1 trial of A3907. The Phase 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and seven-day multiple-dose study was conducted in 54 and 22, respectively, healthy subjects. Doses evaluated were 1-162 mg in the single ascending dose portion, and 9-67.5 mg in the multiple 

13



ascending dose portion. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability, secondary objectives were evaluation of pharmacokinetics, and there were multiple exploratory endpoints.
The study met its primary objectives with data showing A3907 overall to be safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). All TEAEs were mild, the most common were mainly abdominal symptoms such as loose stools, and all participants finished the trial protocol. No clinically significant effects in clinical chemistry, hematology, physical examinations or ECG. The study also met its secondary objectives with dose-related plasma exposure up to 81 mg dose, with no accumulation. Exposure levels were within the range that show effects in animal disease models. Single doses of A3907 showed dose proportional increases in plasma exposure up to 81 mg with no further increase at a dose of 162 mg. The study showed target engagement with 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) increases and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions, with C4 increases indicating elevation in bile acid excretion, while LDL-C reduction indicating elevated synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol.
Preclinical Programs
​
A2342
Our lead preclinical candidate for adult viral and liver diseases, A2342, is an oral systemic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting peptide, or NTCP inhibitor, which is a potent small molecule that blocks entry of bile acids into the liver. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 study with A2342 by the end of 2022.  Preclinical efforts with other bile acid modulator approaches continue.
License and Royalty Monetization Agreements
Agreement with EA Pharma
We entered into a license agreement with EA Pharma (formerly known as Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.) for the development and commercialization of elobixibat in specified countries in Asia in April 2012. 
Pursuant to the agreement, we granted EA Pharma an exclusive license under patents and other technology owned or licensed by us to develop and commercialize elobixibat in Japan and certain Asian Pacific markets for all prophylactic or therapeutic uses of a pharmaceutical product for specified GI diseases and disorders, symptoms of constipation of all causes, or postoperative ileus or for use in colonoscopy cleansing procedures. The agreement also provides that the scope of the license may be expanded to include specified liver diseases, if we or an affiliate or licensee takes specified development actions outside of EA Pharma’s licensed territory with elobixibat in that specified liver disease, or files an application for regulatory approval of elobixibat outside of EA Pharma’s licensed territory for that specified liver disease, or otherwise approves that EA Pharma conduct a clinical trial in that specified liver disease.
Payment Terms. As of February 15, 2022, we have received $49.9 million in upfront and milestone payments from EA Pharma under the agreement. We are eligible to receive additional amounts of up to $4.9 million if a specified regulatory event is achieved for elobixibat. In addition, subject to the terms of the royalty interest acquisition agreement, or RIAA, with HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCR, described below, we may become eligible under the license agreement to receive up to $17.4 million if specified sales milestones are achieved for elobixibat and we also receive stepped royalties beginning in the high single digits on all future net sales of elobixibat. 
EA Pharma’s obligation under the license agreement to pay royalties for elobixibat expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of expiration of the patent rights in a country that have a specified scope and that we either licensed to EA Pharma or, subject to a specified term limit, are developed by EA Pharma, alone or together with us, in the course of its activities under the agreement or expiration of regulatory exclusivity for elobixibat in that country. The Japanese patent rights with respect to elobixibat that we licensed to EA Pharma expire between 2026 and 2029. In addition, we have two pending patent applications on specific crystal polymorphs of elobixibat that, if issued in Japan, will expire in 2034 and 2035, respectively. Royalty rates are subject to reduction under the agreement in specified 

14



circumstances, including in any country if elobixibat is subject to generic competition that exceeds a specified level, if the bulk price for unformulated elobixibat purchased from us for use in Japan exceeds a specified threshold or if EA Pharma licenses patent rights from any third party under circumstances where it is legally required to do so to commercialize elobixibat in its licensed field in a particular country in its licensed territory.
Development and Commercialization. EA Pharma is responsible for funding and using commercially reasonable efforts to execute the development and commercialization of elobixibat in its licensed field and licensed territory pursuant to agreed territory development and commercialization plans that are updated from time to time. In Japan, EA Pharma co-markets elobixibat with Mochida pursuant to a sublicense agreement and co-promotes elobixibat with Eisai. A joint development committee and a joint commercialization committee, each comprising representatives of each company, oversees activities under the agreement.
EA Pharma is responsible for commercial manufacture and supply of elobixibat in its licensed territory.
Restrictions. EA Pharma is not permitted to conduct clinical development or commercialize elobixibat outside of its licensed field of use or licensed territory. We are not permitted to commercialize elobixibat for any field of use in EA Pharma’s licensed territory. In addition, if we determine to develop elobixibat in a liver disease outside of EA Pharma’s licensed territory, our development is subject to specified restrictions on clinical trial design. After the first commercial sale of elobixibat in any country in EA Pharma’s licensed field, neither we nor EA Pharma may commercialize a different product for the treatment of chronic constipation or IBS-C in that country, subject to specified exceptions.
Term and Termination. Either we or EA Pharma can terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis if the other party materially breaches the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period. Also, either we or EA Pharma can terminate the agreement in its entirety if a specified bankruptcy-related event with regard to the other party occurs. EA Pharma also has the right to terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis (except for Japan) for any reason upon 180 days’ notice. The rights and obligations of the parties that survive termination of the agreement vary depending on the basis for the termination.
Royalty Monetization Agreement with HCR
In December 2017, the Company entered into a royalty interest acquisition agreement (RIAA) with HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P. (HCR) pursuant to which it sold to HCR the right to receive all royalties from sales in Japan and sales milestones achieved from any covered territory potentially payable to the Company under the Agreement, up to a specified maximum “cap” amount of $78.8 million, based on the funds the Company received from HCR. In January 2018, the Company received $44.5 million from HCR, net of certain transaction expenses, under the RIAA. On June 8, 2020, the parties entered into an amendment to the RIAA pursuant to which HCR agreed to pay the Company an additional $14.8 million, net of certain transactions expenses, in exchange for the elimination of the (i) $78.8 million cap amount on HCR’s rights to receive royalties on sales in Japan and sales milestones for elobixibat in certain other territories that may become payable by EA Pharma and (ii) the $15.0 million payable to the Company if a specified sales milestone is achieved for elobixibat in Japan. The Company is obligated to make royalty interest payments to HCR under the RIAA only to the extent it receives future Japanese royalties, sales milestones or other specified payments from EA Pharma. Although the Company sold its rights to receive royalties from the sales of elobixibat in Japan, as a result of its ongoing involvement in the cash flows related to these royalties, the Company will continue to account for these royalties as revenue. Upon receipt of the payments from HCR the Company recorded net cash totaling $59.3 million as a liability related to sale of future royalties (royalty obligation). The royalty obligation will be amortized using the effective interest rate method.
The RIAA requires us to take certain actions with respect to the elobixibat royalties and sales milestones and with respect to our license agreement with EA Pharma and contains certain representations and warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations and other provisions that are customary for a royalty monetization transaction. In addition, for protective purposes only, we (specifically, Albireo Pharma, Inc., Albireo AB and Elobix AB) have agreed to grant HCR a precautionary security interest in specified assets related to elobixibat, but only in the event that, notwithstanding 

15



the parties’ intentions, the transfer contemplated by the RIAA is held by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a true sale.
We record estimated royalties due for the current period in accrued other expenses until the payment is received from EA Pharma at which time we then remit payment to HCR. In order to determine the accretion of the royalty obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received and submitted to HCR. The sum of these amounts less the $59.3 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the royalty obligation. At December 31, 2021, our estimate of our total interest expense resulted in an annual effective interest rate of approximately 18.1%.
Terminated License Agreement with Ferring International Center S.A.
We entered into a license agreement with Ferring International Center S.A., or Ferring, for the development and commercialization of elobixibat outside of the territories licensed to EA Pharma in July 2012, following completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of elobixibat to treat CIC. In March 2015, Ferring terminated the agreement, effective in September 2015. As a result of the termination of the agreement, all licenses that we granted to Ferring under the license agreement terminated and commercial rights to elobixibat in Ferring’s licensed territory reverted to us. In addition, Ferring was required, among other things, to assign to us all rights to all regulatory submissions and approvals controlled by Ferring pertaining to elobixibat in the licensed territory and to grant to us an exclusive right of reference to data, and specified licenses to data and technology, related to elobixibat for the development and commercialization of elobixibat in its licensed field. Notwithstanding the termination of the license agreement, Ferring may be entitled to low single-digit royalty payments on net sales of elobixibat on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis in specified circumstances. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including compositions and forms and their methods of use in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets. We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
As of December 31, 2021, our patent estate included 37 issued patents, 4 allowed applications and 17 pending patent applications in the United States and approximately 50 counterpart patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions, including 11 European regional issued patents and 9 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications which allow us to seek corresponding patent protection worldwide. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in a particular jurisdiction.

16



We consider the following United States, European (EP) and, in the case of elobixibat, Japanese (JP) patents to be particularly important to the protection of our commercial products and pre-clinical- and clinical-stage product candidates.

We also have issued patents and pending patent applications with equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
Seven of our patents that cover compositions of matter and methods of using Bylvay have been listed in the FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.”
Except when specifically indicated, the patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension (PTE) that we may receive for the United States under The United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, or similar patent term extension legislation in Europe and Japan. The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of FDA approval. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA. Typically, only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for an extension, and, with limited exceptions, the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
In the European Economic Area (EEA; the European Union member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 generally permits an extension of the patent term for a drug as compensation for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or the national drug agencies. Similar extensions are available in Great Britain and Switzerland. The term of a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, corresponds to the period between the filing date of the patent and the date of the first Marketing Authorization, reduced by a period of 5 years. An SPC may extend the patent term for an approved drug up to five years, but the remaining patent term may not exceed 15 years from the date of the first Marketing Authorization. Only one patent that covers the approved drug is eligible for an SPC. Applications for an SPC are reviewed and approved by the national patent offices, and must be lodged within six months of the authorization date for the drug in each country (or within six months of the grant of the patent, in case the Marketing Authorization is granted first).
In Japan, the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law generally permits the extension of the patent term for a drug as compensation for patent term lost during the regulatory review process by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The patent term extension corresponds to the period from the date of the start of clinical trials or the date of patent registration, whichever is later, until one day prior to the date of approval for the drug. The term of a patent can be extended for up to five years, irrespective of the remaining natural term of the patent as of the date of approval. Each patent that covers the active ingredient in the approved drug, or a method of using the approved drug in the approved indication, is eligible for the extension, which means that, for any particular drug, multiple patents may be extended. The extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within three months from the date of approval. The Japanese Patent Office reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
Sales and Marketing 
Following approval of Bylvay by the FDA, EMA and MHRA, we have built a sales and distribution organization that we believe will be necessary to effectively support the commercialization of Bylvay in the United States, and Europe. We believe that our commercial organization can be modest in size and targeted to the relatively small number of specialists in the United States, Europe and other markets who treat children with orphan cholestatic liver disease. We plan to continue to expand this to other key international markets where Bylvay may be approved for PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder. In addition to our Chief Commercial Officer, we have hired a President of U.S and a President of International, and continue to build sales and account teams in both jurisdictions. We have also hired employees in Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and France who will support the commercialization of Bylvay ex-US. We have entered into a fee for service promotional agreement with Travere Therapeutics, Inc. for promotional support for Bylvay in the United States. The initial term of the arrangement is two years from launch of Bylvay, terminable at will by either party after one year following launch.

18



We have entered into select collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to apply for marketing authorizations and commercialize Bylvay in the approved indication(s) in Israel, Turkey, the GCC countries, Central Eastern European countries and Japan. We continue to assess potential collaboration partners in other key markets.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of odevixibat, elobixibat, A3907, A2342 or any of our other product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and any products that we may develop.
We currently engage a single third-party manufacturer to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for odevixibat and our product candidates, A3907 and A2342. We also currently engage single third-party manufacturers to produce the final drug product formulation of each of Bylvay, A3907 and A2342 for use in our clinical trials.
We obtain the supplies of our API and drug products from these manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines, quality and volume expectations. We obtain the supplies of our product candidates from these manufacturers under master services contracts and specific work orders. However, we do not have long-term supply arrangements in place for our product candidates. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for API for any of odevixibat, elobixibat, A3907 or A2342. If any of our current manufacturers becomes unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we would likely incur significant delay in identifying and qualifying such replacements. 
Odevixibat, elobixibat, A3907 and A2342 are organic compounds of low molecular weight, and are referred to as “small molecules.” We have selected these compounds based on their potential efficacy and safety, although they are also associated with reasonable cost of goods. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with larger or more established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.

19



The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, tolerability, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
The competition in our target indications includes the following.
PFIC and other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. For many cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, there are no approved therapies. Bylvay is the first drug treatment approved for patients with PFIC. 
Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s IBAT inhibitor, LIVMARLI (maralixibat) was approved by the FDA for treatment of cholestatic pruritis in patients one year of age or older with ALGS on September 29, 2021. Mirum also submitted a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease in patients with ALGS to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and announced that it expects potential approval in the second half of 2022. Mirum is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in PFIC and disclosed that it expects to announce topline data in the second half of 2022. Additionally, Mirum is conducting a Phase 2 trial for maralixibat in biliary atresia and disclosed that it expects to announce topline data from that trial in 2023. Mirum is also conducting Phase 2 trials of its IBAT inhibitor, volixibat, in primary sclerosing cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and PBC. GlaxoSmithKline is conducting a Phase 3 trial of linerixibat for the treatment of cholestatic pruritis in patients with PBC. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to linerixibat for the treatment of PBC in September 2019.
A number of other drugs, including UDCA, a bile acid which is approved in France only for PFIC type 3, rifampin, an antibiotic derivative, and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, are used off-label for patients suffering from cholestatic liver disease. Additionally, surgical interventions, such as PEBD surgery, and external liver filtering procedures are also employed in an attempt to lower bile acid levels, manage pruritus and improve measures of liver function.
In addition, Intercept Pharmaceuticals’ OCALIVA (obeticholic acid), is approved in the U.S. in combination with UDCA, or as a monotherapy for patients unable to tolerate UDCA, to treat PBC. OCALIVA is also in Phase 2 development at Intercept as a treatment for biliary atresia. In July 2019, Genfit SA received orphan designations from the FDA and EMA for its PPAR alpha/delta agonist, (elafibranor), for the treatment of PBC. Genfit is conducting a Phase 3 trial for elafibranor in PBC. CymaBay Therapeutics initiated a Phase 3 study (RESPONSE) in early 2021 for Seladelpar for the treatment of PBC. Seladelpar has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (FDA) and PRIME status (EMEA); Orphan Drug Designation in U.S. and Europe. Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s FXR agonist, cilofexor, is in Phase 3 development for PSC.
Human Capital
As of February 15, 2022, we employed 130 full-time employees, of whom 32 hold Ph.D., M.D., or Pharm.D. degrees, or the foreign equivalent. Of these employees, 66 were engaged in research and development and 31 were engaged in general and administrative functions and 33 were engaged in commercial activities. Our headquarters are in Boston, MA, and we have an office in the UK and a research site in Gothenburg Sweden. Our employees in Sweden are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be positive. We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2022, with a focus on further expanding our geographic reach as we continue the global launches of Bylvay.
The Company recognizes that our industry is specialized and dynamic, and a significant aspect of our success is our continued ability to execute our human capital strategy of attracting, engaging, developing and retaining highly skilled talent. There is fierce competition both within our industry and in the geographic locations in which we have offices for highly skilled talent, and we offer a robust set of benefits, career-enhancing learning experiences and initiatives aligned with our mission, vision, and values in order to attract qualified prospective employees and to retain and motivate our employees. We offer competitive compensation for our employees and strongly embrace a pay for performance philosophy in setting and adjusting compensation. 
​

20



Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics clearly outlines our unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion, where all employees are welcomed in an environment designed to make them feel comfortable, respected, and accepted regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation. We have a set of policies explicitly setting forth our expectations for nondiscrimination and a harassment-free work environment. We are also a proud equal opportunity employer and cultivate a highly collaborative and entrepreneurial culture.
​
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, the approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21




● | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or API and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can be initiated or restarted (in cases when the trial is placed on clinical hold after it has already begun).
In addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to clinical trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition, in order to be tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, in order to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in one or more well-controlled clinical trials in order to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the drug, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if SAEs occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other clinical trials or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol or GCP or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Submission of an NDA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, which requests approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the fee for the submission of an NDA for which clinical data is required exceeds $3.1million for FY2022, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $369,000 per program. These fees are typically increased annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances (such as a waiver for the first human drug application submitted by a qualifying small business and exemptions for orphan products).
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date the NDA is accepted for filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months from the date the NDA is accepted for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the drug product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS.  REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS are tailored to the specific risk/benefit profile of a drug and can include requirements such as medication guides for patients, detailed communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, restricted distribution, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS as a condition of approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS and the specific components that are involved can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.

23



The FDA often refers an application for a new drug to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making final approval decisions about a particular NDA.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
Specifically, the FDA may grant a product the fast track designation if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track product application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory program for products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to designated breakthrough therapies, including: holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments and based upon a demonstration that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the 

24



availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher
The FDA may grant rare pediatric disease designation for indications in the treatment or prevention of a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and that is a serious or life-threatening disease that primarily affects individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children and adolescents. The FDA granted us a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, or PRV following the approval of Bylvay for the treatment of pruritis in PFIC in July 2021. We subsequently sold the PRV for $105.0 million. A PRV can be redeemed to receive priority review under an expedited timeframe for a subsequent marketing application for a different product. A PRV may also be sold or transferred from the initial sponsor to another sponsor and may be further transferred any number of times before it is used. The United States Congress recently extended the FDA’s authority to award rare pediatric disease PRVs until 2024 and until 2026 for products that receive rare pediatric disease designation by 2024.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information and for specific indications. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to the CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

25



If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product; require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling; require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval; require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization; or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured, marketed or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and related establishments, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and others involved in the manufacturing process. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant penalties.

26



In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of nonpatent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of nonpatent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years after the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant also is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Specifically, the applicant for a follow-on drug product must certify with respect to each patent that:

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------

27




● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval).
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA owner and patent holders once the ANDA in question has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA owner and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
Pediatric Clinical Trials and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trial or trials the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of nonpatent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the nonpatent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS, biliary atresia and PBC, and the approved product Bylvay has been granted a period of orphan drug exclusivity as a result of having been designated as an orphan drug for the treatment of PFIC prior to its U.S. marketing approval in July 2021. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or 

28



condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the designation request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or approved medical device may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided that certain statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. For drugs, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension, and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, provided that statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Regulation Outside the United States
In order to market any product candidate outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product candidate, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Regulation and Marketing Authorization in the European Union
Clinical Trial Approval
Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are implemented in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of an E.U. member state in which a trial is planned to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a 

29



clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.
In April 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 was enacted to replace Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, and it became effective on January 31, 2022. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the new E.U. Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on the date the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable and the duration of each individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from January 31, 2022, then the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to it.
The new Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include:

● | a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned and Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial application; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Regulation (EU) No 536/2014.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRIME Designation
The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, grants access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program to investigational medicines for which it determines there to be preliminary data available showing the potential to address an unmet medical need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. As part of the program, EMA provides early and enhanced dialogue and support to optimize the development of eligible medicines and speed up their evaluation, aiming to bring promising treatments to patients sooner. The EMA has granted access to the PRIME program at the “proof of concept” stage for Bylvay to treat PFIC.
Marketing Authorization
Authorization to market a product in the member states of the European Union proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure.
Centralized Authorization Procedure
The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all E.U. member states based on a single application. Certain medicinal products, including products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must undergo the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization, which, if granted by the European Commission, is automatically valid in all 28 E.U. member states. The EMA and the European Commission administer this centralized authorization procedure pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

30



Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, this procedure is mandatory for various types of products, including, among others, products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000.
The centralized authorization procedure is optional for other medicinal products if they contain a new active substance or if the applicant shows that the medicinal product concerned constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization is in the interest of patients in the European Union.
Administrative Procedure
Under the centralized authorization procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products for human use on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s national authority for medicinal products, with an expert appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the CHMP acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP has 210 days to adopt an opinion as to whether a marketing authorization should be granted. The process usually takes longer in case additional information is requested, which triggers clock-stops in the procedural timelines. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug that is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may pursuant to Article 14(9) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time-limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time-limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report, or EPAR, is produced. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the MAA must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the E.U. member states, which in total can take more than 60 days.
Conditional Approval
In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
Marketing Authorization under Exceptional Circumstances
Under Article 14(8) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, products for which the applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data (in line with the requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended) cannot be provided (due to specific reasons foreseen in the legislation) might be eligible for marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. This type of authorization is reviewed annually to reassess the risk-benefit balance. The fulfillment of any specific procedures/obligations imposed as part of the marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is aimed at the provision of information on the safe and effective use of the product and will normally not 

31



lead to the completion of a full dossier/approval. Bylvay received a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances.
Market Authorizations Granted by Authorities of E.U. Member States
In general, if the centralized procedure is not followed, there are three alternative procedures as prescribed in Directive 2001/83/EC:

● | The decentralized procedure allows applicants to file identical applications to several E.U. member states and receive simultaneous national approvals based on the recognition by E.U. member states of an assessment by a reference member state.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The national procedure is only available for products intended to be authorized in a single E.U. member state.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A mutual recognition procedure similar to the decentralized procedure is available when a marketing authorization has already been obtained in at least one E.U. member state.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union.
Pediatric Studies
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
In 2017, the PDCO agreed to our PIP for Bylvay as a treatment for PFIC.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
The European Commission, following an evaluation by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, has designated odevixibat as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PFIC, as well as for the treatment of PBC and ALGS. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, the European Commission can grant such orphan medicinal product designation to products for which the sponsor can establish that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, or a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would generate a sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In addition, the sponsor must establish that there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients.
Orphan drug designation is not a marketing authorization. It is a designation that provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized E.U. marketing authorization, as well as ten years of market exclusivity following marketing authorization of the designated orphan drug. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA, the European Commission nor the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as those contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product and that is intended for the same therapeutic indication. A “similar active substance” is defined as an active substance that is identical or has the same principal molecular structural features (but not necessarily all of the same molecular features) and acts via the same mechanism as the authorized orphan medicinal product. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the already approved orphan drug. Furthermore, a product can lose orphan designation and the related benefits, prior to us having obtained a marketing authorization, if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met.
Regulatory Data Protection
E.U. legislation also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder, or MAH, obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials. However, products designated as orphan medicinal products enjoy, upon receiving marketing authorization, a period of ten years of orphan market exclusivity—see also “Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity.” Depending upon the timing and duration of the E.U. marketing authorization process, products may be eligible for up to five years’ supplementary protection certificates, or SPCs, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009. Such SPCs extend the rights under the basic patent for the drug.

Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
We are required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products:
Pharmacovigilance and Other Requirements
The E.U. has stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate, for example, to the manufacturing of products and APIs in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. E.U. regulators may conduct inspections to verify our compliance with applicable requirements, and we will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Noncompliance with E.U. requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, or requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the European Union. Similarly, failure to comply with the E.U.’s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual E.U. member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of authorized drugs, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s cGMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. The EMA enforces its cGMP requirements through mandatory registration of facilities and inspections of those facilities. The EMA may have a coordinating role for these inspections although the responsibility for carrying them out rests with the member states’ competent authority under whose responsibility the manufacturer falls. Failure to comply with these requirements could interrupt supply and result in delays, unanticipated costs and lost revenues, and could subject the applicant to potential legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil and criminal penalties.
Marketing and Promotion
The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83/EC. The applicable regulations aim to ensure that information provided by holders of marketing authorizations regarding their products is truthful, balanced and accurately reflects the safety and efficacy claims authorized by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Patent Term Extension
In order to compensate the patentee for delays in obtaining a marketing authorization for a patented product, an SPC may be granted extending the exclusivity period for that specific product by up to five years. Applications for SPCs must be made to the relevant patent office in each E.U. member state and the granted certificates are valid only in the member state of grant. An application has to be made by the patent owner within six months of the first marketing authorization being granted in the European Union (assuming the patent in question has not expired, lapsed or been revoked) or within six months of the grant of the patent (if the marketing authorization is granted first). In the context of SPCs, the term “product” means the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients for a medicinal product and the term “patent” means a patent protecting such a product or a new manufacturing process or application for it. The duration of an SPC is calculated as the difference between the patent’s filing date and the date of the first marketing authorization, minus five years, subject to a maximum term of five years.

34



A six month pediatric extension of an SPC may be obtained where the patentee has carried out an agreed pediatric investigation plan, the authorized product information includes information on the results of the studies and the product is authorized in all member states of the European Union.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of products approved by the FDA will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
Other Healthcare Law and Regulation
As we are commercializing Bylvay and may commercialize other product candidates, if approved, we are subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by federal government and the states and foreign governments in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of Bylvay and any other product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial 

35



arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval.
Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;

● | the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
