Background
 
The Providence Service Corporation is a holding company which owns interests in subsidiaries and other companies that are primarily engaged in the provision of healthcare and workforce development services for public and private sector entities seeking to control costs and promote positive outcomes. The subsidiaries and other companies in which we hold interests comprise the following segments: 

● | Non-Emergency Transportation Services (“NET Services”) – Nationwide provider of non-emergency medical transportation (“NET”) programs for state governments and managed care organizations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Workforce Development Services (“WD Services”) – Global provider of employment preparation and placement and legal offender rehabilitation services to eligible participants of government sponsored programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Matrix Investment – Minority interest in nationwide provider of in-home care optimization and management solutions, including comprehensive health assessments (“CHAs”), to members of managed care organizations, accounted for as an equity method investment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ingeus UK Holdings Limited and its wholly and partly-owned subsidiaries and associates (collectively, “Ingeus”), which make up the majority of WD Services, were acquired on May 30, 2014. On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our Human Services segment (the “Human Services Sale”), which is accounted for as a discontinued operation.

Matrix Investment is comprised of our interest in Mercury Parent, LLC, a newly formed parent of CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. CCHN Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries are referred to as “Matrix”. Matrix was acquired by the Company on October 23, 2014. On October 19, 2016, affiliates of Frazier Healthcare Partners purchased a 53.2% equity interest in Matrix, with Providence retaining a 46.8% equity interest (the “Matrix Transaction”). Prior to the closing of the Matrix Transaction, the financial results of Matrix were included in our Health Assessment Services (“HA Services”) segment. The Company now owns a noncontrolling interest in Matrix. The Company’s proportionate share of Matrix’s net assets and financial results for the period following the closing of the Matrix Transaction are presented under the equity method. The assets, liabilities and financial results of Matrix for the period prior to the closing of the Matrix Transaction are presented within discontinued operations. For additional information regarding the Matrix Transaction, see Note 21, Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements.
 
As of December 31, 2016, NET Services and WD Services operated in 40 states and the District of Columbia in the United States (“U.S.”), and in 9 countries outside of the U.S.
 
The Company is a Delaware corporation formed in 1996 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.
 
Business Strategies
 
While our segments report into our holding company management team, each is managed in a decentralized manner and pursues strategies reflective of their respective industries and operating models. 
 
 Our holding company strategy is designed to increase shareholder value through a focus on building intrinsic value on a per share basis, which in turn is predicated upon the growth, continuous improvement and efficient delivery of high quality, technology-enabled services within our segments. In order to successfully pursue our strategies, our priorities at the holding company level include: 1) pursuing the highest standards of governance, values and compliance, 2) ensuring operating excellence by attracting, developing, and retaining empowered and accountable segment level leadership with significant industry experience, and 3) allocating capital opportunistically in markets that may be inefficient or where we have an ability to invest at a discount to intrinsic value, particularly where our experience, analysis, and long-term perspective can provide an advantage over competitors. As demonstrated in 2016 with the Matrix Transaction and in 2015 with the Human Services Sale, we also may enter into strategic partnerships or dispose of current or future segments, based on a variety of factors, including availability of alternative opportunities to deploy capital or otherwise maximize shareholder value as well as other strategic considerations. While infrequent, we may also pursue acquisitions and investments in industries not served by our existing segments. 
 
Our strategic priorities and service offerings are based upon a common purpose of delivering exceptional value in the healthcare and workforce development industries, primarily through technology-enabled service platforms. Our segments seek to deliver disciplined and industry leading sales growth (excluding the impact of acquisitions) and generate industry-leading margins, cash flow and returns on capital. To accomplish these goals, we continuously improve our offerings in the areas of quality, cost and innovation through multiple operational levers. We pursue both organic and inorganic growth through entry into adjacent markets and complementary service lines, particularly with offerings that may leverage the advantages inherent in our large-scale networks. Our segments’ core competencies include developing and managing large provider networks, tailoring healthcare and workforce development service offerings to the unique needs of diverse communities and populations, and implementing technology-enabled delivery models to achieve superior outcomes in low cost settings. 
    Holding Company Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting strategic opportunities, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having similar business objectives, such as strategic investors, private equity groups and special purpose acquisition corporations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and executing transactions directly or through affiliates. These competitors may possess greater human and other resources than us, and our financial resources may be relatively limited in comparison. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in contrast to our competitors.
Financial Information About our Segments
 
The Company operates in two principal business segments, NET Services and WD Services. In addition, Providence holds a noncontrolling interest in Matrix, which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes, Matrix Investment. Financial information about segments and geographic areas, including revenues, operating income (loss), and long-lived assets of each segment, is included in Note 22, Segments, to our consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our operations and investments.

Our Segments
 
NET Services
 
Services offered. NET Services provides non-emergency transportation solutions to clients in 39 states and the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 26.1 million individuals were eligible to receive our transportation services, and during 2016, NET Services managed 69.0 million trips. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, NET Services accounted for 78.2%, 73.3% and 80.9%, respectively, of Providence’s consolidated revenue.
 
  
NET Services primarily contracts with state Medicaid programs and managed care organizations (“MCOs” and collectively “NET customers”) for the coordination of their members’ (“NET end-users”) non-emergency transportation needs. NET end-users are typically Medicaid or Medicare eligible members, whose limited mobility or financial resources would otherwise hinder their ability to access necessary healthcare and social services. We believe our transportation services enable access to care that not only improves the quality of life and health of the populations we serve, but also enables many of the individuals we serve to pursue independent living in their homes rather than in more expensive institutional care settings.
 
Our programs are dependent upon our highly-integrated technology platform and the management of a multifaceted network of transportation providers. Our technology platform is integrated with our network constituents and purpose-built for the unique needs of our industry. Our platform is highly scalable and can support substantial growth in our current membership base. Our platform provides for broad interconnectivity between NET end users, transportation providers and our clients, and, we believe, uniquely positions us as a future focal point in the evolving healthcare industry to introduce additional population insights. In 2016, we introduced new technological features for NET end users to improve service levels, lower costs and build the foundation for additional data analytics capabilities. 
 
To fulfill the transportation needs of NET end-users, we apply our proprietary technology platform to an extensive system of approximately 5,500 transportation resources. This includes our in-network roster of fully contracted transportation providers who operate sedans, wheelchair equipped vehicles, multi-passenger vans and ambulances. Our system also utilizes partnerships with mass transit entities, mileage reimbursement programs and taxis. To promote safety, quality, and compliance, our in-network transportation providers undergo an in-depth credentialing and education process. In 2016, we introduced additional sources of transportation capacity, including on-demand transportation systems in certain markets, to increase our service levels and lower costs. Through these additional sources of transportation, we may use integrated solutions using our proprietary technology platform and our external partners’ application program interfaces to improve on-time and on-demand performance, provide real time information and analytics, minimize cancellations and better allow for the scale required to provide an effective, nationwide service.
 
Revenue and customers. In 2016, contracts with state Medicaid agencies and MCOs represented 58.9% and 41.1%, respectively, of NET Services’ revenue. NET Services derived 13.1%, 15.0% and 17.0% of its revenue from a single Medicaid agency for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The next four largest NET Services customers in the aggregate comprised 22.6%, 24.2% and 26.2% of NET Services’ revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 
Contracts with state Medicaid agencies are typically for three to five years with multiple renewal options. Contracts with MCOs are typically of indefinite duration until terminated by either party upon reasonable notice (as determined in accordance with the contract), and allow for regular price adjustments based upon utilization and transportation cost. On average, approximately 20% of the total revenue generated by NET Services under state Medicaid contracts is subject to renewal within the next 12 months, although this percentage can be much higher, as certain contracts represent a significant portion of revenue. As of December 31, 2016, 33.8% of NET Services revenue was generated under state Medicaid contracts that were subject to renewal within the next 12 months, which includes our contract with the state of New Jersey, which represented 13.1% of NET Services’ revenue in 2016.
    78.3% of NET Services’ revenue in 2016 was generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the covered healthcare related transportation requirements of a specific population. Capitated contracts are generally structured with fixed per-member, per-month payment rates. The remainder of the revenue was generated under other types of fee arrangements, including administrative services only, fee for service (“FFS”), cost plus and flat fee contracts, under which fees are generated based upon billing rates for specific services or defined membership populations.
 
Seasonality. While revenue is generally fixed, primarily as a result of the capitated nature of the majority of our contracts, service expense varies based on the utilization of our services. The quarterly operating income and cash flows of NET Services normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in the business, principally due to lower transportation demand during the winter season and higher demand during the summer season. 
 
Competition. We compete with a variety of regional organizations that provide similar healthcare and social services related transportation, such as American Medical Response, Inc., Medical Transportation Management Inc., SoutheasTrans, Inc. and Veyo LLC, as well as local and regional providers. Most local competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties or small geographic territories whereas we and other larger competitors seek to win contracts for an entire state or large regional area. We compete based upon a number of factors, including our nationwide network, technical expertise, experience, service capability, and price.

   Business development. Our sales and marketing strategy relies on a concentrated business development effort, with centralized marketing programs. Due to the critical nature of our services, our customers rely upon our past delivery performance record, network development and management expertise, technical expertise and specialized knowledge. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from long-term, repeat customers. Our long-term strategy is to improve our position as the preferred provider of transportation, complementary network-based services and data analytics offerings to both state Medicaid agencies and MCOs. Key elements of our long-term strategy include continued investment in our technologies, enabling us to both lower costs and improve service delivery. We also consider opportunistic acquisitions of businesses that serve our market or leverage our nationwide infrastructure, consistent with our stated holding company strategy. 
 
In 2016, we launched a strategic initiative to enhance member satisfaction and drive greater operational efficiencies. This initiative focuses on developing and deploying new processes and technologies needed to progress towards an industry-leading call center and reservation scheduling platform; improve member communication, accessibility, and satisfaction; optimize the utilization of our extensive network of transportation providers; and build the foundation for additional analytical capabilities. The implementation of the initiative is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2017. 
 
WD Services
 
Services offered. WD Services provides workforce development and legal reoffender rehabilitation services, which include employment preparation and placement, apprenticeship and training, youth community service programs and certain health related services. For 2016, 2015 and 2014, WD Services accounted for 21.8%, 26.7% and 19.1%, respectively, of Providence’s consolidated revenue. 
 
WD Services’ end user client base (“WD end-users”) is broad and includes both the recently and long-term unemployed, disabled, and individuals seeking new skills, as well as individuals that are coping with medical illnesses, are newly graduated from educational institutions, or have been recently released from incarceration.
 
  As of December 31, 2016, WD Services operated in 10 countries, including the United Kingdom (“UK”), Australia, France, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Canada, the U.S., Germany, Spain and Switzerland. We expect to launch operations in Singapore in 2017. Operations in Sweden and Poland ceased during 2016. 
 
Revenue, customers and clients. The majority of WD Services’ revenue is generated through the provision of employability and training programs to national government entities seeking to reduce unemployment or recidivism rates. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 68.3%, 75.5% and 66.6%, respectively, of WD Services’ revenue was derived from operations in the UK. Additionally, 28.9%, 40.0% and 57.2% of WD Services’ revenue was derived from a contract with the UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 25.9% and 28.2% of WD Services’ revenue was derived from a contract with the UK government’s Ministry of Justice.
    The revenue earned by WD Services under its contracts is often derived through a combination of different revenue channels including, but not limited to, fees contingent upon: (1) the volume of WD end-users referred to and/or admitted into a specific program, (2) the achievement of defined outcomes for specific individuals, such as a job placement or continued employment and (3) the achievement of defined outcomes for a population of individuals over a specific time period, such as aggregate employment or recidivism rates. The relative contributions of different revenue channels under a specific contract can fluctuate meaningfully over the life of a contract and thus contribute to significant earnings volatility. In particular, revenue recognition related to our National Citizen Services (“NCS”) youth programs can be particularly volatile due to the nature of the payment cycle and services provided. WD Services also earns revenue under fixed FFS arrangements, based upon contractual rates established at the outset of the contract or the applicable contract year, although the rate may be prospectively adjusted during the contract year based upon actual volumes. Volume levels are typically not guaranteed under contracts.   
 
The nature of the services offered by WD Services often relies on our ability to improve a certain set of outcomes at a reduced cost versus previously utilized in-sourced delivery models. As a result, as we commence new contracts using transformational delivery models, we are required to invest significant upfront capital for information technology, human resources, facilities and other onboarding costs, such as consultants and redundancy payments. The level of upfront funding required is dependent upon the size and nature of the contract. Although significant upfront funding may be required, revenues are often payable only as services are delivered and, in some cases, only after incentive measures have been achieved over a multi-year period. As a result of these two factors, there can be significant variability in our earnings from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. In addition, under the majority of WD Services’ contracts, the Company relies on its customers, which include government agencies, to provide referrals, for whom the Company can provide services and earn revenue. The timing and magnitude of referrals can fluctuate significantly, leading to volatility in revenue. As a result, we often measure a contracts success over the entire term of the contract and believe the financial results of WD Services are best viewed over a multi-year perspective.

  Seasonality. While there has been period-to-period variability in WD Services’ earnings due to the factors discussed above and also set forth in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Revenues and Expenses – WD Services”, there has not been a material seasonal effect on WD Services’ results of operations.
 
Competition. In the UK, Australia and Saudi Arabia, the workforce development market is served by large multi-national corporations and regional for-profit and non-profit entities. In Canada, France, Germany, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the U.S., our competition primarily consists of small, privately owned companies. In the UK, the offender rehabilitation market is served by large corporations, often working with charitable sector providers. Our larger competitors include Maximus, Capita, G4S, Sodexo, Interserve, Seetec, The Reed Group, Staffline and Serco.
 
The market for services to governments is competitive and subject to change and pricing pressure, particularly during the bidding for new contracts and contract renewals. However, due to the critical nature of our offerings and the WD end-users we serve, market entry can be difficult for new entrants or those without prior established track-records. Other barriers to entry include operational service complexity and significant upfront investments. This can include establishment of complex IT systems, significant monitoring and reporting obligations, delivery from sites across wide geographies, and management and development of supply chains.
    Business development. Our business development activities are performed both locally and centrally in WD Services’ London headquarters. Through local and global networks and relationships, we become aware of new opportunities for which we develop bids through competitive processes. The nature of the competitive processes varies from highly competitive to being one of a few providers, or the sole provider, to bid on a contract. In late 2015, our bidding process was overhauled with an improved focus on pursuing only those contracts that meet certain investment criteria, including risk-weighted return on capital thresholds, and involve the provision of services where we believe our experience will allow us to deliver differentiated and improved outcomes for our clients.
 
In 2016, in order to build upon its leadership position in the UK employment services industry, enhance client satisfaction and drive greater operational efficiencies, WD Services launched the Ingeus Futures program. This program includes organizational restructuring, the development and deployment of new processes and technologies, and increased business development resources. Each aspect is aimed at improving operational efficiencies and client services as well as developing the internal capabilities necessary to ensure long-term profitable growth in the employment, training and healthcare industries. The implementation of the initiative is expected to be substantially completed during 2017.
 
Matrix Investment
 
On October 19, 2016, the Company completed a stock subscription transaction, pursuant to which affiliates of Frazier Healthcare Partners (the “Frazier Subscriber”) purchased a 53.2% equity interest in Matrix with Providence retaining a 46.8% equity interest. On that same date, a subsidiary of the Company and the Frazier Subscriber entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “Operating Agreement”) of Mercury Parent, LLC, a newly formed company through which the parties hold their equity interests in Matrix. The Operating Agreement sets forth certain terms and conditions regarding the ownership by the Company and Frazier Subscriber of interests in Mercury Parent and their indirect ownership of common stock of Matrix, and provides for, among other things, certain liquidity and governance rights and other obligations and rights, in each case, on the terms and conditions contained therein.
 
Services offered. Matrix provides in-home care optimization and care management solutions, which include CHAs. Matrix utilizes a national network of over 1,100 nurse practitioners (“NPs”), located across 36 states, to provide its services primarily to members of Medicare Advantage (“MA”) health plans. 
 

Matrix primarily generates revenue from CHAs, which obtain a health plan members’ information related to health status, social, environmental and medical risks and help the MA plans improve the accuracy of such information. Matrix’s services typically commence with a member analysis that utilizes client data, such as medical claims data, to maximize its ability to improve client and member outcomes as a result of the assessment process. Through Matrix’s contact centers, which include almost 175 colleagues, Matrix pursues additional data collection and schedules assessments. Matrix’s NPs then spend approximately 60 minutes in the member’s home conducting a CHA, which is comprised of a physical examination and other diagnostic services.
     
8



Matrix’s services are dependent upon its technology platform which integrates the NP network, operations infrastructure, call centers and clients. Matrix’s purpose-built platform is designed for the unique needs of its industry, is highly scalable and can support substantial growth. We believe Matrix’s network and platform positions Matrix as a future focal point in the evolving healthcare industry in the introduction of both additional population insights and care management services. As a further step towards the provision of these additional data analytics and care management services, Matrix launched a chronic care management offering in 2015. With data provided by its health plan clients, Matrix utilizes analytics to determine for which members it can most effectively lower costs and improve outcomes through face-to-face engagements with clinicians. Each program is customized and is served by a comprehensive team of case managers, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and trained call center colleagues.

Revenue, customers and clients. As of December 31, 2016, Matrix’s customers included almost 40 health plans, including for-profit multi-state health plans and non-profit health plans that operate in only one state or several counties within one state. Matrix serves many of the largest and most prestigious health plans and health systems in the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Matrix’s top five customers accounted for 71.8% of its revenue, and its largest customer accounted for 27.8% of its revenue. Matrix enters into annual or multi-annual contracts with its customers under which it is paid on a per assessment basis.

Seasonality. Matrix has historically experienced higher CHA volume in the second half of the calendar year as a result of an accelerating demand towards calendar year-end. However, in 2016, CHAs were performed more evenly throughout the year as Matrix worked to balance volume to more efficiently utilize NP capacity.
 
Competition. We believe that Matrix and CenseoHealth are the largest independent providers of CHAs to the health plan market. There are many smaller competitors, including Advance Health, EMSI Healthcare Services, MedXM, and Inovalon, Inc. Some health plans in-source CHA services. Matrix’s chronic care management competitors include Landmark Healthcare, PopHealthcare and Optum.
 
Employees
 
In the execution of our holding company strategy, our holding company staff utilizes their experience in both public and private markets, previous operational leadership in a variety of industries, as well as other typical public holding company capabilities, including competencies in the areas of accounting, tax, human resources, information technology and legal. Our colleagues may also supplement our segment leadership teams in the areas of strategic development, operational and financial improvement, and cross segment sales or operational synergies on a selective basis.
 
As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 30 employees at our holding company. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 7,590 clinical, client service and administrative personnel. Of these employees, approximately 3,760 work in NET Services and approximately 3,830 work in WD Services.

None of our U.S. employees are members of a union. We have nearly 2,380 and 370 full-time employees in the UK and France, respectively. Certain of our UK employees are members of the NAPO and Unison unions and certain of our employees in France are members of the Confederation Generale du Travail. Unionized employees in both countries have collective bargaining rights. Participation in unions is confidential under European employment laws. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, both unionized and non-unionized, in the U.S. and internationally.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
Overview
 
Our segments are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and agency guidance (collectively, “Laws”). These Laws significantly affect the way in which our segments operate various aspects of their businesses. Our segments must also comply with state and local licensing requirements, state and federal requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid, requirements for contracting with MA plans, and contractual requirements imposed upon them by the federal, state and local agencies and third-party commercial customers to which they provide services. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our segments’ ability to be paid for the services they provide and be authorized to provide services on an ongoing basis.
 
In addition, our segments’ revenue is largely derived from contracts that are directly or indirectly paid or funded by government agencies, including Medicare and Medicaid. A significant decline in government expenditures for such programs, or shift of program parameters or funding, could cause customers to reduce their payments under those contracts or to not renew such contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our segments’ future operating results. As funding for our contracts is dependent in part upon federal funding, such funding changes could have a significant effect on our business.

The Medicare and Medicaid programs are governed by significant and complex federal Laws.  Because each of the Medicare and Medicaid is financed, at least in part, with federal funds, direct or indirect recipients of those funds are subject to federal fraud, waste and abuse Laws.  In addition, there are federal privacy and security Laws that govern the healthcare industry. State Laws primarily pertain to the licensure of certain categories of healthcare professionals and providers and the state’s interest in regulating the quality of healthcare in the state, regardless of the source of payment, but may also include state Laws pertaining to fraud, waste and abuse, privacy and security Laws, and the state’s regulation of its Medicaid program. Federal or state regulatory laws that may affect our segments’ businesses, include, but are not limited to the following:
 

● | false and other improper claims or false statements pertaining to reimbursement; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its privacy, security, breach notification and enforcement and code set regulations, along with evolving state laws protecting patient privacy and requiring notifications of unauthorized access to, or use of, patient medical information;
● | civil monetary penalties law; 
● | anti-kickback laws; 
● | the Stark Law and other self-referral and financial inducement laws; 
● | CMS regulations pertaining to Medicare as well as CMS releases applicable to the operation of MA plans, such as reimbursement rates, risk adjustment and data collection methodologies, adjustments to quality management measurements and other relevant factors; and 
● | state licensure laws. 

 
A violation of certain of these Laws could result in civil and criminal penalties, the refund of monies paid by government or private payers, our segments’ exclusion from participation in federal healthcare payer programs, or the loss of our segments’ license to conduct business within a particular state’s boundaries. Although our segments believe that they are able to maintain material compliance with all applicable Laws, these Laws are complex and a review of our segments’ practices by a court, or applicable law enforcement or regulatory authority, could result in an adverse determination that could harm our segments’ businesses. Furthermore, the Laws applicable to our segments’ businesses are subject to change, interpretation and amendment, which could adversely affect our segments’ ability to conduct our business.
 
Federal Law
 
Federal healthcare laws apply in any case in which our segments are providing an item or service that is reimbursable or provide information to our segments’ customers that results in reimbursement by a federal healthcare payer program to our segments or them. The principal federal Laws that affect our segments’ businesses include those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims or other data with federal healthcare payer programs and those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federal healthcare payer programs.
False and Other Improper Claims
 
Under the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733) and similar state Laws, the government may impose civil liability on our segments if they knowingly submit, or participate in submitting, any claims for payment to the federal or state government that are false or fraudulent, or that contain false or misleading information. The False Claims Act defines a claim as a demand for money or property made directly to the government or to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient if the money is to be spent on the government’s behalf or if the government will reimburse the contractor or grantee. Liability can be incurred for submitting (or causing another to submit) false claims with actual knowledge or for submitting false claims with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance. Liability can also be incurred for knowingly making or using a false record or statement to receive payment from the federal government or for knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. Consequently, a provider need not take an affirmative action to conceal or avoid an obligation to the government, but the mere retention of an overpayment from the government could lead to potential liability under the False Claims Act.
 
 
10



If our segments are ever found to have violated the False Claims Act, they could be required to make significant payments to the government (including damages and penalties in addition to the return of reimbursements previously collected) and could be excluded from participating in federal healthcare programs or providing services to entities which contract with those programs. Many states also have similar false claims statutes. In addition, healthcare fraud is a priority of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”), its program integrity contractors and its Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and state Attorneys General. These agencies have devoted a significant amount of resources to investigating healthcare fraud.
    While the criminal statutes generally are reserved for instances evidencing fraudulent intent, the civil and administrative penalty statutes are being applied by the federal government in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. Examples of the types of activities giving rise to liability for filing false claims include billing for services not rendered, misrepresenting services rendered (i.e., miscoding), applications for duplicate reimbursement and providing false information that results in reimbursement or impacts reimbursement amounts. Additionally, the federal government takes the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant should have known that the services were unnecessary. The federal government also takes the position that claiming reimbursement for services that are substandard is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care was substandard. Criminal penalties also are available even in the case of claims filed with private insurers if the federal government shows that the claims constitute mail fraud or wire fraud or violate any of the federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes.
 
State Medicaid agencies and state Attorneys General also have authority to seek criminal or civil sanctions for fraud and abuse violations. In addition, private insurers may bring actions under state false claim laws. In certain circumstances, federal and state laws authorize private whistleblowers to bring false claim or “qui tam” suits on behalf of the government against providers and reward the whistleblower with a portion of any final recovery. In addition, the federal government has engaged a number of private audit organizations to assist it in tracking and recovering claims for healthcare services that may have been improperly submitted.
 
Governmental investigations and whistleblower “qui tam” suits against healthcare companies have increased significantly in recent years, and have resulted in substantial penalties and fines and exclusions of persons and entities from participating in government healthcare programs. Although our segments monitor their billing practices for compliance with applicable laws, such laws are very complex, and they might not be able to detect all errors or interpret such laws in a manner consistent with a court or an agency’s interpretation.
 
Health information practices
 
Under HIPAA, DHHS issued rules to define and implement standards for the electronic transactions and code sets for the submission of transactions such as claims, and privacy and security of individually identifiable health information in whatever manner it is maintained.
 
The Final Rule on Enforcement of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions, including the transaction standards, the security standards and the privacy rule, published by DHHS addresses, among other issues, DHHS’s policies for determining violations and calculating civil monetary penalties, how DHHS will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and various procedural issues. The rule extends enforcement provisions currently applicable to the healthcare privacy regulations to other HIPAA standards, including security, transactions and the appropriate use of service code sets.
 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, extends certain of HIPAA’s obligations to parties providing services to healthcare entities covered by HIPAA known as “business associates,” imposes new notice of privacy breach reporting obligations, extends enforcement powers to state attorney generals and amends the HIPAA privacy and security laws to strengthen the civil and criminal enforcement of HIPAA. HITECH establishes four categories of violations that reflect increasing levels of culpability, four corresponding tiers of penalty amounts that significantly increase the minimum penalty amount for each violation, and a maximum penalty amount of $1.5 million for all violations of an identical provision. With the additional HIPAA enforcement power under HITECH, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services and states are increasing their investigations and enforcement of HIPAA compliance. Our segments have taken steps to ensure compliance with HIPAA and we are monitoring compliance on an ongoing basis.
 
Additionally, the HITECH Final Rule imposes various requirements on covered entities and business associates, and expands the definition of “business associates” to cover contractors of business associates. Even when our segments are not operating as covered entities, they may be deemed to be “business associates” for HIPAA rule purposes of such covered entities. Our segments monitor their compliance obligations under HIPAA as modified by HITECH, and implement operational and systems changes, associate training and education, conduct risk assessments and allocate resources as needed. Any noncompliance with HIPPA requirements could expose our segments to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under HITECH and require them to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements or to remediate potential issues that may arise.

Federal and state anti-kickback laws
 
Federal law commonly known as the “Anti-Kickback Statute” prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value (direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind) which is intended to induce: the referral of an individual for a service for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs; or the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any service or item for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal healthcare programs.
 
Interpretations of the Anti-Kickback Statute have been very broad and under current Law, courts and federal regulatory authorities have stated that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if even one purpose (as opposed to the sole or primary purpose) of the arrangement is to induce referrals. Even bona fide investment interests in a healthcare provider may be questioned under the Anti-Kickback Statute if the government concludes that the opportunity to invest was offered as an inducement for referrals.
 
This act is subject to numerous statutory and regulatory “safe harbors.” Compliance with the requirements of a safe harbor offers defenses against Anti-Kickback Statute allegations. Failure of an arrangement to satisfy all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement is unlawful. However, it may mean that such an arrangement will be subject to scrutiny by the regulatory authorities.
 
While our segments believe that their operations are in compliance with applicable Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse laws, there can be no guarantee. Our segments seek to structure all applicable arrangements to comply with applicable safe harbors where possible. There is a risk however, that the federal government might investigate such arrangements and conclude they violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. If our segments’ arrangements are found to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, our segments, along with their clients would be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which may include exclusion from participation in government reimbursement programs, and our segments’ arrangements would not be legally enforceable, which could materially and adversely affect their business.
 
Many states, including some where our segments do business, have adopted anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state laws are very closely patterned on the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; others, however, are broader and reach reimbursement by private payers. If our segments’ activities were deemed to be inconsistent with state anti-kickback or illegal remuneration laws, they could face civil and criminal penalties or be barred from such activities, any of which could harm our segments’ businesses.
 
Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions
 
Our segments may be subject to federal and state statutes banning payments for referrals of patients and referrals by physicians to healthcare providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship. Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the “Stark Law”, prohibits physicians from making a “referral” for “designated health services” for Medicare (and in many cases Medicaid) patients from entities or facilities in which such physicians directly or indirectly hold a “financial relationship”.
 
A financial relationship can take the form of a direct or indirect ownership, investment or compensation arrangement. A referral includes the request by a physician for, or ordering of, or the certifying or recertifying the need for, any designated health services.
 
Certain services that our segments provide may be identified as “designated health services” for purposes of the Stark Law. Our segments cannot provide assurance that future regulatory changes will not result in other services our segments provide becoming subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment or compensation prohibitions in the future.
 
Many states, including some states where our segments do business, have adopted similar or broader prohibitions against payments that are intended to induce referrals of clients. Moreover, many states where our segments operate have laws similar to the Stark Law prohibiting physician self-referrals. While our segments believe that they are operating in compliance with the Stark Law, there can be no guarantee that violations will not occur.

Healthcare Reform
 
 On March 23, 2010, the President of the United States signed into law comprehensive health reform through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 11-148) (“PPACA”). On March 30, 2010, the President signed a reconciliation budget bill that included amendments to the PPACA (Pub. L. 11-152). These laws in combination form the “ACA” referred to herein. The changes to various aspects of the healthcare system in the ACA are far-reaching and include, among many others, substantial adjustments to Medicare reimbursement, establishment of individual mandates for healthcare coverage, extension of coverage to certain populations, expansion of Medicaid, restrictions on physician-owned hospitals, and increased efficiency and oversight provisions.
 
Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, while others will take effect later or will be phased in over time, ranging from a few months following approval to ten years. Due to the complexity of the ACA, it is likely that additional legislation will be considered and enacted. The ACA requires the promulgation of regulations that will likely have significant effects on the healthcare industry and third party payers. Thus, the healthcare industry and our operations may be subjected to significant new statutory and regulatory requirements and contractual terms and conditions, and consequently to structural and operational changes and challenges.
 
The ACA also implements significant changes to healthcare fraud and abuse laws that will intensify the risks and consequences of enforcement actions. These include expansion of the False Claims Act by: (a) narrowing the public disclosure bar; and (b) explicitly stating that violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute trigger false claims liability. In addition, the ACA lessens the intent requirements under the Anti-Kickback Statute to provide that a person may violate the statute without knowledge or specific intent. The ACA also provides new funding and expanded powers to investigate fraud, including through expansion of the Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program to Medicare Parts C and D and Medicaid and authorizing the suspension of Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud. Finally, the legislation creates enhanced penalties for noncompliance, including increased criminal penalties and expansion of administrative penalties under Medicare and Medicaid. Collectively, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our segments’ operations.
 
On January 20, 2017, U.S. President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order that directs federal agencies to take steps to ensure the government’s implementation of the ACA minimizes the burden on impacted parties (individuals, states, etc.). The underlying intent of the executive order is to take the first steps to repeal and replace the ACA. The executive order specifically instructs agencies to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay implementation of provisions” that place a “fiscal burden on any State” or that impose a “cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden” on stakeholders including patients, providers, and insurers. The order states that any changes should be made only to the extent "permitted by law" and should comply with the law governing administrative rule-making. The executive order does not, however, provide specifics on next steps or provisions that will be reexamined nor is it clear how the executive branch will be reconciled with Republican congressional efforts to repeal and replace the ACA or what portions of the ACA may continue in any replacement legislation. There are multiple pending legislative proposals to amend the ACA which, among other effects, could repeal all or parts of the ACA without replacing its extension of coverage to expansion populations and materially restructure the Medicaid and other government health care programs. 
 
Surveys and audits
 
Our segments’ programs are subject to periodic surveys by government authorities or their contractors to ensure compliance with various requirements. Regulators conducting periodic surveys often provide reports containing statements of deficiencies for alleged failures to comply with various regulatory requirements. In most cases, if a deficiency finding is made by a reviewing agency, our segments will work with the reviewing agency to agree upon the steps to be taken to bring our program into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In some cases, however, an agency may take a number of adverse actions against a program, including:
 

● | the imposition of fines or penalties or the recoupment of amounts paid; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | temporary suspension of admission of new clients to our program’s service; 
● | in extreme circumstances, exclusion from participation in Medicaid, Medicare or other programs;
● | revocation of our license; or 

 
 
13




● | contract termination.
--+----------------------

 
While our segments believe that our programs are in compliance with Medicare, Medicaid and other program certification requirements and state licensure requirements, failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse impact on our segments’ businesses and their ability to enter into contracts with other agencies to provide services.
 
Billing/claims reviews and audits
 
Agencies and other third-party commercial payers periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment medical reviews or other audits of our segments’ claims or other audits in conjunction with their obligations to comply with the requirements of Medicare or Medicaid. In order to conduct these reviews, payers request documentation from our segments and then review that documentation to determine compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the eligibility of clients to receive benefits, the appropriateness of the care provided to those clients, and the documentation of that care. Any determination that our segments have not complied with applicable rules and regulations could result in adjustment of payments or the incurrence of fines and penalties, or in situations of significant compliance failures review or non-renewal of related contracts.
 
Corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting
 
Some states in which our segments operate prohibit general business entities, such as our segments are, from “practicing medicine,” which definition varies from state to state and can include employing physicians, as well as engaging in fee-splitting arrangements with these healthcare providers. Among other things, our segments currently contract with and employ NPs to perform CHAs. We believe that our segments have structured their operations appropriately; however, they could be alleged or found to be in violation of some or all of these laws. If a state determines that some portion of our segments’ businesses violate these laws, it may seek to have our segments discontinue or restructure those portions of their operations or subject them to increased costs, penalties, fines, certain license requirements or other measures. Any determination that our segments have acted improperly in this regard may result in liability to them. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the professional may be considered void and unenforceable.
 
Professional licensure and other requirements
 
Many of our segments’ employees are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing the ethics and practice of their professions. For example, our mid-level practitioners (e.g., NPs) are subject to state laws requiring physician supervision and state laws governing mid-level scope of practice. As the use of mid-levels by physicians increases, state governing boards are implementing more robust regulations governing mid-levels and their scope of practice under physician supervision. Our segments’ ability to provide mid-level practitioner services may be restricted by the enactment of new state laws governing mid-level scope of practice and by state agency interpretations and enforcement of such existing laws. In addition, professionals who are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid as individual providers must not have been excluded from participation in government programs at any time. Our segments’ ability to provide services depends upon the ability of their personnel to meet individual licensure and other requirements and maintain such licensure in good standing.
 
International Regulation of WD Services
 
As a provider of workforce development services in multiple international jurisdictions, we are subject to numerous national and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way in which we operate various aspects of our business. We must also comply with contract-specific technical and infrastructure requirements. Failure to follow the rules and requirements of these programs can significantly affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide. In addition, our revenue is primarily derived from contracts that are funded by national governments that are seeking to reduce the overall unemployment rate, or improve job placement success for targeted cohorts, and the recidivism rate. Further, the revenue we receive from these contracts is typically tied to milestones that are largely uncontrolled by us. Such milestones include the job placement success of clients, duration and tenure of clients in jobs once they are placed, and various other market and industry factors including the overall unemployment rate. A significant decline in national and local government initiatives to provide funding for employment programs, or shift of expenditures or funding, could cause government sponsors to reduce their expenditures under those contracts or not renew such contracts, either of which could have a negative impact on our future operating results.

WD Services is also subject to the European Union’s and other countries’ data security and protection laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose broad obligations on the organizations which collects such data, as well as confer broad rights on individuals about whom such data is collected. These laws and regulations may also restrict the flow of information, including information about employees or service users, from this segment to the Company in the U.S. In certain instances, informed consent to the data transfer must be given by the affected employee or service user. Compliance with such laws and regulations may make it more difficult for the Company to gather data necessary to ensure the appropriate operation of its internal controls or to detect corruption resulting in the need for additional controls or increasing the Company’s costs to maintain appropriate controls. 
 
Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or prison sentences as well as significant adverse publicity.
 
Further, our international operations are subject to various U.S. and foreign statutes that prohibit bribery and corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK’s Bribery Act. These statutes generally require organizations to prohibit bribery by or for the organization and demand the implementation of systems to counter bribery, including risk management, training and guidance and the maintenance of adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices. The statutes also, among other things, prevent the provision of anything of value to government officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. In addition, many countries in which we operate have antitrust or competition regulations which, among other things, prohibit collusive tendering or bid-rigging behavior. Failure to comply with any of these statutes and regulations could result in fines or penalties, or in some cases prison sentences, and could result in significant adverse publicity.
