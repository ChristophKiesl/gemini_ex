ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
COMPANY HISTORY
 
Manhattan Scientifics, Inc. (the “Company” or “Manhattan Scientifics”), a Delaware corporation, was established on July 31, 1992 and has two operating wholly-owned subsidiaries: Metallicum, Inc., (“Metallicum”) and Imagion Biosystems, Inc. (f/k/a Senior Scientific LLC) (“Imagion”). Manhattan Scientifics is focused on technology transfer and commercialization of these transformative technologies. 
 
In June 2008, we acquired Metallicum and its licensed patented technology. We entered into a stock purchase agreement with Metallicum to acquire all of the outstanding capital in exchange for 15,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. An additional 15,000,000 shares of our common stock will be payable to Metallicum in the event of meeting certain milestones. At December 31, 2011, one milestone was met. Metallicum was granted an exclusive license by The Los Alamos National Laboratory on patents related to nanostructured metals. In September 2009, we entered into a technology transfer agreement and sale with Carpenter Technology Corporation, (“Carpenter”) wherein Carpenter was to fully develop, manufacture and market a new class of high strength metals. On February 11, 2015, the Company and Carpenter entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release pursuant to which the parties provided a full release of one another, Carpenter paid the Company $8,000,000, Carpenter transferred to the Company all intellectual and physical property that was part of the original agreement, Carpenter agreed to provide follow-on technical assistance and Carpenter provided a list of all customers and contacts.
 
On May 31, 2011, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization to acquire Senior Scientific. The total purchase price was 21,668,000 restricted shares of our common stock (less 7,667,000 shares previously issued pursuant to an option agreement). As a result of this acquisition, we own patented technologies that can use biosafe nanoparticles and sensitive magnetic sensors to detect and measure cancer cells in biopsies or in the human body with the potential to transform how cancer is detected and treated. On November 17, 2016, Senior Scientific merged with and into Imagion, a Nevada company. Following the merger, Imagion held all of the liabilities, obligations and assets of Senior Scientific and the Company continued as the sole equity holder of Imagion. On November 29, 2016, the Company announced a plan to have Imagion pursue an IPO and listing on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). During the two months ended February 28, 2017, Imagion raised a total of approximately $2.7 million from investors for 62 million shares of common stock. Manhattan Scientifics presently owns approximately 50.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Imagion.

TWO BUSINESSES EXIST WITHIN MANHATTAN SCIENTIFICS
 
Two nanotechnology businesses exist within Manhattan Scientifics Inc; both “units” are wholly-owned subsidiaries, both focused on nanotechnology applications in medicine.
 
The goal of the first business, Metallicum, is to demonstrate our business-model, a licensing model, given that we are an inventions commercialization company.
 
Manhattan’s second business is called Imagion, and is at the crossroads of biotechnology and nanotechnology.
 
Our novel bioimaging and nanomagnetic detection systems have been developed specifically to detect cancer and other diseases earlier and with higher specificity than is currently possible. We have developed proprietary hardware and software for the highly sensitive detection of nanomagnetic particles that can be linked to antibodies for the detection and treatment of cancer and other human diseases—all without the use of ionizing radiation or large magnetic fields.
 
Our novel technologies make possible the earlier detection of cancer in vivo, the ability to analyze biopsies with greater sensitivity and accuracy, the ability to monitor the therapeutic effectiveness of anticancer treatments—both in humans and in animal models—and allow us to detect cancer recurrence with significantly improved sensitivity. Please see: www.ImagionBiosystems.com
 
The technology was developed by Edward R. Flynn, PhD, founder and former chief scientist of Senior Scientific, which has merged with Imagion.
 

OUR DEVELOPMENT MODEL
 
Our goal has been to influence the future through the development of potentially life changing technologies. Our business model is to: (i) identify significant technologies, (ii) acquire them or the rights to them, (iii) secure the services of inventors, engineers or other staff who were instrumental in their creation, (iv) provide or contract for suitable work facilities, laboratories, and other aids where appropriate, (v) prototype the technologies to demonstrate "proof of principle" feasibility, (vi) secure patent and or other intellectual property protection, (vii) secure early customers for product trials where feasible and appropriate, and (viii) commercialize through licenses, sales or cooperative efforts with other manufacturing and distribution firms.
 
Since our technologies are still in their development phase, the need for operating and acquisition capital is a continuous concern requiring the ongoing efforts of our management. The Company’s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patents and license rights, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that patents issued to or licensed by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company.
 
We utilize the intellectual property sale/licensing model, and not a production model, though management is opportunistic and is open to explore all methods leading to commercializing our technologies. We intend to consider all appropriate avenues for the commercialization of our technologies.
 
DESCRIPTION OF TECHNOLOGIES
 
ADVANCED METALS
 
Our business model is based on licensing metals technology to metals manufacturers. Although competing commercial products are provided by existing specialty metals companies, the only competing processes for creating nanostructured metals are either limited or cannot be economically scaled. Metallicum does not yet face direct competition, but expects competition will emerge as the metal is commercialized.
 
In January 2009, we entered into a patent license agreement with Los Alamos National Security, LLC for the exclusive licensing use of certain technology relating to the manufacture and application of nanostructuring metals and alloys. Pursuant to such agreement we provided a non-refundable fee and 2,000,000 shares of our common stock with a fair market value of $33,000. Additionally, we are required to pay an annual license fee of $10,000 starting in February 2010 and royalties on future net sales.

The technology goal is to expected to trim thousands of pounds from airplanes and hundreds of pounds from cars without sacrificing structural strength or adding significant cost. The nanostructured metals also have wide implications for use in the medical device and prosthetics industries including dental implants, replacements for hips, shoulders, knees and cardio vascular stents. In December 2008, a manufacturing joint venture partner in Albuquerque, NM received U.S. Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance to market nanostructured titanium metal dental implants using our technology. This clearance positions us closer to our goal of commercializing our technology for nanostructured metals. We are in talks with many of the key manufacturers of dental implants and have signed material testing agreements with several manufacturers.
 
In September 2009, the Company entered into a contract with Carpenter to sell certain nanostructured metal technologies acquired from Metallicum, its wholly owned subsidiary, to Carpenter and to provide sub-license rights to Carpenter covering license agreements that the Company has from Los Alamos Laboratories. In January 2013, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with a party granting certain licensing rights to the Company's nanostructured metal technology. On February 11, 2015, the Company and Carpenter entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release pursuant to which the parties provided a full release of one another, Carpenter paid the Company $8,000,000, Carpenter transferred to the Company all intellectual and physical property that was part of the original agreement, Carpenter agreed to provide follow-on technical assistance and Carpenter provided a list of all customers and contacts. Following the return of the Company’s nanostructured metal technology, the Company has commenced exploring strategic alternatives for its Metallicum division. At this time we are exploring and working with partner companies in the fields of titanium dental implants, titanium and magnesium medical devices, high voltage aluminum conductors as well as oil and gas field applications.
 
NANOMEDICINE
 
Our subsidiary, Imagion, holds patented technologies that can use biosafe nanoparticles and sensitive magnetic sensors to detect and measure cancer cells in biopsies or in the human body. The technology is specific – i.e. it measures a particular type of cancer and does not generate false positive results from benign growths, calcifications, or other spurious signals that complicate current detection methods. It is also very sensitive – it can measure tumors that are 1000-times smaller than is possible with currently available techniques. This combination of features has the potential to transform how cancer is detected and treated.
 
We have invested approximately $7.5 million in the Imagion cancer project in the past three years. We continue to progress in advancing the technology toward commercialization. 
 
We have implemented a nanoparticle production facility. Our magnetic relaxometry measurements are now performed with our own nanoparticles, and we have begun commercial sales of our nanoparticles to others.
 


· | Senior Scientific has joined both BIOCOM and NMBio as a corporate member, improving our access to and visibility within the general biopharmaceutical and New Mexico biotechnology communities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | In early 2015 we hired a new President with senior managerial expertise in medical product commercialization and direct experience in cancer diagnostics. Additionally, in February 2016 we hired a Vice President of R&D with direct experience in developing nanoparticles for targeted delivery to cancer. 
· | We are continuing to fund the development a version of our technology using atomic magnetometer technology, which was originally funded by an NIH grant. We believe the atomic magnetometer-based instrument will improve performance and create larger market opportunities for this technology relative to our current SQUID-based platform.

 
We expect to undertake the safety and toxicology studies necessary to show that our nanoparticles are safe for use in humans. Significant effort will be required to document the laboratory and manufacturing processes for nanoparticle production that the FDA are likely to require.
 
We believe that the constituent parts of the targeted nanoparticles have already been approved for injection in humans in other applications. Initial toxicology studies in cell cultures suggest that the combination of the parts into targeted nanoparticles is not toxic. 
 
All of these programs are designed to validate our technology for the market, which will produce value for our shareholders. Our technology makes possible the detection of specific cancer cells. Physicians may then select a broad range for initial diagnosis, or a single type for monitoring therapy or detecting metastases. Small quantities of biosafe nanoparticles with attached targeting agents are introduced into the patient where they “stick” only to the targeted cancer cells. A weak magnetic field is applied to magnetize the particles, and sensitive magnetic detectors count the number of particles that have stuck to cancer cells. Due to the highly specialized nature of both the nanoparticles and our detection device, only those particles stuck to their targeted cells are detected, making the results highly specific, objective (the results depend only on the cells, not a human interpretation of an image), and sensitive (only a few thousand cells are required, instead of hundreds of millions for conventional techniques).
 
Our technology makes possible improvements across a wide range of cancer fighting areas: detection of cancers years earlier; noninvasive, specific diagnosis after conventional screening; earlier, faster discovery of drugs; precise, personalized monitoring of therapy; detection of metastases while still treatable; and accurate monitoring of new therapies. Our technology has been proven in animal models using human cancer cells, in human trials using bone marrow biopsy samples, and is the subject of over 20 patent applications and14 peer-reviewed publications. Our success will depend in part on its ability to obtain regulatory approvals required for human application of its technologies, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY / RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
In 2008, we purchased Metallicum to acquire its licensed rights to patented technology. The technology is comprised of three US Patents (US Patent numbers 7152448, 6197129 and 6399215) for which Metallicum (subsequently, Manhattan) had been assigned an exclusive license rights by Los Alamos National Security LLC (LANL). Under the license rights, Metallicum had all rights, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, know-how, and improvements on the patents or trade secrets whether or not patentable or registerable under copyright or similar laws. The purchase price paid for these licenses was $305,000, which represents its fair value. The Company obtained an exclusive license on two patents and a non-exclusive license on the third patent. The value attributable to license agreements is being amortized over the period of its estimated benefit period of 10 years.
 
On May 31, 2011, we acquired Senior Scientific, which subsequently merged with Imagion, and all of its intellectual property. Incident to the acquisition, we assigned certain of the intellectual property to Scientific Nanomedicine, Inc., a subsidiary formed solely for that purpose. The need for that subsidiary has passed, and we have assigned all the intellectual property to Senior Scientific, which merged with Imagion. Imagion’s. Senior Scientific’s patent estate includes the patents and applications in the following schedule. We continue to prosecute our patent applications and file new applications as the technology progresses.

Our ability to compete depends in part on the protection of and our ability to defend our proprietary technology and on the goodwill associated with our trade names, service marks and other proprietary rights. However, we do not know if current laws will provide us with sufficient enough protection that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to ours, or that third parties will not copy or otherwise obtain or use our technologies without our authorization.
 
The success of our business will depend, in part, to identify technology, obtain patents, protect and enforce patents once issued and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our success will also depend on our ability to maintain exclusive rights to trade secrets and proprietary technology we own are currently developing and will develop. We can give no assurance that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by others, or that the patents of others will not restrict our ability to conduct business.

In addition, we rely on certain technology licensed with a perpetual term from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and may be required to license additional technologies in the future. We do not know if these third-party licenses will be available or will continue to be available to us on acceptable commercial terms or at all. The inability to enter into and maintain any of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of our operations.
 
Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights could entail significant expense. In addition, we do not know if third parties will bring claims of copyright or trademark infringement against us or claim that our use of certain technologies violates a patent or other intellectual property. Any claims of infringement, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management attention, require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements or prevent us from using important technologies or methods, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of our operations.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
Although our technologies presently are in the development stage, we are engaged in an early commercialization program intended to facilitate the transition from development to licensing, manufacturing and/or sale. This program consists of preliminary dialogues with potential strategic partners, investors, manufacturers, potential licensees and/or purchasers.
COMPETITION
 
As a result of our licensed technology, we do not have any direct competitors in our advanced materials operations. We may, however, face competition from leading researchers and manufacturers worldwide that develop competing technology.
 
With respect to our nanomedicine technology, our cancer detection technology will face competition primarily from companies such as Abbott Laboratories Inc., Cepheid Inc., Philips, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Gen-Probe Incorporated, MDxHealth SA, EpiGenomics AG, Roche Diagnostics and Sequenom, Inc.
 
Competitors may successfully challenge our licensed technology, produce similar products that do not infringe our licensed technology or produce products in countries where we have not applied for intellectual property protection. Many of these competitors may have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Furthermore, competitors may introduce new products that address our potential markets. Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.
 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and constantly evolving. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our technology markets include without limitation:
 

· | capitalization; 
--+-------------------------------------------------
· | cost of product; 
· | first to market with product in market segment; 
· | strong intellectual portfolio; 
· | product reliability; 
· | strong customer base; and 
· | strong manufacturing and supplier relationships.

CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, three customers generated all of our revenue. We did not have any significant suppliers.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had one full-time employee in general management as well as 10 employees employed by Imagion and Metallicum. We do not expect any significant change in the total number of employees in the near future. Most of our research and development work has been performed by employees of our various research and development independent contractors (see below). We have historically indirectly funded the salaries of these individuals through our contract research and development payments to their employers. Although not technically our employees, we have considered these individuals to be an integral part of our research and development team. None of our employees or contractors is members of any union or collective bargaining organization. We consider our relationships with our employee and our independent contractor employees to be good.
 
As noted above, a significant portion of our research and development has been performed by independent contractors from whom we acquired or licensed certain technologies, and their various employees. Our independent contractors utilize a number of their own various employees to satisfy their research and development obligations to us, and their employees are considered to be part of our research and development team.
