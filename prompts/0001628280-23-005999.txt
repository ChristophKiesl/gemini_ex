Item 1. Business
Business
Community Bank of the Chesapeake (the “Bank”) is headquartered in Southern Maryland with 12 branches located in Maryland and Virginia. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Community Financial Corporation (the “Company”). The Company provides a variety of financial services to individuals and businesses through its offices in Southern Maryland and Fredericksburg, Virginia. Its primary deposit products are demand, savings and time deposits, and its primary lending products are commercial and residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, construction and land development loans, home equity and second mortgages and commercial equipment loans.
The Company is a bank holding company organized in 1989 under the laws of the State of Maryland. It owns all the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank, a Maryland-chartered commercial bank. The Bank was organized in 1950 as Tri-County Building and Loan Association of Waldorf, a mutual savings and loan association, and in 1986 converted to a federal stock savings bank and adopted the name Tri-County Federal Savings Bank. In 1997, the Bank converted to a Maryland-chartered commercial bank and adopted the name Community Bank of Tri-County. Effective October 18, 2013, Community Bank changed its name to become Community Bank of the Chesapeake. The Company engages in no significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank and operating the business of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this 10-K, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries.
On December 14, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to undertake a merger of equals pursuant to which the Company and Bank will merge into Shore Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: SHBI) ("Shore") in an all-stock transaction. The combined company will have total assets of approximately $6.0 billion on a pro forma basis. Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and which remains subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, as well as the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, holders of TCFC common stock will have the right to receive 2.3287 shares of Shore Bancshares, Inc. common stock. The merger is expected to close in the late second quarter or early third quarter of 2023. James M. Burke, The Community Financial Corporation's current President and Chief Executive Officer, will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company.
The Company’s income is primarily earned from interest received on our loans and investments. Our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits. One of the key measures of our success is our net interest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which is called our net interest spread. In addition to earning interest on our loans and investments, we earn income through fees and other charges.
Our customer focus is to serve small and medium sized commercial businesses as well as local municipal agencies and not-for-profits. Relationship teams provide customers with specific banker contacts and a support team to address product and service demands. The Bank believes that its ability to offer fast, flexible, local decision-making will continue to attract significant new business relationships. Our structure provides a consistent and superior level of professional service and excelling at customer service is a critical part of our culture. 
We also serve our customers through our website: www.cbtc.com. In addition to providing our customers with 24-hour access to their accounts, and information regarding our products and services, hours of service, and locations, the website provides information about the Company for the investment community. Our filings with the SEC (including our annual report on Form 10-K; our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; and our current reports on Form 8-K), and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available without charge, and are posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. The website also provides information regarding our Board of Directors and management team, as well as Board Committee charters and our corporate governance policies. The content of our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
The Bank is engaged in the commercial and retail banking business as authorized by the banking statutes of the States of Maryland and Virginia and applicable federal regulations, including the acceptance of deposits, and the origination of loans. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Bank’s primary regulator.
Market Area
The Bank considers its principal lending and deposit market area to consist of the tri-county area in Southern Maryland and the greater Fredericksburg area in Virginia. As a result of the Bank’s expansion into the greater Fredericksburg market in 2013, Stafford and Spotsylvania Counties have become part of the Bank’s principal lending and deposit market area. Our market area is one of the fastest growing regions in the country and is home to a mix of federal facilities and industrial and high-tech businesses. The Bank’s primary market areas boast a strong median household income, low unemployment and projected population growth better than national averages. Based on information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rates in the Company’s footprint have historically remained 
well below the national average.
The presence of several major federal facilities located within the Bank’s footprint and in adjoining counties contribute to economic activity. Major federal facilities include the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in St. Mary’s County, the Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center in Charles County and the Naval Surface Warfare–Naval Support Facility in King George County. In addition, there are several major federal facilities located in adjoining markets including Andrews Air Force Base and Defense Intelligence Agency & Defense Intelligence Analysis Center in Prince Georges County, Maryland and the U.S. Marine Base Quantico, Drug Enforcement Administration Quantico facility and Federal Bureau of Investigation Quantico facility in Prince William County, Virginia. These facilities directly employ thousands of local employees and serve as an important contributor to the region’s overall economic health. The economic health of the region, while stabilized by the influence of the federal government, is not solely dependent on this sector. 
Competition
The Bank faces strong competition for deposits and loans primarily from other banks and credit unions located in its market area. There are more than 20 FDIC-insured depository institutions as well as several large credit unions operating in the Bank’s footprint including several large regional and national banks. The Bank also faces significant competition for deposits from mutual funds, brokerage firms, online Banks, and other financial service companies. The Bank competes for loans by providing competitive rates, flexible terms and personal service, including customer access to senior decision makers. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a variety of account types, convenient office locations and competitive rates. Other services offered include tax deferred retirement programs, brokerage services through an affiliation with Community Wealth Advisors, cash management services and safe deposit boxes. The Bank has used personal solicitation of lending and deposit employees, advertising, social media and community outreach to increase its market share of deposits, loans and other services in its market area. It provides ongoing training for its staff to provide high-quality service.
Economy
Economic conditions, competition, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government significantly affect most financial institutions, including the Bank. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in our market areas.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic dislocation in the United States. Although the domestic and global economies have begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time, including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains. The growth in economic activity and in the demand for goods and services, coupled with labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures and the risk of recession. In efforts to fight inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds rate from a target range of 0% to 0.25% to a target range of 4.25 – 4.50% during 2022. The sharp increase in interest rates in 2022 not only increased yields earned on floating-rate commercial loans and liquid interest-earning assets, but also increased rates paid on interest bearing demand deposits. In 2022, due to interest-earning asset rates and repricing slightly outpacing rate increases on interest-bearing liabilities and an increase in the average balances of the higher yielding commercial real estate loan portfolio, the Company's net interest margin increased from 3.34% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and currently, the region’s unemployment rate has remained below the national average. The presence of federal government agencies, as well as significant government facilities, and the related private sector support for these entities, has led to lower unemployment compared to the nation as a whole. These facilities directly employ thousands of local employees and serve as an important player in the region’s overall economic health. In addition, the Bank’s proximity to Washington DC, Annapolis, Northern Virginia and Prince George County has provided the Bank with additional loan and deposit opportunities. These opportunities have positively impacted the Bank’s organic growth. 
The impact of government shutdowns or sequestration is more acutely felt in the Bank’s footprint than in the rest of the United States. In addition to the temporary economic impact to government employees, the Bank’s business customers, which include government contractors that directly support the federal government and small businesses that indirectly support the government and its employees, can be impacted with permanent losses of revenue. A prolonged shutdown or a lack of confidence in the federal government’s ability to fund its operations could have an impact to spending and investments in the Company’s footprint. 
Overall, management is encouraged by the strength of our local economy. 
Lending Activities
General
The Bank offers a variety of commercial and consumer loans. The Bank’s lending activities include commercial real estate loans, loans 
secured by residential rental property, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, equipment financing, commercial and consumer loans. Most of the Bank’s customers are residents of or businesses located in the Bank’s market area. The Bank’s primary targets for commercial loans consist of small and medium-sized businesses as well as not-for-profits in Southern Maryland, the Annapolis and Prince George's County areas of Maryland and the greater Fredericksburg area of Virginia. The Bank’s target customers for consumer loans are people who live or work in these areas. For a description of the risk characteristics of the Bank's loan portfolio segments refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans
The permanent financing of commercial and other improved real estate projects, including office, medical and professional buildings, retail locations, churches, and other special purpose buildings, is the largest component of the Bank’s loan portfolio. The CRE portfolio includes commercial construction that converts after the completion of construction to permanent financing. 
Commercial real estate loans are secured by real property and the leases or businesses that produce income for the real property. The Bank generally limits its exposure to a single borrower to 15% of the Bank’s capital and participates with other lenders on larger projects. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally limited to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or sales price and have an initial contractual loan amortization period ranging from three to 20 years. Interest rates and payments on these loans typically adjust after an initial fixed-rate period, which is generally between three and ten years. Interest rates and payments on adjustable-rate loans are adjusted to a rate based on the United States Treasury Bill Index, London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or other indices. The Company began transitioning loans referenced to LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") in 2022. The great majority of the Bank’s commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate located in the Bank’s primary market area.
Payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on the successful operation of the business or management of the properties. Repayment of such loans may be subject to conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, the Bank requires borrowers and loan guarantors to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, the Bank considers the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property, as well as the borrower’s global cash flows. If a determination is made that there is a potential environmental hazard, the Bank will complete an Environmental Assessment Checklist. If this checklist or the appraisal indicates potential issues, a Phase 1 environmental survey will generally be required.
Residential First Mortgage Loans
Residential first mortgage loans are long-term loans, amortized on a monthly or bi-weekly basis, with principal and interest due each payment. These loans are secured by owner-occupied single-family homes. The initial contractual loan payment period for residential loans typically ranges from 10 to 30 years. Residential real estate loans typically remain outstanding for significantly shorter time periods than their contractual terms. Borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option, without penalty.
Residential first mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% carry private mortgage insurance to lower the Bank’s exposure to approximately 80% of the value of the property. The Bank had fewer than 50 loans with private mortgage insurance at December 31, 2022 and 2021. All improved real estate that serves as security for a loan made by the Bank must be insured.
Longer-term fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans are subject to interest-rate risk due to their long-term nature and limitations on interest rate adjustments. Adjustable mortgages are generally adjustable on one-, three-, five-, and seven-year terms with limitations on upward adjustments per re-pricing period and an upward cap over the life of the loan. The risk of default on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase during periods of rising interest rates due to the increasing interest costs to the borrower. 
Residential Rentals
Residential rental mortgage loans are amortizing, with principal and interest due each month. These loans are non-owner-occupied and secured by income-producing 1-4 family units and apartments. The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential rental first mortgages. Loans secured by residential rental properties are generally limited to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or sales price at origination and have initial contractual loan payments period ranging from three to 20 years. The primary securities on a residential rental loan are the property and the leases that produce income.
Loans secured by residential rental properties involve greater risks than 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. Although, there are similar risk characteristics shared with commercial real estate loans, the balances for the loans secured by residential rental properties are generally smaller. Payments on loans secured by residential rental properties are dependent on the successful operation of the properties and repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the rental real estate market or the economy than similar owner-occupied properties.
Construction and Land Development Loans
The Bank offers loans to home builders for the construction of residential dwellings. These loans are secured by the real estate under 
construction as well as by guarantees of the principals involved. Draws are made upon satisfactory completion of predefined stages of construction. The Bank will typically lend up to 80% of the lower of appraised value or the contract purchase price of the homes to be constructed. In addition, the Bank offers loans to acquire and develop land, as well as loans on undeveloped, subdivided lots for home building by individuals. Bank policy requires that zoning and permits must be in place prior to making development loans. The Bank typically lends up to the lower of 75% of the appraised value or cost. The Bank’s ability to originate residential construction and development loans is heavily dependent on the continued demand for single-family housing in the Bank’s market area. 
The Bank’s investment in these loans has declined in recent years as the Bank has deemphasized this product line.
Construction and Land Development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the underlying project, or the borrowers guarantee to repay the loan. As such, they are subject to the risks of the project including changing prices and interest rates. 
Home Equity and Second Mortgage Loans
The Bank has a portfolio of home equity and second mortgage loans. Home equity loans are lines of credit and have terms of up to 20 years, variable rates based on Wall Street Journal prime rate, and require an 80% or 90% loan-to-value ratio (including any prior liens). Second mortgage loans are fixed or variable-rate loans that have original terms between five and 15 years. These products contain a higher risk of default than residential first mortgages as in the event of foreclosure, the first mortgage must be paid off prior to collection of the second mortgage. 
Commercial Loans
The Bank offers its customers commercial loan products including term loans, demand loans, and lines of credit. Loans are generally made for terms of five years or less. The Bank offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. When making commercial business loans, the Bank considers the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower’s payment history, the projected cash flows of the business, the viability of the industry in which the borrower operates, the value of the collateral, and the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income. These loans are primarily secured by equipment, real property, accounts receivable or other collateral. These loans are dependent on the success of the underlying business or the strength of the guarantor. 
Consumer Loans
Consumer loans consist of loans secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles and trucks. The Bank also makes home improvement loans and offers both secured and unsecured personal lines of credit and credit card loans. Consumer loans entail greater risk from other loan types due to being secured by rapidly depreciating assets or the reliance on the borrower’s continuing financial stability.
Commercial Equipment Loans
The Bank has an amortizing commercial equipment loan portfolio. These loans consist primarily of fixed-rate, short-term loans collateralized by a commercial customer’s equipment or secured by real property, accounts receivable, or other collateral. When making commercial equipment loans, the Bank considers the same factors it considers when underwriting a commercial business loan. Commercial loans are of higher risk than commercial real estate loans. These loans are dependent on the success of the underlying business or the strength of the guarantor. 
Small Business Administration Payment Protection Program ("SBA PPP")
The U.S. SBA PPP loan was created to address economic hardships resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. SBA PPP loans carry a two-or five-year term at a 1% annual interest rate until the loan is either forgiven or paid and are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. The Bank's ACL does not include an allowance for U.S. SBA PPP loans. Management believes all PPP loans were underwritten in accordance with the program's guidelines. The U.S. SBA PPP guidelines indicate that lenders may rely on certifications of the borrower in order to determine eligibility and to rely on specified documents provided by the borrower to determine qualifying loan amount and eligibility for forgiveness. The guidelines further specify that lenders will be held harmless for a borrowers’ failure to comply with program criteria.
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales
The Bank solicits loan applications through marketing by commercial loan officers, its branch network, and referrals from customers. Loans are processed and approved according to Bank guidelines. Loan processing functions are generally centralized except for small consumer loans.
The Bank generally retains the right to service loans sold for a payment based upon a percentage (generally 0.25% of the outstanding loan balance). The Company sold $1.8 million of residential mortgage loans under this program for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $5.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. 
To comply with internal and regulatory limits on loans to one borrower, the Bank may sell portions of commercial, commercial real estate 
and commercial construction loans to other lenders. The Bank may also buy loans or portions of loans from other lenders. The Bank only purchases loans or portions of loans after reviewing loan documents, underwriting support, and completing other procedures. Purchased participation loans are subject to the same regulatory and internal policy requirements as other loans in the Bank’s portfolio.
Loan Approvals, Procedures and Authority
Loan approval authority is established by Board policy.
All loans and loan relationships that exceed the Bank’s in-house lending limit are required to be approved by at least three (3) members of the Bank’s Credit Risk Committee ("CRC"). In addition, the Board of Directors or the CRC approve all loans required to be approved by regulation, such as Regulation O loans or commercial loans to employees. The in-house lending guideline is approved by the Board and is less than the Bank’s legal lending limit.
The Officer’s Loan Committee ("OLC") consists of the following members of the Bank’s executive management; the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and President, Chief Business Officer, Chief Lending Officer and the Senior Credit Officer ("SCO"). Three members of the OLC must approve all loans that meet the OLC threshold. Loans that fall below the OLC threshold are approved by the appropriate level of line and credit. 
Loans to One Borrower
Under Maryland law, the maximum amount that the Bank is permitted to lend to any one borrower and his or her related interests may generally not exceed 10% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, which is defined to include the Bank’s capital, surplus, retained earnings and 100% of its reserve for possible credit losses. Under this authority, the Bank would have been permitted to lend up to $26.0 million to any one borrower at December 31, 2022. By interpretive ruling of the Maryland Commissioner, Maryland banks have the option of lending up to the amount that would be permissible for a national bank, which is generally 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (defined to include a bank’s total capital for regulatory capital purposes plus any loan loss allowances not included in regulatory capital). Under this formula, the Bank would have been permitted to lend up to $40.7 million to any one borrower at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the largest amount outstanding and committed to any one borrower and borrower’s related interests was $29.4 million.
Loan Commitments
The Bank negotiates standby commitments for the construction and purchase of real estate. It has been the Bank’s experience that few commitments expire unfunded. Refer to Note 18 "Commitments and Contingencies" in the consolidated financial statements for more information.
Maturity of Loan Portfolio
See Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") for information regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity as of December 31, 2022. 
Asset Classification
Federal regulations require use of an internal asset classification system to report on asset quality. We use an internal asset classification system, consistent with Federal banking regulations, as a part of our credit monitoring system. Federal banking regulations set forth a classification scheme for problem and potential problem assets as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the sound worth or paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the Bank has determined that loss is not only possible but is probable and the risk is close to certain that loss will occur. Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of these categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated “special mention.”
Assets classified as “substandard” or “doubtful,” require a specific valuation allowance for credit losses be established in an amount deemed prudent by management. Assets classified as “loss,” require either a specific allowance or charge-off for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset. For additional information regarding the Company's credit quality indicators and risk grading scale refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in the MD&A.
Delinquencies
The Bank’s collection procedures provide that when a loan is 15 days delinquent, the borrower is contacted, and payment is requested. If the delinquency continues, efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower and obtain payment. If these efforts prove unsuccessful, the Bank will pursue appropriate legal action including repossession of the collateral. In certain instances, the Bank will attempt to modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize borrower’s financial affairs. For an analysis 
of past due loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, refer to Note 3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Individually Assessed Loans 
Loans that do not share the same common risk characteristics with other loans are individually assessed. Such loans include non-accrual loans, TDRs, loans classified as substandard or worse, loans that are greater than 89 days delinquent and any other loan identified by management for individual assessment. Reserves on individually assessed loans are measured on a loan-by-loan basis. Generally, consumer loans, including credit cards, are not individually assessed as the Bank's policy is to charge-off credit card loans when they become 180 days delinquent and other consumer loans when they are more than 90 days delinquent. For additional information regarding the Company's specific reserve methodology as well as the allowance for credit losses refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion in the MD&A under Critical Accounting Policies and Asset Quality.
Non-performing Assets
The Bank’s non-performing assets include other real estate owned, non-accrual loans and TDRs. Both non-accrual and TDR loans include loans that are paid current and are performing in accordance with the term of their original or modified contract terms. For a detailed discussion on asset quality see the MD&A. 
Investment Activities
The Bank maintains a portfolio of investment securities to provide liquidity as well as a source of earnings. The Bank’s investment securities portfolio consists of asset-backed mortgage-backed (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) and other securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), including FNMA and FHLMC. The Bank also has holdings of privately issued mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury obligations, municipal bonds and other equity and debt securities. The Bank is required to maintain investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank based upon levels of borrowings.
The Bank’s investment policy provides that securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time, including securities that will be used as part of the Bank’s asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayments and similar factors are classified as AFS and accounted for at fair value. There were no HTM investments securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Certain of the Company’s asset-backed securities are issued by private issuers (defined as an issuer that is not a government or a government-sponsored entity). The Company had no investments in any private issuer’s securities that aggregate to more than 10% of the Company’s equity. For a discussion of investments see the MD&A and Notes 1 and 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deposits and Other Sources of Funds
General
The funds needed by the Bank to make loans are primarily generated by deposit accounts solicited from its market area. The Company has lines of credit and brokered deposits available to supplement loan funding and for asset-liability management purposes. Reciprocal deposits are used to maximize FDIC insurance available to our customers. During 2018, revisions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act determined that reciprocal deposits are core deposits and are not considered brokered deposits unless they exceed 20% of a bank’s liabilities or $5.0 billion.
Deposits
The Bank’s deposit products include savings, money market, demand deposit and time deposit accounts. Products and services for deposit customers include safe deposit boxes, night depositories, cash vaults, automated clearinghouse transactions, wire transfers, ATMs, online and telephone banking, retail and business mobile banking, remote deposit capture, FDIC insured reciprocal deposits, merchant card services, credit monitoring, investment services, positive pay, payroll services, account reconciliation, bill pay, credit cards and lockbox. The Bank is a member of ACCEL, Master Card, Allpoint and Star ATM networks as well as the Bazing online membership discount program. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank operated 12 automated teller machines ("ATM") which includes one stand-alone location, and three interactive teller machines ("ITM") at the Fredericksburg-Harrison Crossing location. 
For a discussion of deposits, see the MD&A and Notes 1 and 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Borrowings
Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Bank’s lending and investment activities and for its general business purposes. The Bank uses advances from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement the supply of funds it may lend and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are secured by the Bank’s stock in the FHLB, a portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio and certain investments. Generally, the Bank’s ability to borrow from the FHLB of Atlanta is limited by its available collateral and also by an overall limitation of 30% of assets. Further, short-term credit facilities are available at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and commercial banks. Long-term debt consists of adjustable-rate advances with rates based upon LIBOR (or SOFR), fixed-rate advances, and convertible advances.
For a discussion of borrowing, see the MD&A and Notes 1, 8, 9 and 10 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Subsidiary Activities
The Company has two direct subsidiaries other than the Bank. In July 2004, Tri-County Capital Trust I was established as a statutory trust under Delaware law as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to issue trust preferred securities. Tri-County Capital Trust I issued $7.0 million of trust preferred securities on July 22, 2004. In June 2005, Tri-County Capital Trust II was also established as a statutory trust under Delaware law as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to issue trust preferred securities. Tri-County Capital Trust II issued $5.0 million of trust preferred securities on June 15, 2005. For more information regarding these entities, see Note 9 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Human Capital
Our Mission and Culture
Community Bank’s mission is to exceed the expectations of our community, today and tomorrow. The Bank’s corporate culture is defined by core values which include integrity, accountability, professionalism, diversity, community-focused and communicative. We value our employees by investing in competitive compensation and benefit packages and fostering a team environment centered on professional service and open communication. Attracting, retaining and developing qualified, engaged employees who embody these values are crucial to the success of the Bank and Company. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Employee Demographics
As of December 31, 2022, Community Bank employed 198 full and part time employees (196 full time equivalent employees) of which approximately 73% were women. In addition, for those employees identifying as such, approximately 30% of our workforce have diverse ethnic backgrounds. The Bank’s employees were not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 
The Company has no employees and reimburses the Bank for estimated expenses, including an allocation of salaries and benefits.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to building a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment which are supported by our culture and values. We strive to attract and retain employees with diverse characteristics, backgrounds and perspectives, which inspires our team to achieve more creative and innovative solutions for our customers. With a commitment to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity, we focus on understanding, accepting, and valuing the differences between people. Our commitment to equal employment opportunities is demonstrated through an affirmative action plan which includes annual compensation analyses, ongoing reviews of our selection and hiring practices and an annual review of our plan to ensure we build and maintain a diverse workforce. 
Compensation and Benefits
The Bank’s compensation and benefits package is designed to attract and retain a talented workforce. The Bank’s minimum wage for entry level positions is $20.00 per hour. In addition to salaries, benefits include a 401(k) plan with an employer matching contribution, an employee stock ownership plan, medical insurance benefits, paid short-term and long-term disability and life insurance, flexible spending accounts, tuition reimbursement, wellness benefits, paid time off, family leave and an employee assistance program. 
Professional Development
The Bank invests in the growth of its employees by providing access to professional development and continuing education courses and seminars that are relevant to the banking industry and their job function within the Company. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in various professional and leadership development programs. On-demand training opportunities include a variety of industry, technical, professional, business development, leadership and regulatory topics. Training to communicate the Bank’s culture, behavioral standards and expectations to employees is an important part of our training program.
Employee Health and Safety
The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges to maintain employee safety while continuing successful operations. To support our employees and customers during this time the Bank developed a pandemic response plan which established a phased approach for operating in the pandemic environment. The Bank greatly expanded remote work, established employee engagement and feedback initiatives to understand and respond to employee needs and concerns, broadened benefit offerings and established safety protocols regarding cleaning, personal hygiene and physical distancing to minimize the spread of illness in our work environments. The Bank did not furlough or lay-off any employees as a result of the pandemic. 
Supervision and Regulation
Regulation of the Company
General
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also has enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders, and to require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 
The following discussion summarizes certain of the regulations applicable to the Company but does not purport to be a complete description of such regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
Acquisition of Control
A bank holding company, with certain exceptions, must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before (1) acquiring ownership or control of another bank or bank holding company if it would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank or bank holding company (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging with another bank holding company. In evaluating such application, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial condition and managerial resources of the companies involved, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and competitive factors. Federal law provides that no person may acquire “control” of a bank holding company or insured bank without the approval of the appropriate federal regulator. Control is defined to mean direct or indirect ownership, control of 25% or more of any class of voting stock, control of the election of a majority of the bank’s directors or a determination by the Federal Reserve Board that the acquirer has or would have the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution.
The Maryland Financial Institutions Code additionally prohibits any person from acquiring more than 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of securities of a bank or bank holding company or electing a majority of the directors or directing the management or policies of any such entity, without the prior approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may deny approval of the acquisition if the Commissioner determines it to be anti-competitive or to threaten the safety or soundness of a banking institution.
Permissible Activities
A bank holding company is limited in its activities to banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Other permitted non-bank activities have been identified as closely related to banking. Bank holding companies that are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and whose financial institution subsidiaries have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act records can elect to become “financial holding companies,” which are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities than are permitted to bank holding companies. The Company has not opted to become a financial holding company.
The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company.
The Maryland Financial Institutions Code provides that no bank holding company may acquire a Maryland bank holding company or a Maryland bank without the approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may deny approval of an application if the acquisition may (1) be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the Maryland bank holding company or Maryland bank to be acquired or (2) result in undue concentration of resources or a substantial reduction of competition in the state.
The Maryland Financial Institutions Code additionally prohibits any person from acquiring more than 25% of the outstanding voting shares of any class of securities of a Maryland bank or Maryland bank holding company, or directing the management or policies of any such entity, without the prior approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may deny approval of the acquisition if the Commissioner determines it to be anti-competitive or to threaten the safety or soundness of a banking institution.
Dividend
The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a prospective rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems or that has inadequate capital to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.” See 
“Regulation of the Bank – Capital Adequacy.”
Sources of Strength
The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine requiring bank holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries, by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
Stock Repurchases
A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption. This requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are “well capitalized,” “well-managed” and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
Capital Requirement
The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks apply to bank holding companies; as is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was phased in between 2016 and 2019. However, the Federal Reserve Board has provided a “small bank holding company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements, and legislation and the related issuance of regulations by the Federal Reserve Board has increased the threshold for the exception to $3.0 billion. As a result, the Company will not be subject to the capital requirement until such time as its consolidated assets exceed $3.0 billion.
Regulation of the Bank
General
The Bank is a Maryland commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the State of Maryland (the “Commissioner”) and the FDIC.
The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB assumed responsibility for implementing federal consumer financial protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function formerly handled by federal bank regulatory agencies. However, institutions of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection or fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to enforcement authority of their primary federal regulators.
The following discussion summarizes regulations applicable to the Bank but does not purport to be a complete description of such regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
Capital Adequacy
Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 capital to average assets leverage ratio of 4%.
For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital contains capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income “AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank exercised the opt-out and therefore does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital determinations. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (such as recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset 
categories believed to present greater risk. 
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, the Bank exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the capital conservation buffer.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in May 2018 required the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to establish for banks with assets of less than $10 billion of assets a community bank leverage ratio (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets). The community bank leverage ratio was 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter. The Bank has not elected to utilize the community bank leverage ratio alternative reporting framework.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For such purposes, the law establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, and a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and generally a leverage capital ratio of 4% or greater. An institution is deemed to be “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5% or generally a leverage capital ratio of less than 4%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage capital ratio of less than 3%. An institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.
“Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. An institution’s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the bank’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” Significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, a regulatory order requiring them to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized; requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, or dismiss directors or officers; and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the parent holding company.
Beginning 60 days after becoming “critically undercapitalized,” critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt, extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction, or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business. In addition, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within 270 days after it obtains such status.
Branching
Maryland law provides that, with the approval of the Commissioner, Maryland banks may establish branches within Maryland and may establish branches in other states by any means permitted by the laws of such state or by federal law. The FDIC may approve interstate branching by merger in any state that did not opt out and de novo in states that specifically allow for such branching.
Dividend Limitations
Maryland banks may only pay cash dividends from undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, their surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock. Maryland banks may not declare a stock dividend unless their surplus, after the increase in capital stock, is equal to at least 20% of the outstanding capital stock as increased. If the surplus of the bank, after the increase in capital stock, is less than 100% of its capital stock as increased, the commercial bank must annually transfer to surplus at least 10% of its net earnings until the surplus is 100% of its capital stock as increased.
Without the approval of the FDIC, a Federal Reserve nonmember bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the year exceeds its net income during the current calendar year and retained net income for the prior two years. The Bank is further prohibited from making a capital distribution if it would not be adequately capitalized thereafter.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000.
Under the FDIC risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and other factors, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. The initial base assessment rate ranges from three to 30 basis points. The rate schedules automatically adjust when the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches certain milestones. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or its prudential banking regulator. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
The Bank is required to monitor large deposit relationships and concentration risks in accordance with FDIC policy. This includes monitoring deposit concentrations and maintaining fund management policies and strategies that take into account potentially volatile concentrations and significant deposits that mature simultaneously. The FDIC defines a large depositor as a customer or entity that owns or controls 2% or more of the Bank’s total deposits. 
Reserve Requirements
The Federal Reserve Board historically required depository institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves against transaction accounts. However, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the reserve requirement to 0% as of March 26, 2020 for all depository institutions.
Transactions with Affiliates
The Bank, as a state nonmember bank, is limited in the amount of “covered transactions” with any affiliate. Covered transactions must also be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the Bank or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions. Certain covered transactions, such as loans to affiliates, must meet collateral requirements. At December 31, 2022, we had no covered transactions with affiliates.
Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a state nonmember bank must be made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with persons who are not executive officers, directors, principal stockholders or employees of the bank. Loans to any executive officer, director and principal stockholder together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests generally may not exceed 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, in excess of the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus, or any loans cumulatively aggregating $500,000 or more, must be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the Bank with any “interested” director not participating in the voting. State nonmember banks are prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or directors unless payment is made pursuant to a written, pre-authorized interest-bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or transfer of funds from another account at the Bank. In addition, loans to executive officers may not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded other borrowers and are restricted as to type, amount and terms of credit.
Enforcement
The Commissioner has enforcement authority over Maryland banks. This includes the ability to issue cease and desist orders and civil money penalties and to remove directors or officers. The Commissioner may also take possession of a Maryland bank whose capital is impaired and seek to have a receiver appointed by a court. The FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over state banks under its jurisdiction, including the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-related parties,” including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the assessment of civil money penalties (or criminal penalties, in cases of financial institution crimes), the issuance of capital directive or a cease-and-desist order for the removal of officers and/or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance.
Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for violations of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, and to seek the kind of cease and desist orders applicable to entities subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief). In May 2022, the CFPB issued an Interpretive Rule to clarify the authority of states to enforce federal consumer financial protections laws under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (“CFPA”). Specifically, the CFPB confirmed that: (1) states can enforce the CFPA, including the provision making it unlawful for covered persons or service providers to violate any provision of federal consumer financial protection law; (2) the enforcement authority of states under section 1042 of the CFPA is generally not subject to 
certain limits applicable to the CFPB’s enforcement authority, such that States may be able to bring actions against a broader cross-section of companies than the CFPB; and (3) state attorneys general and regulators may bring (or continue to pursue) actions under their CFPA authority even if the CFPB is pursuing a concurrent action against the same entity. 
State Regulation and Licensing Requirements
The Bank’s operations generally must satisfy the laws and standards of each individual U.S. state in which it operates. This means that when individual states differ in how they allow consumer financial products and services to be provided and used, the Bank must operate consistently in accordance with the most comprehensive requirements. Many states have consumer protection laws analogous to, or in addition to, the federal laws listed below, such as usury laws, state debt collection practices laws, and requirements regarding loan disclosures and terms, credit discrimination, credit reporting, money transmission, recordkeeping, and unfair or deceptive business practices. 
Certain states have adopted laws regulating and requiring licensing, registration, notice filing, or other approval for parties that engage in certain activity regarding consumer finance transactions. Furthermore, certain states and localities have adopted laws requiring licensing, registration, notice filing, or other approval for consumer debt collection or servicing, and/or purchasing or selling consumer loans. The licensing statutes vary from state to state and prescribe different requirements, including but not limited to: restrictions on loan origination and servicing practices (including limits on the type, amount, and manner of fees), interest rate limits, disclosure requirements, periodic examination requirements, surety bond and minimum specified net worth requirements, periodic financial reporting requirements, notification requirements for changes in principal officers, stock ownership or corporate control, restrictions on advertising, and requirements that loan forms be submitted for review. The Bank may also be subject to supervision and examination by applicable state regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which it may offer consumer financial products or services. 
Supervision and Regulation of Mortgage Banking Operations
The Bank’s mortgage banking business is subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), the Veterans’ Administration (“VA”) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines, which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, and fix maximum loan amounts. Lenders are required annually to submit audited financial statements to Fannie Mae, FHA and VA. Each of these regulatory entities has its own financial requirements. The Bank is also subject to examination by Fannie Mae, FHA and VA to assure compliance with the applicable regulations, policies and procedures. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and related regulations that prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs. The Bank’s mortgage banking operations are also affected by various state and local laws and regulations and the requirements of various private mortgage investors.
Other Regulations
The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, and their implementing regulations, including the:
•Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
•Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for 1-4 family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
•Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
•Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
•Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978 and Regulation V, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
•Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Regulation F, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, each governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies and certain creditors; 
•Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, authorizing the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures;
•Military Lending Act, providing disclosure requirements, interest rate limitations, substantive conduct obligations, and prohibitions on certain behavior relating to loans made to covered borrowers, which include both servicemembers and their dependents;
•Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, setting certain interest rate limitations and allowing active duty military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties; and
•Other rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
The operations of the Bank also are subject to laws such as the:
•Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
•Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and
•Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check. 
•Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy statute which requires each depository institution to disclose its privacy policy, identify parties with whom certain nonpublic customer information is shared and provide customers with certain rights to “opt out” of disclosure to certain third parties;
•Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (“BSA), requiring financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Under the BSA, a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the United States Treasury;
•Title III of The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (referred to as the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which significantly expands the responsibilities of financial institutions in preventing the use of the United States financial system to fund terrorist activities. Among other things, the USA PATRIOT Act and the related regulations requires banks operating in the United States to develop anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to facilitate the detection and reporting of money laundering;
•The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), which provides that a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA requires each federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a financial institution, to assess and assign a rating to the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of the community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution, including applications for charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities, and savings and loan holding company acquisitions;
•The Fair and Accurate Reporting Act of 2003, as an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as noted previously, which includes provisions to help reduce identity theft by providing procedures for the identification, detection, and response to patterns, practices, or specific activities known as “red flags”; and
•Truth in Savings Act, which establishes the requirement for clear and uniform disclosure of terms and conditions regarding deposit interest and fees to help promote economic stability, competition between depository institutions, and allow the consumer to make informed decisions.
