Software and Hi-Tech. We provide complex software product development services to meet software and technology companies’ constant need for innovation and agility. We help some of the most prominent software brands in the world build, what we believe to be, the best software. Through our extensive experience with many industry leaders in Hi-Tech research and development, software engineering and integration, we have developed proprietary internal processes, methodologies and information technology infrastructure, which give us an edge when it comes to serving customers in the Hi-Tech and Software product markets. Our services span the complete software development lifecycle for software product development using our comprehensive development methodologies, testing, performance tuning, deployment, maintenance and support.

These customers are included in our Emerging Verticals, which are further discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Customers
We maintain a geographically diverse client base in multiple industries. Our focus on delivering quality service is reflected in established relationships with many of our customers, with 58.5% and 26.1% of our revenues in 2020 coming from customers that had used our services for at least five and ten years, respectively. Our sustained growth and increased capabilities are furthered by both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisition targets that can expand our vertical-specific domain expertise, geographic footprint, service portfolio, client base and management expertise. 
We remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more customers to our client mix; however, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economic landscape during 2020 and influenced business decisions of our existing and potential customers. We were able to capitalize on demand for our services at our larger customers whereas we realized less revenue growth from our smaller customers. However, over the long-term, we expect revenue concentration from our top customers to decrease. 
The following table shows revenues from the top five and ten customers in the respective year as a percentage of revenues for that year: 

 | % of Revenues for Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Top five customers | 22.0 | % | | 19.9 | % | 22.3 | %
Top ten customers | 30.9 | % | | 29.1 | % | 31.6 | %

See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to revenues.

Global Delivery Model
We believe the development of a robust global delivery model creates a key competitive advantage, enabling us to better understand and meet our customers’ diverse needs and to provide a compelling value proposition. We continuously grow our delivery platform both organically and through strategically acquired locations and personnel with diversified skills that support our strategy. We had 36,737 delivery personnel as of December 31, 2020, which mainly includes our core information technology professionals as well as designers, consultants and scientists. 
We serve our customers through on-site, off-site and offshore locations across the world and use strategically located delivery centers to offer a strong, diversified and cost-effective delivery platform. Our largest delivery centers are located in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia and our delivery model has not been materially affected by the political and economic uncertainty in these locations. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 9,638 delivery professionals located in Belarus. The majority of these delivery professionals are located in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which is well-positioned to serve as a prime IT outsourcing destination given its strong industrial base and established educational infrastructure. Furthermore, the government in Belarus encourages investment in this sector through various long-term tax incentives. 
Our locations in Ukraine and Russia offer many of the same benefits as Belarus, including educational infrastructure, availability of qualified software engineers and government support of the technology industry. As of December 31, 2020, we had 9,115 delivery professionals in Ukraine and 6,348 delivery professionals in Russia. 
Our other significant locations with delivery professionals are the United States with 2,292, India with 2,052, Poland with 1,721, Hungary with 1,534, Mexico with 607, and China with 534 as of December 31, 2020. 
Human Capital
Our more than 41,000 employees are a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and serve our customers. Therefore, our ability to identify, attract, hire and retain people who are highly skilled in information technology as delivery professionals, as well as individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other key management positions, is critical to our success. We believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our customers and investors. To attract, retain and motivate our employees, we offer a challenging work environment, a culture that values the individual, ongoing skills development initiatives, attractive career advancement with continuous rotation and promotion opportunities while providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had a total of 41,168, 36,739, and 30,156 employees, respectively. Of these employees, as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, 36,737, 32,561, and 26,760 of those employees were delivery professionals.
Health, Safety, and Wellness: We invest in programs designed to improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of our employees so we can offer a safe, welcoming, and productive workplace. Our health and safety programs are designed to comply with the regulations and address the conditions in the multiple jurisdictions where we have people and facilities, and further designed to be compatible with the working necessities of our delivery and administrative operations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were consistent with public health guidance and were in the best interest of our employees, our customers, and the communities where we work and live. Our primary changes were to ask the vast majority of our employees to work from home, to implement additional safety measures at our offices and delivery centers, and to develop new technologies for employees who were required to report to work in our or our customers’ facilities. 
Recognizing that the abrupt changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and remote working had the potential to significantly disrupt the work-life balance and wellness of our employees, we increased awareness of existing programs that focus on enhancing our employees’ mental well-being. We also developed new programs, such as a parenting resource group where peers could share tips, resources, and ideas to support each other while schools and child and elder care facilities were closed, and broadcast live town hall-style forums where our senior leadership could listen to and quickly address employees’ questions and concerns.

Recruitment, Training and Utilization: As an innovation-driven business in a competitive industry, our success depends on hiring the most talented employees in the industry and effectively training and deploying them using utilization practices and technologies to satisfy the demands of our customers. We actively monitor our utilization rates to balance the needs of our customers, the availability, location, and skill sets of our employees, and the need for our employees to engage in diverse and challenging work. We have dedicated full-time employees who oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including talent acquisition teams whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced professionals around the world. We manage utilization through strategic hiring and efficiently staffing projects for our customers. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the full year utilization rates of our delivery professionals were approximately 79.8%, 78.0%, and 78.1 %, respectively. We are continuously exploring new geographies and markets as sources of talent.
EPAM invests significant resources in training and developing our employees through our learning and development programs. Our largest learning and development investment has been directed towards developing our engineering talent, including targeted training programs, innovation labs, and significant internal production projects. Our employees consumed over 1.6 million learning hours in 2020. We deliver learning opportunities and content through our unique learning ecosystem that promotes learning in the daily workflow to improve retention and productivity, and through dedicated events, including our week-long global learning event, which featured approximately 200 online sessions. We have also built relationships with laboratories and technical universities so our employees can be exposed to the current thinking in academia. We regularly host or participate in “hackathons” so our employees can build technical skills and foster communities around specific technologies and areas of interest. 
We deliver learning and development content through proprietary platforms that make learning and development content easily available to all of our employees. Our digital learning platform provides our employees with an interface to meet our employees’ learning and training needs and includes a recommendation engine that suggests courses and materials based on employee role, level, location and skills. Our electronic library platform makes books and publications available to all of our employees and we celebrate learning achievements through our recognition portal, where we promote our employees’ learning accomplishments and employees can recognize each other for their teamwork, initiative, and unique, valuable skills.
Diversity and Inclusion: EPAM provides our customers with the skills of our talented personnel, which includes people with varied and diverse backgrounds and characteristics, to drive innovation and thought diversity in delivering our services. We believe that innovation comes from the unique perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our global employees, so we strive to create an inclusive culture by offering comprehensive language learning programs and providing structured education in communication skills and cultural sensitivity and awareness. 
Increasing diversity in executive and key operational leadership roles is an organizational priority that starts at the top of our organization. For example, women currently represent approximately 29% of the independent directors on our Board. We have developed programs, both within EPAM and externally, so we can continuously retain and supply a pipeline of qualified, diverse candidates to foster our goals. Our programs include dedicating resources and personnel in our talent acquisition team to identify, recognize, and use diverse and inclusive sources for hiring, including associating with organizations that are focused on promoting underrepresented groups in engineering, IT, and business. We also developed the Emerging Engineers Lab, an internship program for entry-level talent sourced from a variety of diverse technology programs across the U.S. Participants who successfully complete the paid training program are ready to engage on billable customer engagements with the rest of our delivery professionals. We also supplemented our mandatory annual training with materials geared towards eliminating unconscious bias in our professional interactions.
Our employees have driven the creation of discussion forums focused on diversity and inclusion topics important to them and organized participation in global and local events, including International Women’s Day and Pride celebrations. Recognizing that improving the number of underrepresented people in the software and technology industries starts with access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (“STEM”) education, EPAM has associated with technical universities in our largest employee population geographies to bolster post-secondary STEM education. We also created the EPAM E-KIDS program where our employees volunteer their time to teach elementary school age children of any gender, race, or ethnic identity STEM concepts and introductory software coding skills. As of the end of 2020, we offered the EPAM E-KIDS program in 13 countries. 
Employee Engagement and Retention: We are committed to respecting our employees' fundamental human rights at work and accordingly are a participant in the United Nations Global Compact. We believe that retaining skilled talent requires substantially more than meeting basic employment and labor rights, and that employees who are fairly compensated, feel supported in their career development, and are engaged with their employer are more likely to remain with that employer. That is why we strive to provide pay and benefits that demonstrate the value of our employees to us, including a competitive salary, flexible work-life balance, paid time off, health coverage, ongoing training programs, relocation options, and recognition opportunities for open source software contributions.

We believe that the career development programs we offer both attract new talent and help retain existing employees. 
Our career development programs create detailed and progressive training plans for our employees and help them choose from internal and external training options, mentoring programs, and hands-on opportunities to experience emerging technology areas. These programs are housed in proprietary platforms that provide our employees with a framework for the skill development they will need to build their career path, identify skill gaps, and set professional development goals. We designed our career development programs to enable our employees to develop the best engineering practices and influence engineering culture, develop thought leadership in technical and strategic skills, and introduce them to leaders in the field at our industry conferences. Our career development programs also give our employees opportunities to earn accreditation and relevant expertise in various technology fields, including software and project management certifications and recognition and credentialing from the industry’s primary software and cloud services providers. 
EPAM focuses on retaining and engaging top talent by focusing on hiring people with the skill sets our customers need and who also fit our values so we can build long-term employee satisfaction. We endeavor to recruit for careers, not for short-term projects, and actively foster feedback from our employees so we can improve the EPAM employee experience, identify opportunities to strengthen our culture and improve retention, and help our people develop their careers. We believe our ability to effectively hire, engage, and retain high-skilled personnel is a principal competitive factor in our business, which is evidenced by our 2020 voluntary attrition rate of 10.8%, which decreased compared to our 2019 and 2018 voluntary attrition rate of 13.3 % and 14.8 %, respectively. Moreover, our employees have demonstrated their satisfaction with our approach by giving their highest ratings in our 2020 annual employee survey to the following areas: trust in management (93.4/100), good working environment (93.0/100), cooperation between teams (89.8/100), and employee contribution to EPAM’s success (89.6/100). Receiving and responding to employee feedback plays a critical role in engaging and retaining our employees because it offers us an opportunity to improve our operations and for our employees to continually enhance their skills. 
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services through our senior management, sales and business development teams, account managers, and professional staff. Our client service professionals and account managers, who maintain direct customer relationships, play an integral role in engaging with current customers to identify and pursue potential business opportunities. This strategy has been effective in promoting repeat business and growth from within our existing customer base and we believe that our reputation as a reliable provider of software engineering solutions drives additional business from inbound requests and referrals. In addition to effective client management, our sales model also utilizes an integrated sales and marketing approach that leverages a dedicated sales team to identify and acquire new accounts. 
We maintain a marketing team, which coordinates corporate-level branding efforts such as participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events as well as sponsorship of programming competitions. We have been recognized by many top global independent research agencies, such as Forrester, Gartner, Zinnov and HFS and by publications such as Forbes and Fortune.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as Eastern Europe, India and China. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, end-to-end solution offerings, a reputation for and a track record of high-quality and on-time delivery of work, effective employee recruiting, training and retention, responsiveness to customers’ business needs, scale, financial stability and price.
We face competition from various technology services providers such as Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, Exlservice, Genpact, GlobalLogic, Globant, HCL Technologies, HP Enterprise, IBM Services, Infosys, Mindtree, Perficient, Tata Consultancy Services, Virtusa Corporation, and Wipro, among others. Additionally, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.
We believe that our focus on complex and innovative software product development solutions, our technical employee base, and our development and continuous improvement in process methodologies, applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future.

Quality Management and Information Security 
We are continuously investing in applications, tools and infrastructure to manage all aspects of our global delivery process in order to manage quality and security risks, while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our customers. We maintain processes and infrastructure to protect our customers’ and their customers’ confidential and sensitive information and allocate resources to ensure information security, cybersecurity and data privacy. We have made significant investments in the appropriate people, processes and technology to establish and manage compliance with confidentiality policies, laws and regulations governing our activities, such as the European Union data protection legal framework referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and others. 
We focus on establishing stringent security standards and internal controls and meet the standards of ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 9001:2015. We are an ISAE 3402 Type 2 certified IT services provider. This certification is issued by an auditor in compliance with the globally recognized assurance standard. The certification, along with others we hold, provide our customers with independent third-party verification of our information security, quality management and general controls practices.
We have developed sophisticated project management techniques facilitated through our proprietary project management tools, a web-based collaborative environment for software development, which we consider critical for visibility into project deliverables, resource management, team messaging and project-related documents. These tools promote collaboration and effective oversight, reduce work time and costs, and increase quality for our IT management and our customers. 
Corporate and Social Responsibility
We are committed to integrating positive social, environmental and ethical practices into our business operations and strategy. This commitment is key to our continual development as a business and drives value for our employees, customers, business partners, the community and other stakeholders. We practice the principles established in our Code of Ethical Conduct by making positive contributions to the communities in which we operate and championing corporate social responsibility efforts.  
Through our focused efforts in the areas of Education, Environment, and Community, we are committed to sharing the expertise and attributes of our highly skilled global workforce to effectively support the needs of, and positively add to the world at large and the communities where we work and live. By understanding our impact on local, regional and global communities, we strive to create positive change and opportunities in areas where it is needed most. Such efforts include our global technology education initiatives, through which we provide innovative, industry-relevant technology training and mentorship programs to students globally as well as through other technology conferences, seminars, and hackathon events where we encourage social innovation and jumpstart collaboration among our local tech communities. We maintain strong relationships with the leading technical institutions in Eastern Europe and we support these universities through EPAM-branded research labs, developing training courses and curriculum, providing teaching equipment and engaging students to identify their talents in information technology. 
We believe responsible stewardship of the environment is critical, and we take this responsibility seriously. We continually strive to improve our environmental performance through implementation of sustainable development and environmental practices including recycling and upcycling electronics and computers and designing and releasing a carbon footprint calculator to our employees and the general public. In addition, as an innovation-driven business, EPAM’s success depends on hiring the most talented employees in the industry. We are committed to respecting our employees' fundamental human rights at work. We similarly expect our suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors and all other third-party companies that comprise EPAM’s supply chain to respect human rights and to avoid complicity in human rights abuses and have adopted a code of conduct for our suppliers and vendors accordingly. 
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex, specialized solutions for our customers. We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all deliverable intellectual property and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or provision of services. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential. 
 8


We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our customers. These customary agreements cover our use of our customers’ software systems and platforms as our customers usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them. Furthermore, we often grant a nonexclusive license to our customers to use our pre-existing intellectual property, but only to the extent necessary to use the software or systems we develop for them.
Regulations
Due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services, our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations. Several foreign and U.S. federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulation and Legislation.” We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including export restrictions, economic sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-corruption laws and data privacy regulations. Compliance with these laws requires significant resources and non-compliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures.
