ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History
 Medicine Man Technologies, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on March 20, 2014. On May 1, 2014, we entered into a non-exclusive Technology License Agreement with Futurevision, Inc., f/k/a Medicine Man Production Corp., dba Medicine Man Denver (“Medicine Man Denver”) pursuant to which Medicine Man Denver granted us a license to use all of the proprietary processes that they had developed, implemented and practiced at their cannabis facilities relating to the commercial growth, cultivation, marketing and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana pursuant to relevant state laws and the right to use and to license such information, including trade secrets, skills and experience (present and future) (the “License Agreement”) for 10 years.
 
In 2017, the Company acquired additional cultivation intellectual property through the acquisition of Success Nutrients™ and Pono Publications, including the rights to the book titled “Three A Light” and its associated cultivation techniques, which have been part of the Company’s products and services offerings since the acquisition. The Company acquired Two J’s LLC d/b/a The Big Tomato (“Big T or The Big Tomato”) in 2018, which operates a retail location in Aurora, Colorado. It has been a leading supplier of hydroponics and indoor gardening supplies in the metro Denver area since May 2001. The Company was focused on cannabis dispensary and cultivation consulting and providing equipment and nutrients to cannabis cultivators until its first plant touching acquisition in April of 2020. In 2019, due to the changes in Colorado law permitting non-Colorado resident and publicly traded investment into “plant-touching” cannabis companies, the Company made a strategic decision to move toward direct plant-touching operations. The Company developed a plan to roll up a number of direct plant-touching dispensaries, manufacturing facilities, and cannabis cultivations with a target to be one of the largest seed to sale cannabis businesses in Colorado. In April 2020, the Company acquired its first plant-touching business, Mesa Organics Ltd. (“Mesa Organics”), which consists of four dispensaries and one manufacturing infused products facility (“MIP”), d/b/a Purplebee’s.
 
On April 20, 2020, the Company rebranded and conducts its business under the trade name, Schwazze. The corporate name of the Company continues to be Medicine Man Technologies, Inc. Effective April 21, 2020, the Company commenced trading under the OTC ticker symbol SHWZ.
 
On December 17, 2020, the Company closed on the acquisition of (i) Starbuds Pueblo LLC; and (ii) Starbuds Alameda LLC. On December 18, 2020, the Company closed on the acquisition of (i) Starbuds Commerce City LLC; (ii) Lucky Ticket LLC; (iii) Starbuds Niwot LLC; and (iv) LM MJC LLC under the applicable APAs.
 
On February 4, 2021, the Company acquired the assets of Colorado Health Consultants LLC and Mountain View 44th LLC under the applicable APAs.
 
On March 2, 2021, the Company acquired the assets of (i) Starbuds Aurora LLC, (ii) SB Arapahoe LLC, (iii) Citi-Med LLC, (iv) Starbuds Louisville LLC and (v) KEW LLC under the applicable APAs.
 
From December 2020 through March 2021 the Company completed a private placement of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”) for aggregate gross proceeds of $57.7 million dollars. In the private placement, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 57,700 shares of Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share under securities purchase agreement with Dye Capital and CRW managed funds as well as subscription agreements with unaffiliated investors. Among other terms, each share of Preferred Stock (i) earns an annual dividend of 8% on the “preference amount,” which initially is equal to the $1,000 per-share purchase price and subject to increase, by having such dividends automatically accrete to, and increase, the outstanding preference amount; (ii) is entitled to a liquidation preference under certain circumstances, (iii) is convertible into shares of the Company’s Common Stock by dividing the preference amount by $1.20 per share under certain circumstances, and (iv) is subject to a redemption right or obligation under certain circumstances.
 
In addition, on December 16, 2020, the Company issued and sold a Convertible Promissory Note and Security Agreement in the original principal amount of $5,000,000 to Dye Capital & Company, LLC. On February 26, 2021, Dye Capital & Company, LLC converted all outstanding amounts under the note into 5,060 shares of Preferred Stock. 
 
The Company is focused on growing through internal growth, acquisition, and new licenses in the Colorado cannabis market. The Company is focused on building the premier vertically integrated cannabis company in Colorado. The company's leadership team has deep expertise in mainstream consumer packaged goods, retail, and product development at Fortune 500 companies as well as in the cannabis sector.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 
Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently directly involved, through our subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry. The Company is directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale, and distribution of cannabis in the adult-use cannabis marketplace in the State of Colorado.
 
The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse; no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp.
 
The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical and recreational uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and consumers. Moreover, as of February 4, 2021 and despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 36 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, although Mississippi’s medical cannabis legalization measure is under challenge. Fifteen of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes, although South Dakota’s adult-use measure is subject to potential challenge. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized marijuana for medical use.
 
Unlike in Canada, which uniformly regulates the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana at the federal level under the Cannabis Act (Canada), marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in Colorado, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us. In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks.
 
Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of Department of Justice memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum. The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard for marijuana-related businesses to comply with. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:

-

 

1. Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
 2. Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
 3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
 4. Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
 6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
 7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
 8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.
 
On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.”
 
On January 21, 2021, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the United States. President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Attorney General Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a useful use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.
 
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
 
As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we abide by the following standard operating policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
 
1. Continuously monitor our operations for compliance with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
 2. Ensure that our cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained;
 3. Implement policies and procedures to prevent the distribution of our cannabis products to minors;
 4. Implement policies and procedures in place to avoid the distribution of the proceeds from our operations to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels;
 5. Implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to reliably track inventory and prevent the diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law,
 or across any state lines in general;
 6. Monitor the operations at our facilities so that our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs or engaging in any other illegal activity; and
 7. Implement quality controls so that our products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to avoid adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and discourage impaired driving.

In order to participate in either the medical or recreational sides of the marijuana industry in Colorado and elsewhere, all businesses and employees must obtain badges and licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions. Colorado issues six types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, transport, research license and testing. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.
 
Colorado has also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of marijuana businesses. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements and product testing for potency and contaminants.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the adult-use marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state, and federal adult-use marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of the date of this Report, we employ 244 full time and 27 part time employees and several specialty contractors providing support for various elements including retail sales in cannabis dispensaries, wholesale sales for our cannabis and non-cannabis products, manufacturing, cultivation, and general corporate.
 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
    COMPETITION
 
As we have expanded our business to cannabis cultivation, manufacturing and retail the number of competitors has increase. There are many competitors in each of these areas in Colorado and throughout the United States. We currently operate in Colorado. At the beginning of 2020 there were 572 retail dispensaries and 438 licensed medical marijuana stores in Colorado.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries will compete with a variety of different operators across the states in which it will operate. In the majority of such states, there are specific license caps that create high barriers to entry. However, in some markets, such as Colorado, there are few caps on licenses creating a more open marketplace. Our most direct competitors within Colorado include a number of operators such as The Green Solution ("TGS"), Native Roots, Green Dragon and LiveWell. The Company also views operators that have vertical operations outside of Colorado as potential strategic competitors related to our growth strategy, including Green Thumb Industries, Inc., iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc., Acreage Holdings, Inc., and Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. Like the Company, these companies can realize centralized synergies to produce higher margins. In addition to operators, we also have a number of manufacturing competitors, including Columbia Care Inc., Craft Concentrates, WHT LBL Cannabis, Colorado Cannabis Company, and Spherex Inc.
 
Additionally, the Company competes with the unregulated black and grey markets. As the regulatory environment continues to be formalized and enforced, management believes there will be a major reduction of these operators.
 
Related to our Consulting and Licensing Services, we currently face competition from an increasing number of consulting service providers in the cannabis industry. There are at least twenty such consulting service providers in the market, not including law firms and other professional entities. We continually conduct competitive analysis, monitor their progress and presence in the industry while we work to maintain a leading position in the industry.

TRADEMARKS - TRADENAMES
 
We rely upon our various trademarks, trade names and intellectual property and will, in the future and as appropriate, develop such elements as we may determine valuable to our business. We also acknowledge that certain protections normally available to us related to design or other utility patents in the cannabis industry would not currently be enforceable under federal law. We attempt to protect our intellectual property via the deployment of non-disclosure agreements with both prospects and licensees. There are no assurances that these non-disclosure agreements will prevent a third party from infringing upon our rights.
 
The Company utilizes a combination of copyright, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary intellectual property. We intend to aggressively register for patent protection if and when the federal government eliminates the cannabis prohibition. Intellectual property counsel has advised that any effort to register a patent relating to the cultivation of marijuana would currently be unsuccessful. (See Item 3).
 
INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
 
Nationally, the marijuana industry has continued to gain ground through the addition of many states and their passing of medical and or recreational provisions for the use of cannabis. While there certainly appears to be a trend towards acceptance of cannabis, there are no assurances offered that this business will be able to sustain itself over time if the Federal Government changes its current position related to state legalized operations.
 
As of February 4, 2021 at least 36 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, although Mississippi’s medical cannabis legalization measure is under challenge. Fifteen of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes, although South Dakota’s adult-use measure is subject to potential challenge. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized marijuana for medical use.
 
While there have been many observations and prognostications relative to the recent elections, there has been no specific laws passed by the federal government to change the federal prohibition of marijuana.
 
Colorado has continued to set new sales growth-related records, generating about $2.22 billion in gross sales in FY 2020; up from the $1.79 billion recorded in FY 2019 noting many of those sales were related to adult use and the robust tourist industry. It is noteworthy that these record sales occurred in a marketplace during lower tourism and COVID-19.
 
While no assurances can be provided, we believe that over the next three to five years there will be many additional states adopting various types of cannabis legislation (medical and/or adult use) and if this happens, we believe that there will occur a certain tipping point by which the Federal Government will have to take some sort of stand on the legal status of cannabis. We also believe that due to the strong growth in the industry as a whole at the state level, the Federal Government will eventually de-schedule cannabis, similar to the alcoholic beverage prohibition repeal in the mid 1930’s, and as motivated by its citizenry, decriminalize cannabis and regulate it under the auspices of some existing or newly formed agency.
