 General
 
Plus Therapeutics is committed to developing and delivering innovative treatments for rare and difficult to treat cancers, with a focus on cancers of the central nervous system. Plus Therapeutics’ mission is to transform the clinical care of cancer patients through its innovative drugs that have the potential to improve survival and quality of life.  
 
Plus has a nanoscale drug development platform and the requisite expertise to innovate and produce product candidates that have the potential to become new and better therapeutics for rare cancers. We believe that this approach will produce investigational drugs that provide unique benefits such as improved mechanism of action, better tumor targeting, improved pharmacokinetics and higher treatment doses to the tumor. Benefits such as these may then improve the overall efficacy of drugs while reducing the side effects associated with more traditional drug delivery methods. To support this goal, Plus Therapeutics has an established, GMP-validated nanoscale drug R&D and commercial scale manufacturing facility in San Antonio, TX. This facility is suited to support our efforts to produce nanoliposomal drug candidates for research, development, clinical and commercial use.
 As part of our strategy to leverage our nanotechnology platform and expertise, we use a simple multi-step model that management believes allows Plus to best address unmet market needs or underserved medical conditions while managing risks and minimizing development costs.  This model includes: (1) market landscape mapping, (2) internal drug redesign, (3) in house drug manufacturing, (4) performance of critical non-clinical (i.e. bench, animal) analyses, (5) scale-up manufacturing for commercial purposes and performance of early-stage clinical trials, and (6) partnering for late-stage clinical trials, regulatory approval, and, ultimately, commercial launch.
 Pipeline
 
Plus Therapeutics currently has four investigational drugs, three of which are at the clinical stage for rare and difficult to treat cancers.  The three clinical stage drugs in our pipeline are:

1) | Rhenium NanoLiposomes (RNL™), a patented radiotherapy for patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) that is currently being evaluated in the U.S. NCI-supported, multi-center ReSPECT™ Phase 1 dose-finding clinical trial;


2) | DocePLUS™, a patented chemotherapy for patients with solid tumors that has been evaluated in a completed U.S. single-center Phase 1 clinical trial; and 


3) | DoxoPLUS™, a generic chemotherapy that has been evaluated in a completed, bioequivalence clinical trial in the U.S., Canada, and Ukraine versus Janssen’s CAELYX® in patients with ovarian cancer.

 In addition, Plus has an early preclinical investigational drug which is a proprietary combination of Rhenium Nanpoliposomes and liposomal doxorubicin. Theoretically, this combination could provide a synergistic combination of both chemotherapy and radiation in a single treatment. 
 
Current business activities related to both DocePLUS and DoxoPLUS are focused on identification of potential partners for these two drugs.
 Plus’ RNL™ technology was a key part of the licensed radiotherapeutic portfolio that we acquired from NanoTx, Corp. (“NanoTx”) on May 7, 2020. The licensed radiolabeled nanoliposome platform can be applied toward several cancer targets and was developed by a multi-institutional consortium based in Texas at the Mays Cancer Center / UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center now led by Dr. Andrew Brenner, MD, PhD, who is the Kolitz Chair in Neuro-Oncology Research and Co-Leader of the Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics Program. The licensed technology was previously funded by both the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT).  Dr. Brenner’s RNL research program has an active $3M award from NIH/NCI which will financially support the continued clinical development of RNL for recurrent glioblastoma through the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial and enrollment of up to 55 patients.

Plus Therapeutics’ lead investigational drug, RNL™, is a novel injectable radiotherapy designed to deliver targeted high dose radiation directly into a brain tumor in a safe, effective, and convenient manner to optimize patient outcomes.  RNL™, which is composed of radionuclide Rhenium-186 (186Re) and a nanoliposomal carrier, is infused directly into the brain tumor via precision brain mapping and convection enhanced delivery.  The RNL radiation dose delivered to patients may be up to 15-20x greater than what is possible with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Some additional potential benefits of RNL compared to EBRT include:
  
- | RNL can be visualized in real-time during administration, possibly giving doctors better control of radiation dosing and distribution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Potentially more effectively treats the bulk tumor and microscopic disease in surrounding healthy tissue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Using a small catheter, RNL is infused directly into the targeted tumor, which may reduce radiation exposure to healthy cells. By contrast, EBRT is less targeted and selective.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | RNL is given during a single 3- to 4-day in-patient hospital visit, while EBRT requires out-patient visits 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) affects approximately 12,000 patients annually in the U.S. and is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer.  The average life expectancy with glioblastoma is less than 24 months, with a one-year survival rate of 40.8% and a five-year survival rate of only 6.8%.  GBM can cause headaches, seizures, vision changes and other neurological complications.  Despite the best available medical treatments to eliminate the initial brain tumor, some microscopic disease frequently remains, with tumor regrowth within months.  In fact, approximately 90% of patients experience tumor recurrence.  This tumor type is incredibly difficult to remove completely, and often is resistant or quickly develops resistance to most available therapies. The treatment of GBM remains a significant challenge and it has been nearly a decade since the FDA approved a new therapy for this disease.  There is no clear standard of care for recurrent GBM and even the few currently approved treatments, in aggregate, provide only marginal survival benefit.  Current approved therapies are associated with significant side effects, which limit dosing and prolonged use.
 By infusing the RNL™ drug directly into the tumor, bypassing the blood-brain barrier, normal brain and external tissues may be spared from radiation damage. We believe that radiation in the form of high energy electrons may be effective against glioblastoma if an adequate dose can be effectively delivered. For comparison, current EBRT protocols for recurrent glioblastoma typically recommend a total maximum dose of about 35 Gy. In contrast, the most recently dosed patient with RNL in our clinical trial received over 500 Gy without significant adverse effects to-date.
 
       RNL is currently being evaluated for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in the Phase 1 multi-center ReSPECT™ dose-finding clinical trial.  ReSPECT is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and distribution of RNL for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.  Thus far, RNL has demonstrated early potential efficacy signals in patients with adequate dosing and tumor coverage with two patients surviving more than 30 months, compared to a median survival of approximately 9 months with the current standard of care.  The sixth dose escalation cohort of this trial has been completed, which increased the RNL drug volume to 8.8 milliliters and radiation dose to 22.3 millicuries.  The increased treatment volume in the sixth cohort will allow treatment of tumors up to approximately 4.5 cm in size, which may include the majority of glioblastoma tumors that appear in the recurrent setting.  No treatment-related SAEs have been observed thus far.  ReSPECT is supported by an award from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).
 
In September 2020, the FDA granted both Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track designation to RNL for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma.
 
Based on substantial preclinical work completed and published, RNL is thought to have potential clinical benefits in other difficult to treat cancers such as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, recurrent head and neck cancer, and pediatric brain cancer.
 Licensing
 
On March 29, 2020, we entered into a Patent and Know-How License Agreement (the “NanoTx License Agreement”) with NanoTx, pursuant to which NanoTx granted us an irrevocable, perpetual, exclusive, fully paid-up license, with the right to sublicense and to make, develop, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain patents, know-how and technology related to the development of radiolabeled nanoliposomes.
 The transaction terms included an upfront payment of $400,000 in cash and $300,000 in our voting stock (the “Equity Compensation”). Furthermore, we may pay up to $136.5 million in development and sales milestone payments and a tiered single-digit royalty on U.S. and European sales.

The licensed drug portfolio is anchored around nanoliposome-encapsulated radionuclides for several cancer targets. The lead drug asset is a chelated RNLTM, initially being developed for recurrent glioblastoma.  RNL is infused directly into the brain tumor via precision brain mapping and convection enhanced delivery technology to deliver very high therapeutic doses of radiation to patients whose cancer has recurred following initial surgical resection and treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.
 
The licensed radiolabeled nanoliposome platform was developed by a multi-institutional consortium based in Texas at the Mays Cancer Center / UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center led by Dr. Andrew Brenner, MD, PhD, who is the Kolitz Chair in Neuro-Oncology Research and Co-Leader of the Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics Program. The technology was previously owned by NanoTx and funded by both the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT).  There is an active $3M award from NIH/NCI which will financially support the continued clinical development of RNL for recurrent glioblastoma.
 Manufacturing 
 
We have a dedicated nanoparticle research & development and commercial scale manufacturing facility located in San Antonio, Texas. The facility and processes are designed to comply with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) per FDA and EMA regulations for the manufacture of drug candidates for clinical, research, development and commercial use. Upon approval of our drug candidates, our manufacturing capabilities will include validated manufacturing processes for the drug product as well as a quality assurance product release process with the ability to ultimately scale-up the process to meet increasing market demands. We believe our strategic investments in the analytical and manufacturing capabilities, including personnel with expertise from drug discovery through drug development, will allow us to advance our product candidates more quickly. Expertise gained in manufacturing our drug products may be applied to other formulations in the future, further leveraging our capabilities. Our San Antonio facility enables us to produce drug substances in a cost-effective manner while retaining control over the process and timing. As needed, the use of a qualified Contract Drug Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) may be utilized to perform various manufacturing processes as we deem appropriate to meet our operational objectives.  In addition, we have entered into master services agreements with third parties, including Piramal Pharma Solutions, Inc. (“Piramal”), in connection with the manufacture of RNL.  The master services agreement with Piramal (the “Piramal MSA”) was entered into on January 8, 2021.  The Piramal MSA provides for Piramal to perform certain services related to the development, manufacture, and supply of our RNL-Liposome Intermediate Drug Product. The Piramal MSA includes the transfer of analytical methods, development of microbiological methods, process transfer and optimization, intermediate drug product manufacturing, and stability studies for us.  The transfer will be performed at Piramal’s facility located in Lexington, Kentucky.  The parties contemplate that the MSA will lead to clinical and commercial supply agreements between us and Piramal.  The Piramal MSA has a term of five years and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party notifies the other no later than six months prior to the original term or any additional terms of its intention to not renew the Piramal MSA.  We have the right to terminate the Piramal MSA for convenience upon thirty days’ prior written notice.  Either party may terminate the Piramal MSA upon an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. 
Competition 
 We will compete primarily on the basis of the safety and efficacy of our therapies across a broad range of clinical indications to address significant unmet medical and market needs, supported by our brand name, pricing, products, published clinical data, regulatory approvals, and reimbursement. We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to:

• | develop and innovate our product and technology platforms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | initiate new and advance existing clinical development programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | secure and maintain regulatory agency approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | build and expand our commercial footprint;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | produce high quality products per our specifications and in line with customer expectations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | achieve improved economies of scale;
--+-------------------------------------


• | generate and protect intellectual property;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | hire and retain key talent; and
--+--------------------------------


• | successfully execute acquisition, licensing, and partnership activities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Competition for RNL™ in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma may come from a single or combination therapy in the future.  Bayer, VBL Therapeutics, Kintara Therapeutics, Istari Oncology, Medicenna, MediciNova, Oncoceutics, PharmAbcine, VBI Vaccines, Ziopharm Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb, ImmunoCellular, Novartis, EnGeneIC, Berg, Bexion, and others have reported drug development programs at various clinical stages for recurrent glioblastoma and Plus Therapeutics continues to monitor their progress.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others.
 
We license the proprietary formulation and proprietary methods of manufacture of the nanoliposome-encapsulated radionucleotides.  RNL™ is covered by U.S. Patent No. 7,718,160, (the ‘160 Patent) which will expire in December 2026. Patent term extension, codified in 35 U.S.C. §156, provides a means of recapturing time lost during the regulatory approval process.  Based upon this regulation, we will apply for patent term extension for the ‘160 Patent for the time equal to the regulatory review period for RNL™.  This has the potential to extend patent coverage for this product for at least another 5 years. The ‘160 Patent covers the method of manufacture of RNL™ and product-by-process claims.  Our patent family also contains granted patents in Canada (Patent No. 2,490,959), Europe (Patent No. EP1536843), and Australia (Patent No. 2003241598), which are expected to expire in May 2023.  We are not aware of any valid patent claims that would be infringed by RNL™.
 
We also own U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/115,519, titled Radiolabeled Liposomes and Methods of Use Thereof, which is directed to methods of treating cancer comprising administering 186Re nanoliposomes via convection-enhanced delivery.  This application was filed on November 18, 2020, and any issued patents resulting from this application are expected to expire in November 2041, not including any patent term adjustment or patent term extension. 
 
In addition, we own the proprietary formulation and proprietary methods of manufacture of a protein-stabilized liposomal form of docetaxel, DocePLUS.  DocePLUS is covered by U.S. Patent No. 7,179,484, (the ‘484 Patent) which will expire in April 2024. Patent term extension, codified in 35 U.S.C. §156, provides a means of recapturing time lost during the regulatory approval process.  Based upon this regulation, we will apply for patent term extension for the ‘484 Patent for the time equal to the regulatory review period for DocePLUS.  This has the potential to extend patent coverage for this product for at least another 10 years. The ‘484 Patent covers the method of manufacture of DocePLUS and product-by-process claims.  We filed Provisional Patent Application No. 62/542,993 with the USPTO in August 2017.  This was converted to a PCT application (US2018/045339) in August 2018 (the ‘339 application). The ‘339 Application covers methods of treating refractory small cell lung cancer with DocePLUS and may provide protection until 2037 in the U.S. and worldwide. We are not aware of any valid patent claims that would be infringed by the DocePLUS product, or methods of using the same in the treatment of refractory small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel is a well-known and widely-administered drug that has been off-patent in the U.S. since 2010. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Our nanoparticle oncology drug products must receive regulatory approvals from the EMA and the FDA and from other applicable governments prior to their sale.
 FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements 
 8 


typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of some preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support drug products for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug product into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug product. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, a drug product is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the drug product is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The drug product must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a drug product is substantial. The submission of most drug products is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved drug product is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a drug candidate to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of drug candidates. Most such applications for standard review are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the drug candidate; most applications for priority review are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the drug candidate. Priority review can be applied to a drug candidate that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether 
 9 


the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a drug candidate, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the drug candidate contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug candidate is safe, pure, potent and effective in the intended indication.
 After the FDA evaluates the drug candidate and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the drug candidate, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug candidate with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug candidate outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new drug candidate or drug candidate supplement before the change can be implemented. A drug candidate supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing drug candidate supplements as it does in reviewing drug candidates.
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drug candidates that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Under the fast track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug candidate for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug candidate from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the IND is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 10 


The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drug candidate products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidate products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a IND. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first IND applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a drug product containing the same principal molecular structural features for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the IND user fee.
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application.
 A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or IND for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA or IND must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA or IND must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by the FDA; and the NDA or IND must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA or IND approval, the FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher.
 To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of the NDA or IND, of its intent to request a voucher. If the FDA determines that the NDA or IND is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA or IND is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA or IND a voucher upon approval of the NDA or IND. The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval.
 The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or IND and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or IND. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify the FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or IND at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or IND and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee. The FDA must take action on an NDA or IND under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or IND.
 The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized in the 21st Century Cures Act, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to October 1, 2020 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or IND prior to October 1, 2022.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information

Sponsors of clinical trials of the FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by statute or regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted; however, beginning in 2020, PREA will apply to INDs for orphan-designated drugs if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA has determined is substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
Patent Term Restoration
 After approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND application and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 12 


The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, we will also be required to report on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and 
 13 


future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 The ACA has substantially changed some aspects of healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA has affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
 Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs, that began in 2011;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14 




 
• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On January 20, 2017, federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA were directed to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. More recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law in December 2017, which eliminated certain requirements of the ACA, including the individual mandate, and plans to repeal all or portions of the ACA have also been suggested. We cannot predict whether these challenges will continue or whether other proposals will be made or adopted, or what impact these efforts may have on us.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 15 


To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the drug product in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had twelve full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, six were engaged in research and development, and six were engaged in management, finance and administration. From time to time, we also employ independent contractors to support our operations. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We are committed to our continued efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment. We recruit the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity, or other protected traits and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws (domestic and foreign) applicable to discrimination in the workplace. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our executive leadership team.
Workforce Health and Safety
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we instituted a remote work protocol to help ensure the safety of our employees, our community, and to adhere to federal, state, and local requirements and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations of social distancing and limited public exposure in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not implement any furlough, layoff, or salary reductions during this time. We continue to evaluate our ability to operate in light of recent resurgences of COVID-19 and the advisability of continuing operations based on federal, state and local guidance, evolving data concerning the pandemic and the best interests of our employees, third parties with whom we collaborate, and our stockholders.
Compensation and Benefits
 
We believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition to cash compensation, we provide equity compensation, a company-matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.

Item 1. Financial Statements
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
Shareholders and Board of Directors
Plus Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Austin, Texas 
 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Plus Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) (formerly Cytori Therapeutics, Inc.) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern Uncertainty
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
Critical Audit Matters
 
The critical audit matter communicated below is matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee of the Company’s board of directors and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Classification of Warrants
 
As described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, between April and September 2020, the Company entered into revised warrant agreements with the holders of the Series U warrants. In return for reducing the strike price of the warrants, the 
 52 


warrant holders agreed to amend certain settlement provisions such that the warrants would meet the requirements to be classified within stockholders’ equity. As a result, the Company reclassified the fair value of the Series U warrant liability of approximately $4.5 million to stockholders' equity at the date of modification.
 
We identified the classification of warrants as a critical audit matter. The assessment of the warrants’ classification involves an evaluation of the relevant terms and provisions of the warrant contract to determine the accounting guidance to be applied in the recognition of the warrants in the consolidated financial statements. The accounting guidance surrounding the classification of warrants is complex and therefore, applying such guidance to the contract terms is subjective and requires significant judgment. Auditing management’s conclusions related to this matter involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills and knowledge needed.
 
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
 
Utilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in technical accounting to assist in assessing management’s analysis over the warrant classification including: (i) evaluating the revised warrant contracts to identify relevant terms that affect the recognition in the consolidated financial statements, and (ii) assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by management.

PLUS THERAPEUTICS, INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 DECEMBER 31, 2020
  
1. | Organization and Operations
---+----------------------------

The Company
 Plus Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of complex and innovative treatments for patients battling cancer and other life-threatening diseases.
 Principles of Consolidation
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 Up to the sale transactions as described below, the Company had five wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Japan, United Kingdom, Switzerland, India and Spain that have been established primarily to support our sales and marketing activities in these regions. 
 On March 30, 2019, the Company entered into an Asset and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Lorem Purchase Agreement”) with Lorem Vascular Pte. Ltd. (“Lorem”), pursuant to which, among other things, Lorem agreed to purchase the Company’s UK subsidiary, Cytori Ltd. (the “UK Subsidiary”), and the Company’s cell therapy assets (the “Cell Therapy Assets”), excluding such assets used in Japan or relating to the Company’s contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”). Both the Company and Lorem made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Lorem Purchase Agreement. The transaction was completed on April 24, 2019 and the Company received $4.0 million of cash proceeds, of which $1.7 million was used to pay down principal, interest and fees under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated May 29, 2015 (the “Loan and Security Agreement”), with Oxford Finance, LLC (“Oxford”).
 On April 19, 2019, the Company entered into an Asset and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Shirahama Purchase Agreement”) with Seijirō Shirahama, pursuant to which, among other things, Mr. Shirahama agreed to purchase the Company’s Japanese subsidiary, Cytori Therapeutics, K.K. (the “Japanese Subsidiary”), and substantially all of the Company’s Cell Therapy assets used in Japan. Both the Company and Mr. Shirahama made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Shirahama Purchase Agreement. The transaction was completed on April 25, 2019 and the Company received $3.0 million of cash proceeds, of which $1.4 million was used to pay down principal, interest and fees under the Loan and Security Agreement (defined in Note 4).
 
Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation and Reverse Stock Split
 On July 29, 2019, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware to change its corporate name from Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. to Plus Therapeutics, Inc. The Company also changed its trading symbol for its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market to “PSTV”.
 On August 5, 2019, following stockholder and Board approval, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effectuate a one-for-fifty (1:50) reverse stock split of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, without any change to its par value. Proportional adjustments for the reverse stock split were made to the Company's outstanding stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans for all periods presented.
 Certain Risks and Uncertainties
 The Company’s prospects are subject to the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development and commercialization, especially those companies in rapidly evolving and technologically advanced industries such as the biotech/medical device field. The Company’s future viability largely depends on its ability to complete development of new products and receive regulatory approvals for those products. No assurance can be given that the Company’s new products will be successfully developed, regulatory approvals will be granted, or acceptance of these products will be achieved.
Liquidity and Going Concern
 The Company incurred net losses of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $433.5 million and cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. Additionally, the 
 58


Company used net cash of $8.4 million to fund its operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, as discussed in Note 13, the full magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and future results of operations is uncertain. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
On October 23, 2020, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Canaccord Genuity LLC (“Canaccord”), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $10,000,000 (the “ATM Shares”), depending on market demand, with Canaccord acting as an agent for sales. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the ATM Shares. The Company may instruct Canaccord not to sell the ATM Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price the Company designates from time to time and the Company may at any time suspend sales pursuant to the Distribution Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 1,616,299 shares of its common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $3.2 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company issued 536,070 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.5 million. 
 On September 30, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “2020 Purchase Agreement”) and registration rights agreement pursuant to which Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC (“Lincoln Park”) has committed to purchase up to $25.0 million of the Company’s common stock. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $25.0 million of the Company’s common stock. Such sales of common stock by the Company, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at the Company’s sole discretion, over the 36-month period commencing on the date that the registration statement covering the resale of shares of common stock that have been and may be issued under the 2020 Purchase Agreement, is declared effective by the SEC and a final prospectus in connection therewith is filed. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold 353,113 shares, excluding 180,701 shares issued as commitment fee, of common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of $0.7 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company issued 985,186 shares of its common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for total proceeds of $2.9 million. 
 In September 2019, the Company finalized the indirect cost rate under the contract we were awarded in September 2012 with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “BARDA Agreement”), for indirect costs incurred during the years 2012 through 2019, which resulted in approximately $4.6 million of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.
 
In September 2019, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the “Representative”), as representative of the underwriters (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which the Company sold in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of (i) 289,000 Class A Units, each consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company and one Series U warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (ii) 2,711,000 Class B Units, each consisting of one pre-funded Series V warrant to purchase one share of common stock and one Series U Warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per Class A Unit and $4.9999 per Class B Unit (the “September 2019 Offering”). In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 450,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and/or Series U Warrants at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions.  The Underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 450,000 Series U warrants. The Company also issued to the Representative warrants (in the form of the Series U warrants) to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $6.25 per share of common stock (the “Representative Warrants”).
 On April 24, 2019, the Company received $3.3 million of net cash proceeds related to the sale of the UK Subsidiary and the Cell Therapy Assets (excluding such assets used in Japan or relating to the Company’s contract with BARDA), of which $1.7 million was used to pay down principal, interest and fees on the Loan and Security Agreement, and on April 25, 2019 the Company received $2.4 million of net cash proceeds related to the sale of the Japanese Subsidiary, and substantially all of the Company’s Cell Therapy assets used in Japan, of which $1.4 million was used to pay down principal, interests and fees on the Loan and Security Agreement.
 



The Company continues to seek additional capital through strategic transactions and from other financing alternatives. Without additional capital, the Company’s current working capital will not provide adequate funding to make debt repayments or support its research, and product development activities at their current levels. If sufficient capital is not raised, the Company will at a minimum need to significantly reduce or curtail its research and development and other operations, and this would negatively affect its ability to achieve corporate growth goals.
 
Should the Company fail to raise additional cash from outside sources, this would have a material adverse impact on its operations.
 59


The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern.
  
2. | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
---+-------------------------------------------

Use of Estimates
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  The most significant estimates and critical accounting policies involve reviewing assets for impairment, determining the assumptions used in measuring share-based compensation expense, valuing warrants and valuing allowances for doubtful accounts.
 Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management’s estimates and assumptions are reviewed regularly, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods they are determined to be necessary.
 Cash and cash equivalents
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in readily available checking and savings accounts. The Company held no investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant risk on its cash balances due to the financial position of the depository institution in which those deposits are held. 
 Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash consists of cash invested in certificate of deposits used as collateral for the issuance of letters of credit pursuant to lease agreements for leasing of property at 3020 and 3030 Callan Road, San Diego, CA, which required us to execute a letter of credit for $40,000 naming the landlord as a beneficiary as of December 31, 2019. There was no restricted cash as of December 31, 2020.
Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. As of December 31, 2019, accounts receivable represents outstanding invoices under the BARDA Agreement for work performed prior to the BARDA contract termination. There were no accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020. 
Financial Instruments 
 Financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities and long-term debt. The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities generally approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Based on level 3 inputs and the borrowing rates current available for loans with similar terms, the Company believes the fair value the long-term debt approximates its carrying value. 
 60



Property and Equipment
 Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of capitalized leasehold improvements, is provided for on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter, and range from three to five years. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is included in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Impairment
 The Company assesses its property and equipment for potential impairment when there is a change in circumstances that indicates carrying values of assets may not be recoverable. Such long-lived assets are deemed to be impaired when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (or asset group) are less than the asset’s carrying amount. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating expense.  The Company recognized no impairment losses during any of the periods presented in these financial statements.
Goodwill 
 The Company’s goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from its business combinations. The determination of the value of goodwill arising from business combinations requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. 
 Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
 The Company performs its impairment test annually during the fourth quarter by comparing the Company’s estimated fair value, calculated from the Company’s market capitalization, to its carrying amount. The Company’s annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill consists of one reporting unit. The Company completed its most recent annual evaluation for impairment as of December 31, 2020 and determined that no impairment existed. Warrant Liability
 
Warrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative accounting guidance as either liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the agreements. Liability-classified instruments are recorded at fair value at each reporting period with any change in fair value recognized as a component of change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
Revenue Recognition 
 Development Revenue
 The Company earns revenue for performing tasks under research and development agreements with governmental agencies like BARDA. Revenue derived from reimbursement of direct out-of-pocket expenses for research costs associated with government contracts are recorded as government contract and other within development revenue.  Government contract revenue is recorded at the gross amount of the reimbursement.  The costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in our statements of operations.  The Company recognized $0.3 million and $7.0 million in BARDA revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 The BARDA Agreement was terminated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services effective in December 2019 and the contract close out process was completed during 2020.
 61


Concentration of Significant Customers & Geographical Sales
 After the Company sold its Cell Therapy business, BARDA accounted for 100% of our revenue from continuing operations which are recognized for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and accounted for 100% of total outstanding accounts receivable presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Research and Development
 Research and development expenditures, which are charged to operations in the period incurred, include costs associated with the design, development, testing and enhancement of the Company’s products, regulatory fees, the purchase of laboratory supplies, and pre-clinical and clinical studies as well as salaries and benefits for our research and development employees.
 Also included in research and development expenditures are costs incurred to support the government reimbursement contract, including $0.3 million and $1.5 million qualified expenses that were incurred for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, related to the BARDA Agreement.
 Deferred Financing Costs and Other Debt-Related Costs
 Deferred financing costs are capitalized, recorded as an offset to debt balances and amortized to interest expense over the term of the associated debt instrument using the effective interest method.  If the maturity of the debt is accelerated because of default or early debt repayment, then the amortization would be accelerated.
Income Taxes
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income (loss) in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Due to our history of losses, a full valuation allowance has been recognized against our deferred tax assets.
 The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalties related to income tax matters. The Company does not foresee any material changes to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.
 Share-Based Compensation
 The Company recognizes the fair value of all share-based payment awards in our statements of operations over the requisite vesting period of each award, which approximates the period during which the employee and non-employee director is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The Company estimates the fair value of these options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using assumptions for expected volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rate.  Expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility and is computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the options. The expected term is calculated based on historical data for and applied to all employee awards as a single group as the Company does not expect (nor does historical data suggest) substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population. The risk-free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury instruments with maturities that approximate the expected term.
 Segment Information
 For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company is managed as a single operating segment, therefore we report our results in one operating segment.
 Loss Per Share
 Basic per share data is computed by dividing net income or loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted per share data is computed by dividing net income or loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased to include, if dilutive, the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding as calculated using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares were related entirely to outstanding but unexercised options, warrants and convertible preferred stocks for all periods presented.
 The Company excluded all potentially dilutive securities from the calculation of diluted loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as their inclusion would be antidilutive.  
 62


Reclassification
 Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
Recently Issued and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren’t measured at fair value through net income. For available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to recognize an allowance for credit losses rather than a reduction in carrying value of the asset. Entities will no longer be permitted to consider the length of time that fair value has been less than amortized cost when evaluating when credit losses should be recognized. This new guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2023 for calendar-year SEC filers that are smaller reporting companies as of the one-time determination date. Early adoption is permitted beginning in 2019. The Company plans to adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2023, and it does not expect that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
 In August 2020, the FASB issued ​ASU No. 2020-06​, ​Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)​ (“ASU 2020-06”). ​ASU 2020-06 eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity’s own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, ASU 2020-06 modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements.
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13 (ASU 2018-13), Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements as part of its disclosure framework project. The standard is effective for all entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020, which did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

 Fair value measurements are market-based measurements, not entity-specific measurements.  Therefore, fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  We follow a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values.  The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below:
  
• | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in active markets.

Warrants issued by the Company in connection with the 2018 Rights Offering in July 2018 (“Series T Warrants”) and in the September 2019 Offering (“Series U Warrants”) were classified as liabilities at issuance. The Series T and Series U warrants were marked to market at each subsequent reporting date through as non-operating income or loss in the statement of operations. As described in more detail in Note 12, during 2020 the Company amended the terms of 3,522,500 Series U Warrants such that those amended Series U Warrants met the requirements to be classified within stockholders’ equity and were no longer required to be re-measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
 
Expected volatility was computed using daily pricing observations of traded shares of the Company for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the warrants. The Company believes this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants. The Company currently has no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility. The expected life is based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury bond rate as of the valuation date. Because some of the inputs to our valuation model are either not observable or are not derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, the warrant liability is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fluctuations in the fair value of the warrants are impacted by unobservable inputs. Significant increases (decreases) in this input in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 
 
The Series T Warrants are not traded in an active securities market, and as such the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was determined by using an option pricing model with the following assumptions. All outstanding Series T warrants expired unexercised in January 2021. 
 
 
 | As of December 31, 2020 | | | As of December 31, 2019 | 
-----------------------------------+-------------------------+------+---+-------------------------+--

Expected volatility | | 57 | % | | | 168 | %
Resulting fair value (per warrant) | $ | 0.05 | | | $ | 1.47 | 

 
The Company estimated the fair value of the liability-classified Series U Warrants on the issuance date as well as at each subsequent balance sheet date with the Black Scholes model. The assumptions used in the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the Series U warrants were as follows:
 
 
 | As of December 31, 2020 | | | As of December 31, 2019 | 
-----------------------------------+-------------------------+-------+---+-------------------------+--

On September 30, 2020, the Company committed to issue 180,701 shares to Lincoln Park as a committee fee (“Commitment Shares”) in connection with the 2020 Purchase Agreement, and these shares were issued on October 2, 2020. The change in fair value of the Commitment Shares between September 30, 2020 and the issuance date, in the amount of $18,000 and calculated using the closing stock prices on respective dates, was recorded in change in fair value of liability-classified instruments on the statement of operations and comprehensive income/loss.

Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities
 The Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis, if and when necessary, associated with: (1) valuing potential impairment losses related to goodwill which are accounted for pursuant to the authoritative guidance for intangibles—goodwill and other; and (2) valuing potential impairment losses related to long-lived assets which are accounted for pursuant to the authoritative guidance for property, plant and equipment.

7. | Commitments and Contingencies
---+------------------------------

Leases
 At the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether the contract contains a lease by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company calculates the associated lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset upon lease commencement using a discount rate based on the rate implicit in the lease or an incremental borrowing rate commensurate with the term of the lease.
 The Company records lease liabilities within current liabilities or long-term liabilities based upon the length of time associated with the lease payments. The Company records its operating lease right-of-use assets as long-term assets. Right-of-use assets for financing leases are recorded within property and equipment, net in the Balance Sheet. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Balance Sheet. Instead, the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In connection with certain operating leases, the Company has security deposits recorded and maintained as restricted cash totaling $40 thousand as of December 31, 2019. There was no security deposit as of December 31, 2020. 
 The Company leases laboratory, office and storage facilities in San Antonio, Texas, under operating lease agreements that expire in 2028. The Company also leases certain office space in Austin, Texas under a month-to-month operating lease agreement. In addition, the Company leases certain equipment under various operating and finance leases. The lease agreements      generally provide for periodic rent increases, and renewal and termination options. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material variable lease payments, residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
 Certain leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Payments for the transfer of goods or services such as common area maintenance and utilities represent non-lease components. The Company elected the package of practical expedients and therefore does not separate non-lease components from lease components.

 Other commitments
 The Company has entered into agreements with various research organizations for pre-clinical and clinical development studies, which have provisions for cancellation. Under the terms of these agreements, the vendors provide a variety of services including conducting research, recruiting and enrolling patients, monitoring studies and data analysis. Payments under these agreements typically include fees for services and reimbursement of expenses. The timing of payments due under these agreements is estimated based on current study progress.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any clinical research study obligations.   
 

The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings.  Due to their nature, such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions.  Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate.  
 
The Company is currently engaged in a dispute with a third party arising out of its sale of certain assets pursuant to an asset and equity purchase agreement entered into in 2019 (the "APA").  In October 2020, the Company received correspondence from such third party informing it of an alleged breach of certain representations and warranties in the APA and asserting indemnification claims.  In December 2020, the Company responded to the third party and asserted that its improper use of the Company’s intellectual property constituted a breach of the APA and further asserted an indemnification claim against the third party for the Company’s losses in connection therewith. While management believe the claims asserted against the Company to be spurious and without merit, this dispute remains ongoing and there can be no assurance that it will not result in litigation. Resolution of this matter or any resulting litigation would be expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is uncertain. I
t is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the 
range of 
possible loss. 
  
8. | Term Loan Obligations
---+----------------------

 On May 29, 2015, the Company entered into the Loan and Security Agreement, pursuant to which Oxford funded an aggregate principal amount of $17.7 million (the “Term Loan”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement. The Term Loan accrues interest at a floating rate of at least 8.95% per annum, comprised of a three-month LIBOR rate with a floor of 1.00% plus 7.95%.  Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, the Company is required to make interest only payments through May 1, 2021 and thereafter it is required to make payments of principal and accrued interest in equal monthly installments sufficient to amortize the Term Loan through September 1, 2024, the maturity date. At maturity of the Term Loan, or earlier repayment in full following voluntary prepayment or upon acceleration, the Company is required to make a final payment in an aggregate amount equal to approximately $3.2 million. In connection with the Term Loan, on May 29, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford warrants to purchase an aggregate of 188 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5,175 per share. These warrants became exercisable as of November 30, 2015 and will expire on May 29, 2025 and, following the authoritative accounting guidance, are equity classified and its respective fair value was recorded as a discount to the debt.
 From September 2017 to March 2019, the Company entered into a total of seven amendments to the Term Loan which, amongst other things, extended the interest only period, required repayment of $3.1 million using the proceeds received from sale of the Company’s former UK and Japan subsidiaries as described in Note 1, increased the final payment, increased the final payment fee upon maturity or early repayment of the Term Loan, and increased the minimum liquidity covenant level to $2.0 million.
 69


On March 29, 2020, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment of the Loan and Security Agreement (“Ninth Amendment”), pursuant to which Oxford agreed to defer the start date of principal repayment from May 1, 2020 to May 1, 2021 and extended the term of the Term loan from September 1, 2021 to September 1, 2024.  In addition, pursuant to the Ninth Amendment, on April 1, 2020, the Company made a $5.0 million paydown of principal upon execution of the Ninth Amendment and $0.3 million of related final payment. After giving effect to this payment, $4.3 million of principal remains outstanding under the Loan Agreement. In addition, an amendment fee of $1.0 million will be payable in connection with the Amendment at the earlier of the maturity date, acceleration of the loans and the making of certain prepayments. All other major terms remained consistent.

Under authoritative guidance, the Ninth Amendment does not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring. In addition, the Company performed a quantitative analysis and determined that the terms of the new debt and original debt instrument are not substantially different. Accordingly, the Ninth Amendment is accounted for as debt modification. A new effective interest rate that equates the revised cash flows to the carrying amount of the original debt is computed and applied prospectively.
 The Term Loan, as amended, is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s existing and subsequently acquired assets, including its intellectual property assets, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended. The intellectual property asset collateral will be released upon the Company achieving a certain liquidity level when the total principal outstanding under the Loan and Security Agreement is less than $3 million. As of December 31, 2020, there was $4.3 million principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan, excluding the $3.2 million final payment fee, and the Company was in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Loan and Security Agreement.
 The Company’s interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest method, therefore it is inclusive of non-cash amortization in the amount of $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the amortization of the debt discount, capitalized loan costs, and accretion of final payment.
 The Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, contains customary indemnification obligations and customary events of default, including, among other things, the Company’s failure to fulfill certain obligations under the Term Loan, as amended, and the occurrence of a material adverse change, which is defined as a material adverse change in the Company’s business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise), a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of any portion of the loan. In the event of default by the Company or a declaration of material adverse change by its lender, under the Term Loan, the lender would be entitled to exercise its remedies thereunder, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which the Company may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the Term Loan, which could materially harm the Company’s financial condition. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not received any notification or indication from Oxford to invoke the material adverse change clause. However, due to the Company’s current cash flow position and the substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, the entire principal amount of the Term Loan is presented as short-term. The Company will continue to evaluate the debt classification on a quarterly basis and evaluate for reclassification in the future should its financial condition improve. 
 Additional details relating to the outstanding Term Loan as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the following table (in thousands):

The Company has established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. At such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance of $104.8 million as of December 31, 2020 as it does not believe it is more likely than not our net deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company increased its valuation allowance by approximately $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.
 At December 31, 2020, we had federal, and state tax loss carry forwards of approximately $396.2 million, and $173.7 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in 2021 and 2028, respectively, if unused. The federal net operating loss carryover includes $33.6 million of net operating losses generated in 2019. Federal net operating losses generated from 2018 onwards carryover indefinitely and may generally be used to offset up to 80% of future taxable income. At December 31, 2020, we had federal and state tax credit carry forwards of approximately $6.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively, after reduction for uncertain tax positions. The Company has not performed a formal research and development credit study with respect to these credits.  The federal credits will begin to expire in 2021, if unused, and the state credits carry forward indefinitely. 
 Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) of 1986, as amended, specifically IRC §382 and IRC §383, The Company’s ability to use net operating loss and R&D tax credit carry forwards (“tax attribute carry forwards”) to offset future taxable income is limited if we experience a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year testing period. The Company has not completed an ownership change analysis pursuant to IRC Section 382 for taxable years ended after December 31, 2007. If ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 are identified as having occurred subsequent to 2007, the amount of remaining tax attribute carry forwards available to offset future taxable income and income tax expense in future years may be significantly restricted or eliminated.  Further, the Company’s deferred tax assets associated with such tax attributes could be significantly reduced upon realization of an ownership change within the meaning of IRC §382.

The Company follows the provisions of income tax guidance which provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The guidance requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are then measured using a probability weighted approach recognizing the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company has not recognized any liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 Following is a tabular reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
 
 
 | 2020 | | | 2019 | 
------------------------------------------------+------+-------+---+------+--
Unrecognized Tax Benefits – Beginning | $ | 2,234 | | | $ | 2,216 | 
Gross decreases – tax positions in prior period | | (44 | ) | | | (18 | )
Gross increase – current-period tax positions | | 33 | | | | 36 | 
Unrecognized Tax Benefits – Ending | $ | 2,223 | | | $ | 2,234 | 

 
The unrecognized tax benefit amounts are reflected in the determination of the Company’s deferred tax assets. If recognized, none of these amounts would affect the Company’s effective tax rate, since it would be offset by an equal reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  The Company does not foresee material changes to its liability for uncertain tax benefits within the next twelve months.
 The Company did not recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses as of December 31, 2020.
 The Company’s material tax jurisdictions are the United States and California. To its knowledge, the Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.
 The Company’s tax years for 2016 (federal) and 2015 (CA) remain open to examination by the taxing authority.  While not open to examination, the tax attributes generated in tax years 1998 (federal) and 1997 (CA) and forward are subject to adjustment by the taxing authorities if utilized in tax years which are still open to examination.  
  
10. | Employee Benefit Plan
----+----------------------

 We implemented a 401(k) retirement savings and profit sharing plan (the “Plan”) effective January 1, 1999. We may make discretionary annual contributions to the Plan, which is allocated to the profit sharing accounts based on the number of years of employee service and compensation. At the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, we may also match the participants’ contributions to the Plan. We made no discretionary or matching contributions to the Plan in 2020 or 2019.
 11.      NanoTx License Agreement
  On March 29, 2020, the Company and NanoTx, Corp. (“NanoTx”) entered into a Patent and Know-How License Agreement (the“NanoTx License Agreement”), pursuant to which NanoTx granted the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, exclusive, fully paid-up license, with the right to sublicense and to make, develop, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain patents, know-how and technology related to the development of radiolabeled nanoliposomes.
 On May 7, 2020, all closing conditions under the NanoTx License Agreement were satisfied and the Company paid an upfront payment of $400,000 in cash and issued 230,769 shares of its common stock to NanoTx. Cash and the fair value of common stock issued totaled $781,000 and is recorded as in-process research and development expenses, pursuant to authoritative literature for asset acquisition, in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, .  Pursuant to the terms of the NanoTx License Agreement, the Company may be required to pay up to $136.5 million in development and sales milestone payments and a tiered single-digit royalty on U.S. and European sales. 
 12. Stockholders’ Equity
 Preferred Stock
 The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate the terms and conditions of any preferred stock the Company issues without further action by the common stockholders.  There were no shares of Series A 3.6% Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. There were 1,016 and 1,021 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of each of 
 73


December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. There were 938 shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, there were 938 outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock that can be converted into an aggregate of 416,889 shares of common stock, and 1,016 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that can be converted into an aggregate of 6,096 shares of common stock.  On September 25, 2019, in connection with the September 2019 Offering, the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock was reduced from $7.50 to $3.2132. In April 2020, in connection with the Warrant Amendments (defined below), the conversion price of the Series C Preferred Stock was reduced from $3.2132 per share to $2.25 per share.
 

Warrants 
 
On April 27, 2018, the Company registered and distributed to holders of its common stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, at no charge, non-transferable subscription rights to purchase up to an aggregate of 20,000 units for $1,000 a unit. Each unit consisted of one share of Series C Preferred Stock and 1,050 warrants (“Series T Warrants”). Pursuant to the rights offering the 2018 Rights Offering, the Company sold an aggregate of 6,723 units, resulting in total net proceeds to the Company of approximately $5.7 million. In April 2020, in connection with Warrant Amendments (defined below), the exercise price of the Series T Warrants was further adjusted such that every 50 warrants can be exercised into one share of common stock for $2.25.
 As of December 31, 2020, there were 3,787,350 outstanding Series T Warrants which can be exercised into in aggregate 75,747 shares of common stock. All Series T Warrants expired unexercised in January 2021.
 On September 25, 2019, the Company completed an underwritten public offering. The Company issued 289,000 shares of its common stock, along with pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,711,000 shares of its common stock and Series U Warrants to purchase 3,450,000 shares of its common stock at $5.00 per share. The Series U Warrants have a term of five years from the issuance date. In addition, the Company issued warrants to H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, to purchase 75,000 shares of its common stock at $6.25 per share with a term of 5 years from the issuance date, in the form of Series U Warrants (the “Representative Warrants”).
 In accordance with authoritative guidance, the pre-funded warrants are classified as equity. The Series U Warrants and the Representative Warrants are classified at issuance as liabilities due to a contingent obligation for the Company to settle the Series U Warrants with cash upon certain change in control events.
 Between April and September 2020, the Company entered into revised warrant agreements with the holders of 3,447,500 Series U Warrants (“Warrant Amendments”). In return for reducing the strike price of the warrants to $2.25 per share, the warrant holders agreed to amend the settlement provisions upon a fundamental transaction such that the warrants would meet the requirements to be classified within stockholders’ equity. In September 2020, the Company entered into revised warrant agreements for the Representative Warrants that reduced the strike price of the warrants to $2.81 per share, and the warrant holders agreed to amend the settlement provisions upon a fundamental transaction such that the Representative Warrants would meet the requirements to be classified within stockholders’ equity. Accordingly, approximately $4.5 million of warrant liability was reclassified to stockholders’ equity on the respective effective date of the Warrant Amendments. In addition, approximately $0.7 million of other income representing change in the fair value of amended warrants from April 1, 2020 to the respective effective date of the Warrant Amendments is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 As of December 31, 2020, there were 3,037,500 outstanding Series U Warrants which can be exercised into an aggregate of 3,037,500 shares of common stock.
 Common Stock
 Lincoln Park Purchase Agreements 
 
On September 21, 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “2018 Purchase Agreement”) with Lincoln Park pursuant to which the Company had the right to sell to Lincoln Park and Lincoln Park was obligated to purchase up to $5.0 million of shares of the Company’s common stock over the 24-month period following October 15, 2018. Through December 31, 2018, the Company sold a total of 12,802 shares for proceeds of approximately $0.3 million through the 2018 Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold a total of 32,170 shares for proceeds of approximately $0.3 million. There was no amount remaining available under this financing facility as of December 31, 2020.
 
On September 30, 2020, the Company entered into a new purchase agreement (the “2020 Purchase Agreement”) and registration rights agreement pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $25.0 million of the Company’s common stock. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2020 Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $25.0 million of the Company’s common 
 74


stock. Such sales of common stock by the Company, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at the Company’s sole discretion, over the 36-month period commencing on November 6, 2020, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 
The 2020 Purchase Agreement provides that the number of shares the Company may sell to Lincoln Park on any single business day in a regular purchase is 50,000, but that amount may be increased up to 100,000 shares, depending upon the market price of the Company’s common stock at the time of sale and subject to a maximum limit of $500,000 per regular purchase. The purchase price per share for each such regular purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of the Company’s common stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the 2020 Purchase Agreement. In addition to regular purchases, the Company may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase other amounts as accelerated purchases or as additional accelerated purchases if the closing sale price of the common stock exceeds certain threshold prices as set forth in the 2020 Purchase Agreement. There are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. There is no upper limit on the price per share that Lincoln Park must pay for common stock under a regular purchase or an accelerated purchase and in no event will shares be sold to Lincoln Park on a day when the Company’s common stock closing sale price is less than $0.25 per share.
 
On June 16, 2020, the Company received stockholder approval to permit issuances of the Company’s common stock (including the issuance of more than 19.99% of the Company’s common stock) to Lincoln Park pursuant to the 2020 Purchase Agreement.  Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $1.05 per share on March 16, 2020, the maximum number of shares the Company could issue and sell under the 2020 Purchase Agreement is approximately 23.8 million shares.  Accordingly, the Company requested and received stockholder approval for the issuance of up to 23.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement. The Company would seek additional stockholder approval before issuing more than 23.8 million shares.
 
Lincoln Park has no right to require the Company to sell any shares of common stock to Lincoln Park, but Lincoln Park is obligated to make purchases as the Company directs, subject to certain conditions.
 
Actual sales of shares of common stock to Lincoln Park under the 2020 Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the common stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 353,113 shares, excluding 180,701 shares issued as commitment fee, of common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for total net proceeds of approximately $0.7 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company issued 985,186 shares of its common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for total proceeds of $2.9 million. 
 
The net proceeds under the 2020 Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells shares of its stock to Lincoln Park. On October 2, 2020, the Company issued 180,701 shares of common stock, with the fair value of $0.5 million, to Lincoln Park as a commitment fee in connection with entering into the 2020 Purchase Agreement, which was recorded as cost of capital in stockholders’ equity. 
 
At-the-market Issuances 
 
On October 23, 2020, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Canaccord Genuity LLC (“Canaccord”), pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $10,000,000 (the “ATM Shares”), depending on market demand, with Canaccord acting as an agent for sales. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the ATM Shares. The Company may instruct Canaccord not to sell the ATM Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price the Company designates from time to time and the Company may at any time suspend sales pursuant to the Distribution Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued 1,616,331 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $3.2 million. During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company issued 536,070 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.5 million.

13. | Stock-based Compensation
----+-------------------------

 On February 6, 2020, the Company amended the Company’s 2015 New Employee Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) to increase the total number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan by 250,000 shares. Awards may only be granted under the 2015 Plan to employees who were not previously an employee or director of the Company, or following a bona fide period of non-employment, as a material inducement to entering into employment with the Company. As of December 31, 2020 there were 210,389 shares of common stock remaining and available for future issuances under the 2015 Plan.
 On June 16, 2020, the stockholders of the Company approved the Company’s 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”), which replaced the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2020 Plan provides for the award or sale of shares of common stock (including restricted stock), the award of stock units and stock appreciation rights, and the grant of both incentive stock options to purchase common stock. The 2020 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 550,000 shares of common stock, and the number of shares available for issuance will be increased to the extent that awards granted under the 2020 Plan and the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan are forfeited or expire (except as otherwise provided in the 2020 Plan). As of December 31, 2020, there were 159,939 shares of common stock remaining and available for future issuances under the 2020 Plan.
 Stock Options
 Generally, options issued under the 2020 Plan are subject to a two-year or four-year vesting schedule with 25% of the options vest on one year anniversary of the grant date, and have a contractual term of 10 years.  
           A summary of activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:
 
 
 | Options | | | Weighted Average Exercise Price | 
--------------------------------+---------+---------+---+---------------------------------+--
Balance as of December 31, 2019 | | 1,865 | | | $ | 2,968.22
Granted | | 530,000 | | | $ | 2.12 
Cancelled/forfeited | | (529 | ) | | $ | 2,486.82
Balance as of December 31, 2020 | | 531,336 | | | $ | 10.01 


 | Options | | Weighted Average Exercise Price | | | Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) | Aggregate Intrinsic Value
-------------------------------------------------+---------+---------+---------------------------------+---+-------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------------------------
Balance as of December 31, 2020 | | 531,336 | | $ | 10.01 | | 9.41 | $ | -
Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2020 | | 490,008 | | $ | 10.52 | | 9.41 | $ | -
Exercisable at December 31, 2020 | | 75,028 | | $ | 56.84 | | 9.43 | $ | -

 
The Company settles exercises of stock options with newly issued shares of its common stock.  There were no stock options exercised in 2020 or 2019. 
 The fair value of each option awarded during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
  
 | December 31, 2020 | | | December 31, 2019 | 
------------------------+-------------------+-------+---+-------------------+--
Expected term | 5.8 years | | | 7.0 years | 
Risk-free interest rate | | 0.58 | % | | | 2.41 | %
Expected volatility | | 128.6 | % | | | 96.5 | %
Dividends | | 0 | % | | | 0 | %
Resulting fair value | $ | 1.87 | | | $ | 0.26 | 

 
The weighted average risk-free interest rate represents the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the Federal Reserve Board. If the term of available treasury constant maturity instruments is not equal to the expected term of an employee option, we use the weighted average of the two Federal Reserve securities closest to the expected term of the employee option.
 The dividend yield has been assumed to be zero as the Company (a) has never declared or paid any dividends and (b) does not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.

The following table summarizes share-based compensation recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss: 
 
 
 | Years ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------+--------------------------+----
 | 2020 | | 2019 | 
Research and development | $ | 32 | | $ | 40 
General and administrative | | 215 | | | 87 
Total share-based compensation | $ | 247 | | $ | 127

 
As of December 31, 2020, the total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and stock awards not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately $704,000, which is expected to be recognized as a result of vesting under service conditions over a weighted average period of 2.81 years.
 
14. COVID-19 Pandemic and CARES Act 
 
A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.   COVID-19 has presented substantial public health and economic challenges and is affecting economies, financial markets and business operations around the world. International and U.S. governmental authorities in impacted regions have taken action in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, including issuing varying forms of “stay-at-home” orders, and restricting business functions outside of one’s home. In response, the Company put restrictions on employee travel and working from its executive offices with many employees continuing their work remotely.  While the Company has implemented additional health and safety precautions and protocols in response to the pandemic and government guidelines, the Company has not experienced a significant impact on its business and operations.  However, the Company may experience disruptions that could adversely impact its business operations as well as its preclinical studies and clinical trials. The Company is currently continuing the clinical trials it has underway in sites across the U.S., and, although there has been no significant impact to date, the Company expects that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of its clinical trials.  Some of the Company’s clinical trial sites, including those located in areas severely impacted by the pandemic, have placed new patient enrollment into clinical trials on hold or, for patients traveling from out-of-state, have implemented a 14-day self-quarantine before appointments.  In addition, some clinical trial sites have imposed limited accessibility to conduct clinical monitoring and training on-site. Although there are vaccines available, the ability to obtain a vaccine or know when herd immunity will be met, is difficult to anticipate. The Company considered the impacts of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used to prepare its consolidated financial statements and determined that there were no material adverse impacts on the Company’s results of operations and financial position at December 31, 2020. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact its business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain or treat it, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.
 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020.  The CARES Act, among other things, includes tax provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer’s social security payments, net operating loss utilization and carryback periods, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property (QIP).  The CARES Act had no material impact on the Company’s income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
15. Subsequent Events
 
Piramal Master Services Agreement 
 
On January 8, 2021, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with Piramal Pharma Solutions, Inc. (“Piramal”), for Piramal to perform certain services related to the development, manufacture, and supply of our RNL-Liposome Intermediate Drug Product. The MSA includes the transfer of analytical methods, development of microbiological methods, process transfer and optimization, intermediate drug product manufacturing, and stability studies for the Company.  The transfer 
 77


will be performed at Piramal’s facility located in Lexington, Kentucky.  The parties contemplate that the MSA will lead to clinical and commercial supply agreements between the Company and Piramal.
 The MSA has a term of five years and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party notifies the other no later than six months prior to the original term or any additional terms of its intention to not renew the MSA.  The Company has the right to terminate the MSA for convenience upon thirty days’ prior written notice.  Either party may terminate the MSA upon an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. 
 Issuance of common stocks
During 2021 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the Company issued 985,186 shares of its common stock under the 2020 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of $2.9 million, and issued 536,070 shares under the Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of $1.5 million.
