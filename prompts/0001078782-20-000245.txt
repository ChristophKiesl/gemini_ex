General Overview
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on April 21, 2009 under the name Mokita Exploration, Ltd. to develop our business as a mineral exploration company, however, due to the scarcity of potentially profitable mining properties, we restructured our business strategy to provide Canadian credit card payment services. To reflect this new business focus, on February 5, 2010, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to Mokita, Inc. 
 
In April 2011, we intended to enter the oil and gas industry. On July 20, 2011, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation changing our name to Mokita Ventures, Inc., to reflect our new business plan, which name was rejected by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and on May 30, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to restore our name to Mokita, Inc.
 
On February 27, 2014, we had a change of control as a result of Irma Colon-Alonso resigning as our officer/director and Ronald Lusk being appointed our President/CEO/Director; the following day, February 28, 2014, our board of directors and a majority of our voting securities approved a change of name to MediJane Holdings Inc. A Certificate of Amendment to affect that name change became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on March 4, 2014 and was approved by FINRA, effective as of March 10, 2014. The name change was effective with OTC Markets at the opening of trading on March 10, 2014 under the new ticker symbol "MJMD".

On March 8, 2017, we filed an Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name from MediJane Holdings, Inc. to Stem Bioscience, Inc. 
 
In May 2018, we changed our name to Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment filed with the Nevada Secretary of State effective May 31, 2018. The name change was accepted by FINRA and became effective with the OTC Markets on November 2, 2018 with our new trading symbol, “PLSI”.
 
In September 2018, we completed a merger and consolidation with Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited (Canada). As part of the consolidation, the Series B Preferred Shares owned by Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals were cancelled. Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited (Canada) had entered into asset purchase agreements with Phoenix Life Sciences Inc, Phoenix Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Phoenix Pharms Capital Corporation and Phoenix Pharms Inc to consolidate all assets, liabilities, trade secrets, knowhow, diagrams and business plans, as well as all government relationships and pending contracts. Other than as specifically negotiated with former employees, contractors and officers, all shareholders were provided with a share exchange to receive one share of our common stock for one share previously owned in one of these predecessor named companies.
 Pursuant to the September 18, 2018 Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited, a Nevada Corporation, and Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited, a Canadian Corporation (“PLSI CA”), we completed the merger with PLSI CA, with Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited as the surviving public entity.
 
On September 18, 2018, we announced the final consolidation activities of Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited with Stem Biosciences, Inc., Blue Dragon Ventures, and the MediJane Brand, and further announced that our common stock would trade publicly under the symbol MJMD, which symbol was changed on November 2, 2018 to PLSI.
 
Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited (Canada) and Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited (Nevada) commenced their consolidated business in 2018, after which our affiliates provided working capital to meet the consolidation costs. We then entered into subscription agreements with certain affiliates and non-affiliate investors to provide approximately financing of $2,100,000 in return for issuance of 800,000 shares. A non-affiliate investor who had previously entered into a subscription agreement to purchase $20,000,000 of our common stock shares at $10 per share with Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited (Canada) entered into an agreement to exchange the subscription for warrants to purchase our common stock at a price of $10, with the purchase to be completed by December 31, 2019.
 
Further, as part of the merger and consolidation, Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited (Canada) and Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited (Nevada) entered into settlement agreements with former investors, employees and contractors whereby their debt, shares held in entities subject of the consolidation, or outstanding amounts were settled in exchange for a full release of claims, we issued 8,000,000 common stock shares to the various parties, and assumed $2,000,000 of settlements payable. Through the consolidation, we established the necessary relationships and contracts for our execution strategy, and settle any potential claim or liability in connection with any claims by former investors, employees and contractors.
 
On September 22, 2018, our Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Russell Stone as our Director.

On February 2019, our Board of Directors appointed Michael Gobel as our Director. 
 
Our Business
 
Restructured in 2018 through merger and consolidation, we are a holding company that operates through our operating subsidiaries with the ultimate goals of owning and operating a network of pharmaceutical manufacturing laboratories, farming operations, community clinics and dispensing pharmacies focused on providing vertically integrated healthcare solutions in partnership with national healthcare systems.
 
Our focus is to create healthcare solutions through the use of cannabinoids to manage a broad range of health conditions, both generically and through our proprietary formulations. We intend to establish farming operations and pharmaceutical manufacturing laboratories using specific strains of the cannabis sativa plant and other cannabinoids as a base element in the range of products produced and sold. Our goal is to research, produce, and distribute products around the globe that target and treat; diabetes, cancer, pain, autoimmune, psychological, neurological, and sleep disorders. 

5



Phoenix Metabolic is the initial product we intend to manufacture and distribute. Extracted from specific strains of cannabis sativa, Phoenix Metabolic has been developed to provide a safe, non-toxic and efficacious way to manage blood sugar levels and diabetic complications. This is based on mounting levels of data supporting the use of cannabinoids in the management of diabetes and clinical experience of our U.S. Diabetes Director. The final formulation is estimated to be completed by the end of 2019 in conjunction with our research partner.
 
We plan to build an integrated healthcare organization by creating products and programs using emerging biological products, such as cannabinoid plant extracts. We intend to deliver these programs through managed agriculture, pharmaceutical production, physician education and national networks of community clinic and dispensing pharmacies, combined with wholesale and distribution networks. Leading formulators have developed a range of pharmaceutical-grade products from the cannabis plant. We will utilize our intellectual property in extraction technology, delivery systems, and distribution to produce high-quality products in terms of control, consistency, accountability, and packaging. 
 
We anticipate that our delivery systems will eventually include oral soft gel capsules, thin film dissolvable strips, transdermal patches, sublingual oral sprays, suppositories and topical creams. 
 
We initially intend to produce our products, in the Republic of Vanuatu, using cannabinoids derived from various strains of cannabis sativa. Several of these strains may be classified as Industrial Hemp. Industrial Hemp has been defined as an exclusion/exception to the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), as, “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” Although it is clear that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, not all parts of the Cannabis sativa L. plant are considered as such under the federal definition. Moreover, as set forth in the Agriculture Act of 2016 (commonly known as the Farm Bill), the entire industrial hemp plant is lawful and is not subject to the CSA
 
Phoenix Life’s Vanuatu operation is licensed as a pharmaceutical manufacturer in Vanuatu. Should amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act be passed in Vanuatu, our Vanuatu operations plans to seek licensing for cultivation and export of cannabis derived products. While, the United States maintains cannabis sativa, and specifically THC as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance, the Republic of Vanuatu has joined over thirty (30) countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom in legalizing cannabis for medical use.
 
We plan to provide capital to a series of fully or partially owned or partnership laboratories and ventures with medical professionals, researchers, cannabinoid related projects and pharmacists, by providing access to intellectual property and distribution networks, plus a range of services that will include the following: preparing the legal framework for new products, purchasing real estate for cultivation and manufacture, building of production facilities, community clinics and dispensing pharmacies and retail outlets as well as operating of health and wellness centers.
 
Pending adequate financing, licensing, legal passage of medical cannabis legislation, we will establish cultivation and export of cannabis derived products from Vanuatu, to earn revenue through the sales of products by supplying products and services to national healthcare systems, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, ecommerce and our community clinic and dispensing pharmacy network.
 
Contingent upon adequate financing and required licenses from the Vanuatuan Government, for cultivation, manufacture and dispensing of cannabis derived products, we plan to complete the development and roll out of 5 acres of cultivation and post 5 acre trial, pharmaceutical manufacturing laboratories, community clinics and dispensing pharmacies, clinical data gathers and completion of patent preparation. Potentially, this is estimated to provide service for up to five hundred thousand (500,000) diabetes patients annually, with a target revenue of $300 per patient per year. This initial production will focus on the production and resale throughout the Western Pacific Region of soft gel capsules containing cannabinoids derived from a specific strain of cannabis sativa that forms the basis for our diabetes management formulation, Phoenix Metabolic, as well as related planned future cannabinoid products, including study products for clinical trials. Once fully operational, our laboratory will be used for the extraction of cannabinoids, infusion, and packaging, and it will also provide logistics and delivery on an international level through local airports. We anticipate that once operating at fully capacity, our initial Vanuatu laboratory will be designed to be able to produce 2,000,000 soft gel capsules per day, based on equipment operating for six hours per day in a five-day work week. 
 
Subject to the success of our initial production facility, the successful roll out of distribution, and adequate financing, we intend to expand at a rate of 200 acres per year to accommodate a small portion of the 680 million diabetes worldwide, in addition to patients served through the addition of other products in our Life portfolio. We also intend to establish joint ventures with universities and other institutions to engage in research designed to develop pharmaceuticals derived from cannabis extracts. We will seek partners to establish a research study on the use of cannabinoids, and specifically Phoenix Metabolic to combat diabetes blood sugar management and the complications related to diabetes and other metabolic disorders.

6



We intend to use the clinical data collected in Vanuatu in conjunction with leading Australian and United States researchers to analyze and publish the results of these trials and subsequently apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for a New Drug Application (NDA) under for Phoenix Metabolic to be approved for phased trials and fast tracked through the 505(b) submission process. 
 Nearly ninety years after its discovery, access to insulin is beyond the reach of millions of people with diabetes around the world. Access to insulin or a new diabetes solution is an essential and non-negotiable need, in short, a matter of life or death. In many low- and middle-income countries, the availability of insulin in the public sector is often poor. Therefore, people with diabetes are either forced to purchase insulin in the private sector at its full price, use less than the prescribed amount so that their supply lasts longer, or go without. Serious complications result from suboptimal treatment, such as blindness and amputations, and pre-mature death.
 
We intend to provide diabetes management through Phoenix Metabolic at prices that are affordable for individuals, to national healthcare systems and to foreign governments to provide cost effective solutions to the global diabetes epidemic. 
 
Our entire plan is contingent upon adequate financing and operational efficiencies to enable us to accomplish the foregoing goals. 
 
Our Initial Vanuatu Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Laboratory and Farming Operations

In May 2019, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Vanuatuan Ministry of Agriculture on behalf of Republic of Vanuatu for the purposes of establishing a Public Private Partnership (PPP). The PPP intends to lease 500 acres, as a pilot facility; and has the provision to obtain a lease for 5,000 acres. The initial property will include farming operations, up to 250 acres, while providing a site for the location of a 50,000 square foot industrial space for the creation of a manufacturing laboratory and production facility on the island of Santo, in Vanuatu. We intend for this facility to include a fully-equipped laboratory for the development, production, packaging, distribution and sale of various cannabinoid-infused products, most specifically Phoenix Metabolic and several generic medical cannabis products for doctors’ prescription. We intend for the facility to provide the capability to service up to 1,000,000 patients per year. See “Properties” below.
 
The manufacturing laboratory and production facility will be designed to include office space, a demonstration area, laboratories, and production area, along with distribution and storage. Conference rooms are also planned in the future for onsite training. The laboratory area will include clean rooms for extraction and infusion of cannabinoids into the medical and pharmaceutical products. The laboratories will be designed for expansion as market conditions and demand continues to grow and will be GMP certified.
 
Upon commencing operations, raw plant materials will be sourced from the farming operations. After arrival at the laboratory, the plants will be processed, and the active ingredients extracted into a raw and / or highly refined oil format. This cannabinoid rich extract is what will be used as the primary compound in the medical and pharmaceutical products, including Phoenix Metabolic. Clinical-grade extraction technology includes proprietary processes and state-of-the-art equipment, such as centrifuges, filters, and evaporators. 
 
Specialized pharmaceutical production equipment shall be used for blending, infusion, and filling of these healthcare products. Professional chemists, botanists, and biologist will manage infusion of the active ingredient into our specialized and targeted delivery systems, which include; oral soft gel capsules in the first instance and then, thin film dissolvable strips, and sublingual oral sprays.
 
All products will be stored in the secure distribution area in preparation for delivery to the national healthcare systems, community clinics and dispensing pharmacies, as well as other healthcare providers and other medical retail locations. When completed, the laboratory and production facility will have the capacity for global delivery fulfillment through international export, as well as servicing the Vanuatu market. All products will be tracked and securely manifested for delivery to retail and medical offices for distribution. 
 
Based on the long term projected amount of raw materials to be produced by the farming operations and the capability of the extraction equipment, the facility is anticipated to process 75,000 lbs. (34,000 kg) of raw material per month, which equates to 7,500 lbs. (3,400 kg) of extract per month, or enough active ingredients to service one million (1,000,000) diabetes patients annually. 
 
The foregoing is contingent upon adequate financing and operational efficiencies to enable us to accomplish the foregoing goals. 
 
Farming Operations
 
The licensed cannabis cultivation of the farming operation is designed to provide scalable growth capacity to service the global needs for an effective and affordable diabetes management solution. In addition, with the growing demand for generic medical cannabis products for doctors’ prescription, we intend to leverage the benefits of equatorial growing conditions and developing country labor solutions to maximize production, while keeping costs contained.
 
Cultivating cannabis in an equatorial zone provides a raft of benefits in the areas of soil, light and water management. Growing organically in the Vanuatu provides a significant cost savings with regards to initial capital expenses, as there is no need to create fully enclosed greenhouses, when the climate provides greenhouse like conditions to maximize year-round cultivation.

Creating employment solutions in Vanuatu, provides access to labor at significantly reduced rates, while creating economic development opportunities in the country as it grows. These labor rates, when combined with the reduced capital and energy costs, creates the potential ability to be a global low-cost producer.
 
The foregoing is contingent upon adequate financing and operational efficiencies to enable us to accomplish the foregoing goals
 
Community Clinics and Dispensing Pharmacies
 
We have partnered with Global Health Initiative, a non-profit organization of which our Chief Executive Officer is a Director, for the roll out of education, research and a national networks of community clinics and dispensing pharmacies, in Vanuatu. These clinics have been designed to provide large scale screening of communities prior to operation, whereby securing the prerequisite number of patients, while providing diabetes management solutions, including monitoring and dispensing of products initially such as Phoenix Metabolic.
 
The dispensing pharmacy will provide us with a distribution point for refillable bottles, whereas the clinic provides both initial screening and ongoing reporting of diabetes management. As we continue to roll out additional products from our portfolio, services will be increased to accommodate the increased distribution.
 
The clinics will provide initial triage but will refer patients to regional hospitals where their condition requires a greater level of care.
 
Pricing Metrics
 
GW Pharmaceuticals, a United Kingdom company, is a large competitor as to cannabinoid therapy. GW Pharmaceuticals is currently approved to sell Epidiolex in the United States and is conducting clinical trials and is selling licenses in various countries for distribution of their products.
 
GW Pharmaceuticals primary product, Epidiolex, has been priced at $32,500 per year. Each bottle of the liquid suspension contains approximately 10,000mg of cannabidiol. This equates to a monthly cost of $2,700 or a cost of $270 per 1,000mg or 1 gram of active ingredient. 
 
Insulin has been the primary product used for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, through supplementing the levels of insulin produced by the body. Although pricing varies between countries and the development status of countries, an average in a developed country, Insulin currently an average of costs $400-750 per month, while in least developed and developing countries it costs approximately $150 per month.
 
Metformin is another product used for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, through down regulating the function of the liver in converting sugars to glycogen, whereby inhibiting the natural function of the liver. Although pricing varies between countries and the development status of countries, an average in a developed country, Metformin currently costs approximately $200 per month, while in least developed and developing countries it costs approximately $70 per month.
 
In establishing the economic model for maximizing access and patient care, we have created a three (3) tier pricing program for our future operations and product line. In developed countries Phoenix Metabolic will be priced at $150 per month. In developing countries, this will be reduced to $50 per patient per month and in least developed nations it will be further reduced to $25 per patient per month. This cost includes initial testing, ongoing testing, supply of Phoenix Metabolic product, Community Clinics and Dispensing Pharmacy operations.
 
As further market development occurs and a greater portion of products achieve greater market penetration, pricing will be able to be increased or maintained.
 
Products 
 
We intend to conduct FDA compliant clinical studies on these products in the future, and once approved, introduce these products into the United States market. However, until such time, we will work with countries like Vanuatu to develop access programs for products such as Phoenix Metabolic, as well as generic product for doctors’ prescription.
 
We intend to use products that we have already developed to potentially, acquire, license, and further develop a broad portfolio of products that use cannabinoid-based therapeutics to treat conditions that may include diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, anxiety, a variety of cancers (including melanoma), chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Crohn's disease and colitis, epilepsy and seizures, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS), multiple sclerosis, pain management, Parkinson's disease, Plaque Psoriasis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Rheumatoid Arthritis, stress and sports management

Our ongoing rollout strategy includes the long-term future building of an international portfolio of production laboratories and Life Science Campuses. We intend to build these laboratories and campuses to create a network of pharmaceutical production, farming operations, research, and education facilities. Initially located in Vanuatu, we intend to launch campuses internationally in Australia and the United States, and potentially into, the United Kingdom and other potential target locations. Our laboratories and campuses will be designed specifically to produce bioorganic compounds and other advanced medical products. The campuses will provide for vertically integrated manufacturing, including all stages of production. 
 
All of the foregoing is contingent upon adequate financing and operational efficiencies to enable us to accomplish the foregoing goals

Marketing and Distribution 
 
We intend to focus our initial marketing and distribution in the areas of healthcare related to diabetes management, as well as other diseases known to be managed or treated through the use of medical cannabis and its cannabinoid compounds.
According to the World Health Organization, “The prevalence of diabetes has been steadily increasing for the past three decades and is growing most rapidly in low- and middle-income countries. The percentage of deaths attributable to high blood glucose or diabetes is almost 52% in low-income countries, compared with 23% in high-income countries. Insulin and other basic diabetes medicines are reported to be scarce in low-income countries. Only 23% of low-income countries report that insulin is generally available.” (World Health Organization, 10 facts on diabetes, 2016)
 
We intend to distribute our products to physicians, hospitals, and other health care centers to ensure accurate dosing and optimized delivery based upon the individual needs of patients. This gives doctors and other healthcare providers the ability to recommend or prescribe specific treatment options using cannabinoids as a replacement for conventional pharmaceuticals. 
 
Product distribution will be a combination of:
 

National distribution channels, 
 
Community Clinic and dispensing Pharmacies, 
 
Hospital Sales, 
 
Online Sales 
 

We have secured a relationship with the Vanuatu Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to focus on export initiatives throughout the world. Providing the Republic of Vanuatu with an export stream benefits to the Vanuatu nation, both directly through export duty and job creation and indirectly. 
 
To accomplish our distribution, we will establish agreements with several national pharmaceutical and medical appliance selling organizations to ensure that the products can be presented to national healthcare systems, pharmacies and pharmacy wholesalers’ doctors throughout the world. This selling organization is able to create significant distribution for products that doctors, and other medical professionals can prescribe or sell through pharmacies
 
Following completion of our Vanuatu laboratory and production facility, we will commence monthly product trials with new countries, mirroring operations in Vanuatu. This will include education and product information to equip the representatives with the ability to provide localized trials for the relevant health administration agency to demonstrate local efficacy, then the rollout of community clinics and dispensing pharmacies to provide fixed cost, diabetes management solutions. 
 
All of the foregoing is contingent upon adequate financing and operational efficiencies to enable us to accomplish the foregoing goals
 
Industry Analysis
 
The health, wellness and cannabinoid industries in the United States have been growing due to a substantial growth in the numbers of states approving the use of medical and adult-use marijuana and cannabinoid products. Additionally, in recent years, several internationally recognized medical journals and medical professionals have published results relating to the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of cancer, childhood seizures, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis and pain management. This swell of interest in alternative health and wellness related to the use of cannabinoids is resulting in the establishment of new opportunities across many industries. Individual states have passed legislation for the regulation of medical and recreational use, but the lack of federal mandates has created some uncertainty in the industry.
Competitive Analysis
 
The medical cannabis industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. Our competitors have substantially greater capital and operational resources, facilities, and infrastructure than we have, enabling them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include G.W. Pharmaceuticals, Insys Therapeutics, MedBox, Inc., TerraTech Corp., Cannabis Science, Inc., Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cannabis-Rx, Inc., and Nemus Biosciences, Inc. In addition, the development of therapies and pharmaceutical products based on extracts from the cannabis plant is being undertaken by a number of medical and educational institutions, including the University of Mississippi, which is the only U.S. based entity authorized by the federal government to cultivate cannabis for research. Such institutions have significantly greater financial resources and facilities than we have.
Revenue 
 
We intend to generate revenue through the manufacture, sales and distribution of its products in countries where cannabis has been legalized for medical purposes and where foreign governments approve specific of our products for sale in their specific markets or through public private partnerships.
Leases
 
ASC 842, Leases, was required to be adopted for all financial years beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires long term leases (longer than 12 month) to be capitalized with a corresponding liability for the term of the lease and expensed over that term. However currently we have no long-term leases.
Government Regulations
 
Most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to a company obtaining marketing approval our products in those countries. These countries may be unwilling or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit the products to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time.

The cannabis industry faces challenges as a result of federal laws which limit and regulate cannabis products and federal tax laws which make it difficult for us to claim deductions on our tax returns. The IRS has been enforcing IRC Sec. 280E, a law from the 1970s that bars tax deductions for business expenses incurred by drug dealers. This law prevents and deduction or credit for any amount paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business if said trade or business consists of trafficking in Schedule I or II controlled substances which is prohibited by federal law or the law of any State in which the trade or business is being conducted. This law was intended to stop drug dealers from claiming tax deductions, but the IRS has stated that it applies to medical marijuana companies as well. The tax court has upheld this interpretation. As a result of this, we may not be able to claim business deductions on our tax returns.
 
Our products contain controlled substances as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, not currently "accepted medical use" in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription.
 
While cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts if to be approved federally, must be placed in Schedules II—V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the "accepted medical use" requirement. If any proposed products developed receive FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place it in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. Consequently, its manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use will be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in the loss of our DEA registration, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. In addition, the scheduling process may take one or more years, thereby delaying the launch of any product in the United States. Furthermore, if the FDA, DEA, or any foreign regulatory authority determines that any product may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more clinical or other data than we currently anticipate establishing whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of any proposed product. Our products are federally considered a Schedule 1 controlled substance. As a result, we only sell our products within states that have passed marijuana laws allowing for the sale of Schedule 1 products.
 
Facilities conducting research, manufacturing, distributing, importing or exporting, or dispensing controlled substances must be registered (licensed) to perform these activities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All these facilities must renew their registrations annually, except dispensing facilities, which must renew every three years. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the importation, manufacturing or distribution of any products. Furthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.
 
Individual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule any product candidates as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our partners must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.
 
Because some of the proposed products contain cannabis extracts, which are Schedule I substances, to conduct clinical trials in the United States prior to approval, each of the research sites must submit a research protocol to the DEA and obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow those sites to handle and dispense the products and to obtain the product from our importer. If the DEA delays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the clinical trial could be significantly delayed, and the clinical trial sites could be lost. The importer for the clinical trials must also obtain a Schedule I importer registration and an import permit for each import.

If a product is approved and classified as a Schedule II or III substance, an importer can import for commercial purposes if it obtains an importer registration and files an application for an import permit for each import. The DEA provides annual assessments/estimates to the International Narcotics Control Board that guides the DEA in the amounts of controlled substances that the DEA authorizes to be imported. The failure to identify an importer or obtain the necessary import authority, including specific quantities, could affect the availability of proposed products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, an application for a Schedule II importer registration must be published in the Federal Register, and there is a waiting period for third party comments to be submitted.
 
If a product is approved and classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, federal law may prohibit the import of the substance for commercial purposes. If a product is listed as a Schedule II substance, the manufacturer will not be allowed to import the drug for commercial purposes unless the DEA determines that domestic supplies are inadequate or there is inadequate domestic competition among domestic manufacturers for the substance as defined by the DEA. Moreover, Schedule I controlled substances have never been registered with the DEA for importation commercial purposes, only for scientific and research needs. Therefore, if neither a product could be imported, a product would have to be wholly manufactured in the United States, and we would need to secure a manufacturer that would be required to obtain and maintain a separate DEA registration for that activity If, because of a Schedule II classification or voluntarily, a project developer were to conduct manufacturing or repackaging/relabeling in the United States, they would be subject to the DEA's annual manufacturing and procurement quota requirements. Additionally, regardless of the scheduling of any product, cannabis comprising the active ingredient in the final dosage form are currently Schedule I controlled substances and would be subject to such quotas as these substances could remain listed on Schedule I. The annual quota allocated to us or our contract manufacturers for the active ingredient in any product may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Consequently, any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers', procurement and/or production quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operations.
 
If a product is scheduled as Schedule II or III, we would also need to identify wholesale distributors with the appropriate DEA registrations and authority to distribute the product to pharmacies and other health care providers. We would need to identify distributors to distribute the product to pharmacies; these distributors would need to obtain Schedule II or III distribution registrations. The failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, or the loss any of those registrations could result in increased costs to us. If a product is a Schedule II drug, pharmacies would have to maintain enhanced security with alarms and monitoring systems and they must adhere to recordkeeping and inventory requirements. This, coupled with the fact that a product must be refrigerated, may discourage some pharmacies from carrying the product. Furthermore, state and federal enforcement actions, regulatory requirements, and legislation intended to reduce prescription drug abuse, such as the requirement that physicians consult a state prescription drug monitoring program may make physicians less willing to prescribe, and pharmacies to dispense, Schedule II products.
