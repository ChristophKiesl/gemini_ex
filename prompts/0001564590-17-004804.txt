 Item 1. Business 
 Destination XL Group, Inc., together with our subsidiaries (the “Company”), is the largest specialty retailer of big & tall men’s apparel with retail and direct operations in the United States and London, England. We operate under the trade names of Destination XL®, DXL®, DXL outlets, Casual Male XL®, Casual Male XL outlets, Rochester Clothing, ShoesXL® and LivingXL®. We operate 192 DXL retail stores, 13 DXL outlet stores, 97 Casual Male XL retail stores, 36 Casual Male XL outlet stores and 5 Rochester Clothing stores. Our direct business includes our DestinationXL.com and bigandtall.com e-commerce sites which support our stores, brands and product extensions. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Destination XL Group, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 28, 2017, January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 as “fiscal 2016”, “fiscal 2015” and “fiscal 2014,” respectively. 
OUR INDUSTRY 
 We believe that the men’s big & tall apparel market, which includes pants with a waist size of 42” and greater, as well as tops sized 1XL and greater, generates approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion in sales annually and represents approximately 11% of the overall men’s apparel business. Growth in this segment has historically been driven by rapidly changing market demographics. We estimate that our market share in fiscal 2016 was approximately 12%.  We believe that we can increase our market share by catering to the broader target market, attracting customers from various income, age and lifestyle segments and offering the widest selection of sizes and styles that fit well. An opportunity also exists for market share growth from the lower-size range of our market, that is, men in the 38”-46” waist size. These sizes are usually at the high end of the size range for most retailers and, as a result, the selection is usually limited at such retailers. 
HISTORY 
 Our Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 under the name Designs, Inc. Until fiscal 1995, we operated exclusively in Levi Strauss & Co. branded apparel mall and outlet stores. In May 2002, we acquired the Casual Male business from Casual Male Corp. at a bankruptcy court-ordered auction. At the time of the acquisition, Casual Male was the largest specialty retailer of men’s clothing in the big & tall market in the United States. As a result of the acquisition, on August 8, 2002, we changed our name to “Casual Male Retail Group, Inc.” 
 Through fiscal 2010, we primarily operated Casual Male XL retail stores, Casual Male XL outlet stores and Rochester Clothing stores, along with the associated websites and catalogs. We catered to all customers through these three store formats, from our value-oriented customer (Casual Male XL outlets) to our luxury-oriented customer (Rochester Clothing stores). During that year, we tested a new store concept, Destination XL (“DXL”). The DXL store concept merged all of our existing brands under one roof, offering our customers a superior shopping environment with an extensive assortment of product and an increased presence of name brands, without having to shop multiple stores. In addition to offering our customers a wide assortment, we also wanted to provide them with an outstanding and unique shopping experience. We are focused on providing outstanding customer service through our DXL stores, with everything from larger fitting rooms to professional, trained associates providing both personal attention and on-site tailoring. With the initial success of this store format, we then made a similar change to our e-commerce business in fiscal 2011 when we 
 
3


launched our DestinationXL.com website which, like our DXL store, merged all of our previous websites into one consolidated e-commerce site providing our customers the ability to cross-shop our brands easily. 
 As part of our new direction, in December 2012, we changed our NASDAQ stock ticker symbol to “DXLG” followed by a change in February 2013 of our corporate name to “Destination XL Group, Inc.” 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 In fiscal 2012, we began the transition from our Casual Male XL retail and Rochester Clothing stores to our DXL store format. Initially, we envisioned that this transition would take three years.  Based on the performance of the initial DXL stores, we accelerated the pace in fiscal 2013, closing over 100 Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores and opening 51 DXL stores.  This accelerated pace created unexpected hurdles for us in converting our existing customer base to the new DXL stores, which negatively impacted our sales.  As a result, in fiscal 2014, we opted to revise our strategy to slow the pace of our transition to take advantage of our existing Casual Male XL stores to help transition our customer base. We also introduced a smaller DXL store format, which has allowed us to penetrate smaller markets that we originally thought were too small for a DXL store, and a DXL outlet store format.  In fiscal 2015, we completed a market opportunity study of our existing store portfolio, including the smaller DXL store format and outlet store format, and believe that there is opportunity for additional growth beyond what was initially identified when we began the rollout in fiscal 2012.
 During fiscal 2016, we opened our 200th store and, at fiscal year end, we had 192 DXL stores and 13 DXL outlet stores, with a DXL presence in every major metropolitan market in the continental United States. 
 With the bulk of the Casual Male XL to DXL store transition behind us, in addition to our efforts to maintain the strong in-store experience which our customers enjoy, we are now focusing our efforts on improving traffic to our stores and growing our e-commerce business with emphasis on increasing brand awareness and our customer base. Based on a market study we commissioned in 2016, 6 out of 10 potential customers do not know who we are.  We also experienced a slight decrease in our brand awareness in fiscal 2016 and a decrease in store traffic in the second half of fiscal 2016, which may have resulted in part from our decision not to conduct a Fall/holiday media marketing campaign.  As a result, in fiscal 2017, we will be revitalizing our marketing program, through a combination of media and digital strategies, including efforts to improve communications with our existing customers through personalization and more targeted mailings.  We expect to increase our marketing spend in fiscal 2017 to help create and drive traffic to our stores and e-commerce sites.
 While we believe market opportunity exists to support a strategy of opening 30-40 DXL stores per year, given the current weakness in the retail environment, we are taking a more measured approach to store growth in fiscal 2017.  In some markets, where a Casual Male XL store performs well, we may look to extend its lease on a short-term basis instead of replacing it with a DXL store at expiration, allowing us time to secure the right location for a DXL store.  As such, we currently expect to open 19 DXL retail stores and 1 DXL outlet store in fiscal 2017.  We currently anticipate that beyond fiscal 2017, we will continue to open stores at a slower pace for the foreseeable future.  
 International Growth
 In addition to our Rochester Clothing store located in London, England, we also have one franchised DXL store in the Middle East at the Symphony Mall in Kuwait City, Kuwait, which was opened in fiscal 2014 pursuant to a franchise agreement with The Standard Arabian Business & Enterprises Company (SABECO).
 Based on our experience to date, we believe that the international big & tall market is currently underserved and, based on the success of our DXL concept in the U.S. and the positive customer response for our Kuwait City franchised store, we see an opportunity for growth internationally in the future.  
 In the spring of fiscal 2017, we are opening two DXL stores in Toronto, Canada. These will be the first DXL brand stores operated by the Company outside of the United States. 
 OUR BUSINESS 
 We operate as an omni-channel retailer.  Through our multiple brands, which include both branded apparel and private-label, we offer a broad range of merchandise at varying price points, catering from the value-oriented customer to the luxury-oriented customer. Our objective is to appeal to all of our customers by providing a good, better, best array of product assortments in all primary lifestyles with multiple and convenient ways to shop.

Our DXL stores cater to all income demographics and offer our customers merchandise in all lifestyles from casual to business, young to mature, in all price ranges and in all large sizes from XL and up. Our Casual Male XL stores primarily carry moderately priced branded and private label casual sportswear and dresswear, while our Rochester Clothing stores carry fine quality, designer and branded menswear. We also operate Casual Male XL outlets and DXL outlets for our value-oriented consumer.  In addition to our stores, we operate our Destination XL e-commerce site which is similar to our DXL store concept and offers a brand range of merchandise at each price point, including a complete offering of shoes.   
Another critical part of our business operation is managing the number of sizes offered to our customers and optimizing our in-stock position throughout each season. Our best-selling pant has 57 size combinations as compared to an average retailer who may only have 15 different size combinations.  We maintain a consolidated inventory across all channels which enables us to manage our in-stock position of all sizes effectively, ultimately improving customer service. Moreover, our planning and allocation methodologies, with respect to store assortment planning, help to optimize each location’s market potential without excessive inventory levels. 
 MERCHANDISE 
 A vital component of our business strategy is to offer our customers a broad assortment of apparel that is appropriate to our diverse customer base. Regardless of our customers’ age, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle preference, we are able to assemble a wardrobe to fit our customers’ apparel needs. In addition, we offer such assortments in private-label product, balanced with an array of brand name labels. With over 5,000 styles available, we carry tops in sizes up to 8XL and 6XLT, bottoms with waist sizes 38” to 66”, and shoes in sizes 10W to 18. In addition, we added to our product assortment a smaller fit XL and XLT to appeal to our target “end-of-rack” customer. 
 Our stores are merchandised to showcase entire outfits by lifestyle, including traditional, active, denim, dress wear and contemporary. This format allows us to merchandise key items and seasonal goods in prominent displays and makes coordinating outfits easier for the customer while encouraging multi-item purchases. This lifestyle layout also allows us to manage store space more effectively in each market to target local demographics. The key item strategy is also fully integrated by lifestyle, allowing us to focus on merchandise presentation and offer our customers a compelling value proposition. 
 Merchandise assortments in our DXL stores are organized not only by lifestyle, but within each lifestyle, the assortments are shown in a “good”, “better”, “best” and “luxury” visual presentation, again to benefit our customers’ ease of shopping. With the “best” merchandise assortments featured most prominently in the DXL store, our customers are able to visualize current fashion trends and easily select their wardrobes within their desired price points in a convenient manner. 
 We carry several well-known national brands of merchandise as well as a number of our own private-label lines within our “good”, “better”, “best” and “luxury” price points.  The penetration of branded apparel in our DXL stores can range from 15% to 80%, depending on several factors, but on average, our DXL stores carry approximately 47% branded merchandise.  
 Higher-End Luxury Fashion Apparel -“Best” and “Luxury” Merchandise 
 Within this higher-end price range, we carry a broad selection of quality apparel from well-known branded manufacturers such as Bogosse®, Brooks Brothers®, Gran Sasso, John Laing®, Remy, Psycho Bunny®, Derek Rose, Brioni®, Coppley, Eton®, Hickey Freeman®, Jack Victor®, Lucky, Michael Kors®, Pantherella®, Paul & Shark, JOE’S® Jeans, Robert Graham®, Robert Talbot, St. Hillaire, Ted Baker®, Tulliani, True Religion®, Turnbull & Asser® and David Donahue. 
 Moderate-Priced Apparel -“Better” Merchandise 
 We offer our customer an extensive selection of quality sportswear and dress clothing at moderate prices carrying such well-known brands such as: Junk Food®, Rainforest, Brooks Brothers®, O’Neill®, Retro Brand, Cutter & Buck®, Levis®, Adidas® Golf, Columbia, Berne®, Carhartt®, Callaway®, CK Jeans®, CK Sport®,  Jockey®, Lacoste®, Majestic, Polo Ralph Lauren®, Tommy Bahama®, Tommy Hilfiger®, Tallia® and Trafalger®. 
 In addition, we carry several private-label lines: 
  
• | Twenty Eight Degrees™ is targeted as a contemporary/modern line offering sportswear and loungewear.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Society of One is a jeanswear brand catering to the needs of the fashion denim customer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rochester is a line that targets traditional luxury styles. We also offer a complete selection of sportcoats, dress shirts and neckwear under our Rochester Black Label private label.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Value-Priced Apparel -“Good” Merchandise 
 For our value-oriented customers, we carry Geoffrey Beene®, Cubavera, Nautica® and Nautica Jeans®, Dockers, Lee, Perry Ellis, Wrangler, Reebok and PX Clothing. In addition we carry several private label lines: 
  
• | Harbor Bay® was our first proprietary brand and it is a traditional line which continues to represent a significant portion of our business, specifically in terms of our core basic merchandise.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gold Series™ is our core performance offering of tailored-related separates, blazers, dress slacks, dress shirts and neckwear that blends comfort features such as stretch, stain resistance and wrinkle-free fabrications with basic wardrobe essentials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synrgy™ targets the customer looking for a contemporary/modern look.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oak Hill® is a premier line catering to those customers looking for slightly more style and quality than our Harbor Bay line but still in a traditional lifestyle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | True Nation® is a denim-inspired line consisting of vintage-screen t-shirts and wovens and is geared towards our younger customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Island Passport® is an island-inspired line of camp shirts, printed woven shirts and relaxed island-inspired pants.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RETAIL CHANNEL 
 Destination XL stores (“DXL”) 
 Our DXL store concept brings all of our brands together in one format. Within this format, we can cater to our very diverse customer group, with merchandise representing all price points, from our luxury brands to value-oriented brands, and all lifestyles, from business to denim.  The size of our current DXL stores, which contain almost triple the product assortments of a Casual Male XL store, currently averages 8,000 square feet, but is expected to decrease closer to 7,500 square feet as we open future DXL stores.  As discussed above, in fiscal 2014, we began opening smaller (5,000-6,500 square feet) DXL stores.  Because the size of these stores is smaller, they carry a smaller product offering than our other DXL stores but are representative of the “good, better, best” merchandise variety. The locations of our DXL stores are also an essential aspect of our roll-out. We seek locations where our stores are highly visible, preferably adjacent to regional malls or other high-traffic shopping areas.
 With our larger DXL store format, we are able to provide our customers a spacious store with up to three times the product offering of a Casual Male XL store. The merchandise in our DXL stores is organized by lifestyle: active, traditional, modern and denim with a representation of all of our brands and price points, utilizing a “good, better, best” pricing structure. Depending on the customers in each respective market, we can adjust the appropriate mix of merchandise, with varying selections from each of our price points, to cater to each demographic market. This larger store format also provides us the footprint necessary to carry a complete offering of dress wear, including tailored and “made-to-measure” custom clothing, as well as a selection of shoes in extended sizes and a broad assortment of accessories such as belts, ties, and socks. 
 During fiscal 2016, we opened 26 DXL retail stores and 4 DXL outlet stores, bringing our store count at January 28, 2017 to 192 DXL retail stores and 13 DXL outlet stores. For fiscal 2016, the average sales per square foot for our DXL retail stores increased to $180 as compared to $177 for fiscal 2015 and $165 for fiscal 2014. Once a DXL store matures, which we believe is five years, we expect sales will be approximately $200-220 per square foot. For fiscal 2016, we had 49 DXL retail stores that had sales greater than $200 per square foot.  For fiscal 2017, we plan to open 19 DXL retail stores and 1 DXL outlet store resulting in approximately 225 DXL retail and outlet stores operating at the end of fiscal 2017. 
 Casual Male XL retail stores 
 At January 28, 2017, we operated 97 Casual Male XL full-price retail stores, located primarily in strip centers, power centers or stand-alone locations. The majority of the merchandise carried in our Casual Male XL stores is moderate-priced basic or fashion-neutral items, such as jeans, casual slacks, t-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts and suit separates. These stores also carry a full complement of our “better” private label collections. The average Casual Male XL retail store is approximately 3,500 square feet. 
 DXL outlet /Casual Male XL outlet stores
 At January 28, 2017, we operated 36 Casual Male XL and 13 DXL outlet stores designed to offer a wide range of casual clothing for the big & tall customer at prices that are generally 20-25% lower than our moderate-priced merchandise. Much of the merchandise in our outlet stores is offered with the purchasing interests of the value-oriented customer in mind. In addition to private-label and branded merchandise at our “good” price tier, our outlets also carry clearance product obtained from DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores, offering the outlet customer the ability to purchase branded and fashion product for a reduced price. As we 
 
6


open our DXL stores, we expect the mix of branded product flowing into the outlets to increase to approximately 30% as we move inventory out of our DXL stores to keep it current while enhancing the branded presence in our outlets. 
 The average Casual Male XL outlet store is approximately 3,100 square feet and the average DXL outlet is approximately 5,000 square feet.   
 Rochester Clothing stores 
 At January 28, 2017, we operated 5 Rochester Clothing stores, located in major cities in the United States and one store in London, England. The Rochester Clothing stores have a wide selection of our “best” merchandise which consists primarily of high-end merchandise from well-recognized brands. In addition, the stores also carry a few private-label lines especially designed for our high-end customer. The average Rochester Clothing store is approximately 10,000 square feet. Although some of our Rochester Clothing stores will close over the next few fiscal years as we open DXL stores in the same geographical market, we currently expect that 3 of our high-traffic Rochester Clothing stores will remain open. 
DIRECT CHANNEL 
 Our direct business, which consists primarily of our e-commerce business, is a vital part of our growing omni-channel business approach, allowing us to service our customers whether it be in-person at a store, over the telephone, or online via a computer, smartphone or tablet. Our direct business bridges that gap for us by encouraging and expecting our store associates to use our e-commerce sites to help fulfill our customers’ clothing needs. If a wider selection of a lifestyle, color or size of an item is not available in our store, then our store associates can order the item for our customer through our direct channel and have it shipped to the store or directly to the customer. Our customers also have the ability to order online and pick-up in store on the same day.  
 With the ability to showcase all store inventories online, we are seeing an increase in the number of transactions that are initiated online but are ultimately completed in store.  Until fiscal 2014, our direct customer was limited to inventory available in our centralized distribution center but we can now fulfill from the store an item that is out-of-stock in our warehouse.  This capability has not only resulted in incremental sales, but it has also helped us reduce clearance merchandise at the store level and improve long-term margins. 
 Destination XL® E-Commerce Site 
 In fiscal 2013, we combined all of our then-existing web addresses: www.casualmalexl.com, www.rochesterclothing.com, www.btdirect.com, www.livingxl.com and www.shoesxl.com and redirected our users to our new comprehensive Destination XL website.  Similar to our DXL store concept, our www.destinationxl.com website allows our customers to shop across all of our brands and product extensions with ease and brings all of our customers to one website.  Our customers were previously classified as a “Rochester” customer or a “Casual Male” customer.  Now, our customers are all “DXL” customers, which no longer limits a customer’s ability to access our full product assortment. 
 From the Destination XL homepage, customers can search across all of our brands and, similar to our stores, shop merchandise from value-oriented to luxury price points.  In addition, a customer can tailor their search using our “size profile.”  Our Destination XL website also offers a complete line of men’s footwear in extended sizes, offering our customers a full range of footwear in hard-to-find sizes.  Although our DXL stores all have a selection of footwear available, we are able to offer a full assortment of sizes and styles through our website.  The assortment is a reflection of our apparel, with a broad assortment from moderate to luxury and from casual to formal. We currently have a selection of more than 600 styles of shoes, ranging in sizes from 10W to 18M and widths up to 6E. We carry a number of designer brands including Cole Haan®, Allen Edmonds®, Timberland®, Calvin Klein®, Lacoste®, Donald J. Pliner and Bruno Magli®.
 In addition to our Destination XL website, our customers can also access our LivingXL website directly from our homepage.  LivingXL is an online-only store that specializes in the selling of select high-quality products which help larger people maintain a more comfortable lifestyle. The types of products sold on our website benefit both men and women and include chairs, outdoor accessories, travel accessories, bed and bath and fitness equipment. 
 In recent years, we have seen a significant increase in the number of visitors to our websites from a mobile device. Our mobile optimized website, m.destinationxl.com, helps our customers browse products, checkout, access our loyalty program information, research inventory in a local store, and find a local store location. For our international customers, upon entering our full site, these visitors are identified based on where they reside globally and are able to shop in their local currency. In addition, checkout is customized based on their location, with local payment methods and a guaranteed cost including shipping and taxes. In fiscal 2016, we launched an effort to ensure that our websites are accessible to the visually impaired. We also launched t.destinationxl.com, an 
 
7


optimized site for tablet visitors to provide an improved shopping experience for all our DXL online visitors, regardless of the device they are using.
 BigandTall.com
 Our www.bigandtall.com website is separate from our Destination XL site and caters to a value-oriented customer, exclusively offering an assortment of promotional and clearance merchandise.
 MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND ALLOCATION 
 Our merchandise planning and allocation area is critical to the effective management of our inventory, store assortments, product sizes and overall gross margin profitability. The merchandise planning and allocation team has an array of planning and replenishment tools available to assist in maintaining an appropriate level of inventory, in-stock positions at the store and for the direct channel, and pre-season planning for product assortments for each store and the direct channel. Additionally, in-season reporting identifies opportunities and challenges in inventory performance. Over the past several years, we have made investments in implementing best practice tools and processes for our merchandise planning and allocation. 
 Our core basic merchandise makes up over 40% of our “better” assortment and over 20% of our “best” assortment. Our planning and allocation team estimates quantity and demand several months in advance to optimize gross margin and minimize end-of-season merchandise for all seasonal merchandise. We have implemented an omni-channel approach towards our assortment planning methodology that customizes each store’s assortment to accentuate lifestyle preferences for each store. 
 Our merchandising data warehouse provides the merchandising team with standardized reporting for monitoring assortment performance by product category and by store, identifying in-stock positions by size and generally monitoring overall inventory levels relative to selling. At season end, we analyze the overall performance of product categories, overall assortments and specific styles by store to focus on the opportunities and challenges for the next season’s planning cycle. 
 During each season, we utilize a markdown optimization tool to monitor the selling performance of our fashion assortments and compare against the planned selling curves. When actual selling performance significantly drops below planned selling curves, we make in-season pricing adjustments so that we maintain planned levels of residual fashion product at season’s end. 
 Utilizing a set of specific universal reporting tools, we are able to fulfill the daily, weekly and monthly roles and responsibilities of the merchandise planning and allocation team. These reporting tools provide focused and actionable views of the business to optimize the overall assortment by category and by store. We believe that by having all members of the merchandise planning and allocation team follow a standardized set of processes with the use of standardized reporting tools, our inventory performance will be optimized. 
 STORE OPERATIONS 
 We believe that our store associates are the key to creating the highest quality experience for our customer. Over the past several years, we have extensively worked to change the culture in our stores from an operationally-driven organization to a sales-driven, customer-centric organization. Our overall goal is to assist our associates in becoming less task-oriented and more focused on serving the customer. We want our associates to help our customer meet his apparel needs through building his wardrobe; not just selling our customer a single item. In order to accomplish this, we have invested in educating our associates. Our associates have been trained to be clothing experts, capable of accommodating our customer’s style and fit needs with ready-to-wear clothing. Our stores offer on-site tailoring in order to assist customers in receiving a perfect fit. Our training approach provides product knowledge as well as behavioral training.  A key component to the success of this program is finding the right caliber of store associates. Our multi-unit, field management team receives extensive training on recruiting associates with the correct fit for our stores. Our new DXL store management team hires are enrolled in a training program with time spent in one of our two regional training centers.  
 Each new store management team member spends time in a DXL store, working with certified training managers to solidify their training before they are released to their “home” store.  This allows each new store management team to apply the skills learned during training to successfully managing their respective stores. 
 We are able to gauge the effectiveness of our training through measuring sales productivity at each level of the field organization, including individual sales associates. We believe these educational programs, together with monitoring sales metrics to help identify opportunities for further training, will improve sales productivity and strengthen our customer’s brand loyalty. 
 Each DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing store is staffed with a store manager, assistant managers and associates. The store manager is responsible for achieving certain sales and operational targets. Our DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores 
 
8


have an incentive-based commission plan for managers and selling staff to encourage associates to focus on our customer’s wardrobing needs and sales productivity.  Our field organization of stores strives to promote from within; a culture that has been building for 7 years, with approximately 90% of the field organization’s multi-unit managers having managed one of our retail stores.
Our field organization is overseen by our Chief Sales Officer (Senior Vice President of Store Sales & Operations) and Regional Sales Managers, who provide management development and guidance to individual store managers. Each Regional Sales Manager is responsible for hiring and developing store managers at the stores assigned to that Regional Sales Manager’s market, and for the overall operations and profitability of those stores. 
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
 
We believe marketing and advertising are key drivers to increase brand awareness, and thereby increase traffic to our stores. Our marketing focus is on increasing the awareness of our DXL brand so that shoppers think of us when they decide to purchase men’s XL clothing or accessories. With only 4 out of every 10 men knowing who we are, we believe we have an opportunity to build our customer base and increase market share.  During fiscal 2016, we saw our brand awareness drop to 34% from 38% in fiscal 2015.  We believe that our $5.4 million decrease in marketing spend in fiscal 2016 may have contributed to this drop in awareness.  Due to the weakness we saw in the retail market and the lack of store traffic we started to see in September 2016, we decided not to run the Fall/Holiday media campaign and instead shifted some of those funds to digital advertising.  In fiscal 2017, we will be reinvesting in our marketing initiatives, increasing our marketing spend consistent with previous levels. We expect that our marketing program for fiscal 2017 will include two media campaigns; our Spring campaign, which runs up to Father’s Day, and the return of a Fall/Holiday campaign. In the short-term, for Spring 2017 we will be reusing an older commercial which was the most productive of our previous campaigns in driving traffic and appears to resonate more with our existing customer.
 For fiscal 2016, our active customer count decreased by 2.5%. In fiscal 2017, in addition to adding back media to aid in growing the customer count, we plan to focus more aggressively on customer retention and reactivation programs. Our DXL retail stores have experienced a 28% higher retention rate of customers than our Casual Male XL retail stores. As we open more DXL retail stores and close more Casual Male XL retail stores, we expect that our overall retention rate will continue to improve, but we will be seeking to improve the retention rates in all store formats. 
 In addition to growing the active customer base within DXL stores, we also see opportunity for growth with our “end-of-rack” customer who is defined as a customer with a 38 to 46 inch waist. For fiscal 2016, the “end of rack” segment contributed twice as much in revenue per customer as consumers with waist sizes above 46 inches and visited us 52% more often than consumers with waist sizes 48 inches and above.  
 As we close more of our Casual Male XL stores in fiscal 2017, we will continue our efforts to increase awareness of the DXL brand and convert Casual Male XL customers to our DXL stores. Our focus will continue to be on transitioning our best Casual Male XL customers first, followed by other very active, high-sales-contributing tiers of customers.  For DXL stores opened in existing Casual Male XL markets, between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2015, we have converted 51% of our Casual Male XL’s customers to these DXL stores by the end of fiscal 2016.  This figure is up from 45% at the start of fiscal 2016. 
 In fiscal 2016, we decreased our marketing costs by $5.4 million from fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2017, we will be increasing our marketing spend to approximately $25.0 million, similar with levels in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, as compared to $18.2 million for fiscal 2016. 
 GLOBAL SOURCING 
 We have strong experience in sourcing internationally, particularly in Asia, where we manufacture a significant percentage of our private-label merchandise. We have established relationships with some of the leading and specialized agents and factories. Our sourcing network consists of over 50 factories in 6 countries. Currently, approximately 61% of all our product needs are sourced directly. 
 Our global sourcing strategy is a balanced approach considering quality, cost and lead time, depending on the requirements of the program. We believe our current sourcing structure is sufficient to meet our operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. The growth and effectiveness of our global direct sourcing program is a key component to our continued merchandise margin improvement. 
 In an effort to minimize foreign currency risk, all payments to our direct sourced vendors and buying agents are made in U.S. dollars through the use of letters of credit or payment on account.

DISTRIBUTION 
 All of our distribution operations are centralized at our headquarters located in Canton, Massachusetts. However, if merchandise is available at the store level but not available at the distribution center, our stores are capable of completing the order and shipping it directly to a customer. 
 We believe that having one centralized distribution facility minimizes the delivered cost of merchandise and maximizes the in-stock position of our stores. We believe that the centralized distribution system enables our stores to maximize selling space by reducing necessary levels of back-room stock carried in each store. In addition, the distribution center provides order fulfillment services for our e-commerce business. 
 Since 2003, we have utilized United Parcel Services (“UPS”) for all of our store shipments as well as our domestic customer deliveries. By utilizing UPS, we are able to track all deliveries from the warehouse to our individual stores, including the status of in-transit shipments. In addition, we are able to provide our Direct-to-Consumer customers with Authorized Return Service and Web labels, making returns more convenient for them.  Our current contract with UPS is through January 5, 2020.  
 In order to service our International customers, we have partnered with a global e-commerce company for payment and shipment services.  Through this service, international customers view and pay for products in their local currency.  Our partner then ships directly to our customer, which we believe helps avoid potential fraud and currency exchange rate risks.
 Our warehousing application for our distribution center systems streamlines our distribution processes, enhances our in-transit times, and reduces our distribution costs substantially. Over the past several years, we have made improvements to our software such as automated packing for single piece orders, barcode scanning technologies and scanning technologies for our sortation systems, in order to improve productivity and to lower packing costs. 
 Our supply chain technology provides visibility for imports, giving our buyers accurate shipping information and allowing the distribution center to plan staffing for arriving freight, resulting in reduced costs and improved receipt efficiency. In fiscal 2017, we plan on improving the domestic routing process by converting from a paper-based to a web-based system that will also help us optimize our domestic inbound transportation costs.  
 In-bound calls for our direct businesses are currently handled at our Canton facility and are primarily fulfilled by our distribution center.  If an order cannot be fulfilled by our distribution center, the order is completed at the store level.  
 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
 The infrastructure of our management information systems has consistently been a priority to us. We believe that the investments we have made in this regard have improved our overall efficiency and most importantly have enabled us to manage our inventory more effectively. 
 Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail merchandising and financial systems which include merchandise planning and reporting, distribution center processing, inventory allocation, sales reporting, and financial processing and reporting. We believe that our current infrastructure provides us the ability and capacity to process transactions more efficiently and provides our management team with comprehensive tools with which to manage our business. 
 Our business is supported by a POS business application that captures daily transaction information by item, color and size. The POS system includes a multitude of features including CRM tools that enable us to track customer buying habits and provides us with the ability to target customers with specific offers and promotions. 
 Using a retail business intelligence solution, we are able to integrate data from several sources and provide enterprise-wide analytics reporting. Over the past few years, we have developed a custom Assortment Suite application that leverages business intelligence and predictive analytics to provide high impact insights into core merchandising tasks. In an effort to further improve our inventory management, we have created a standardized set of “best practices” for both our merchandise planning and allocation groups. 
 Our direct business and retail business maintain a shared inventory system and we operate a single system platform for DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing to deliver improved efficiencies and to make our full product assortment available to all of our business formats. 
 We continually work to improve our web environment. Our mobile optimized site capitalizes on the growing use of mobile devices to look up store information, review product offerings, and complete purchases. In fiscal 2016, we completed the development and

implementation of a tablet optimized website to further capitalize on the continued growth of mobile e-commerce.  In addition, our current website is fully integrated with a global e-commerce company to accommodate international customers by providing multi-currency pricing, payment processing, and international shipping. Functionality was also implemented to support an online custom shirt program and an in-store application to support both a custom suit and custom shirt program. 
 COMPETITION 
 Our business faces competition from a variety of sources, including department stores such as Macy’s and Dillard’s, mass merchandisers, other specialty stores and discount and off-price retailers, as well as other retailers that sell big & tall merchandise. While we have successfully competed on the basis of merchandise selection, comfort and fit, customer service and desirable store locations, there can be no assurances that other retailers, including e-commerce retailers, will not adopt purchasing and marketing concepts similar to ours. Discount retailers with significant buying power, such as Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney, represent a source of competition for us. The direct business has several competitors, including the King Size catalog and website. 
 The United States men’s big & tall apparel market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, specialty apparel retailers, single market operators and discount stores offering a broad range of apparel products similar to ours. Besides retail competitors, we consider any casual apparel manufacturer operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor in the casual apparel market. We believe that we are the only national operator of apparel stores focused on the men’s big & tall market. 
 SEASONALITY 
 Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations as it relates to our operating income and net income. Traditionally, a significant portion of our operating income and net income is generated in the fourth quarter, as a result of the holiday season.
