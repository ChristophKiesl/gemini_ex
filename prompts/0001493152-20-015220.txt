Corporate History
 
Our company was originally incorporated on October 17, 2005 in Nevada under the name “Loma Verde Inc.” Our company was initially formed for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties and was therefore considered to be in the pre-exploration stage. Mineral claims with unknown reserves were acquired, but we did not establish the existence of commercially mineable ore deposits and we decided to abandon our mineral claims and to pursue other business opportunities, one of which was the alternative energy business.
 
On March 23, 2007, we engaged in a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary, “Clean Power Concepts, Inc.,” for the purpose of changing our name. On April 2, 2007, we amended our Articles and we changed our corporate name from Loma Verde, Inc. to Clear Power Concepts, Inc. On July 23, 2013, our company redomiciled and changed its corporate jurisdiction from the State of Nevada to the State of Wyoming. On July 23, 2013, we filed Articles of Domestication with the State of Wyoming. On April 15, 2015, we amended our Articles to change our corporate name to “General Bio Health, Inc.” On May 18, 2016, we amended our Articles to change our corporate name back to “Clean Power Concepts, Inc.” On January 18, 2019, we amended our Articles to change our corporate name to “Hemp Technology, Inc.”

On April 29, 2010, through a share exchange agreement, we acquired 94.8% of the issued and outstanding common shares of General Bio Energy Inc. (“GBE”), a Saskatchewan Corporation. Following this acquisition, GBE became our subsidiary. At that time, we changed our business focus to the operation of the business conducted by GBE, which was focused on the environmentally friendly green energy industry. General Bio Energy Inc. was incorporated in the Province of Saskatchewan in February 2006 under the name “Canadian Green Fuels Inc.” and changed its name to “General Bio Energy Inc.” in September 2008. General Bio Energy Inc. commenced its pre-production stage in May 2006 and began selling products in July 2008. From 2008 to 2011, we were engaged in the development of a bioenergy business focused on agricultural processing and the environmentally friendly green energy industry. We produced a range of products manufactured by crushing oilseeds and refining the by-products. Our subsidiary, GBE, operated a fully integrated commercial oilseed crushing, bio-diesel refinery, which used its proprietary processes to produce two main co-products, oil and meal, each of which were further processed and then sold. The oil products produced from this process could be divided into three subcategories: (i) vegetable oil for human and animal consumption; (ii) biofuel and biofuel additives; and (iii) environmental lubricants and conditioners, penetrating sprays, dust suppressants, cutting oils and other “ECO-lubricants”. We also added a new group of oil products to our product mix: natural consumer health products. The meal and protein related products were used for agricultural and aquaculture feedstock. We considered our facility to be a “green” manufacturing facility because it had minimal effluents, using methods which are emissions friendly. Our production facility and head office was located in Regina, Saskatchewan.
 
From 2012 to 2018, we focused on clearing our debts from prior biofuels operations by issuing shares in exchange for the settlement of these liabilities, and on seeking new business opportunities.
 
Narrative Description of Business
 
On January 18, 2019, we amended our Articles and changed our name from “Clean Power Concepts, Inc.” to “Hemp Technology Inc.” and we announced a new business plan in the emerging hemp-derived cannabidiol (“CBD”) business. We hired new management to carry out these plans and raised $0.3 million seed capital between March and September 2019 to commence the process.
 
On November 19, 2018, we incorporated subsidiaries in Kentucky and acquired two licenses to process hemp. The subsidiaries are: Hemp Technology Inc., incorporated under the laws of Kentucky, and Hemp Biotech Inc., also incorporated under the laws of Kentucky.

Governmental Regulations
 
United States
 
In December 2018, the U.S. 2018 Farm Bill was passed; the bill officially removes hemp and all of its derivatives from the Controlled Substances Act. The U.S. 2018 Farm Bill, however, explicitly preserved the authority of the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA treats products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning they are subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance. This is true regardless of whether the cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds are classified as hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill. Even with the 2018 Farm Bill, state or local governments can impose stricter limitations

Environmental Laws
 
We would operate in compliance with all state and federal environmental regulations throughout our facilities and operations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations require the maintenance of water and air quality standards as well as land reclamation. They establish limitations on storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. Environmental laws and regulations are evolving in a manner which will mandate stronger enforcement and standards, higher fines and penalties with non-compliance of proposed projects and a higher degree of responsibility for companies and their executive and employees. These stronger regulations may adversely affect our operations going forward.
 
If we fail to comply with local and federal environmental laws and regulations this may result in enforcement actions which would include orders issued by the regulatory authorities causing our operations to cease or be restricted, which may include us to take added measures that would require added capital expenditures, installation of new equipment, or other corrective actions. We also may be required pay for any losses or damage due to our operations and we may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of any laws or regulations.
