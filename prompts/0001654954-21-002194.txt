 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  General
  
 We were incorporated on July 17, 2006 under the laws of British Columbia, Canada under the name Golden Predator Mines Inc. We were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Metals Corp. for the purpose of holding precious metals and certain specialty metals assets. In order to focus on specialty metals, during February 2009 we transferred most of our precious mineral assets to our then wholly-owned subsidiary Golden Predator Corp., and on March 6, 2009 we completed a spin-out of Golden Predator Corp. to our shareholders. Effective March 12, 2009, we changed our name to EMC Metals Corp. In order to reflect a new emphasis on mining for scandium minerals, effective November 19, 2014, we changed our name to Scandium International Mining Corp (“SCY” or the “Company”).
  
 We are a reporting issuer in the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and our common shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “SCY.”
  
 Our head office is located at 1430 Greg Street, Suite 501, Sparks, Nevada 89431. The address of our registered office is 1200 - 750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T8.

 Our primary development project is the Nyngan Scandium Project, located in New South Wales, Australia (the “Nyngan Scandium Project”), on which we hold a mine lease grant and a development consent. We also hold an exploration license on a scandium mineral property located nearby Nyngan known as the “Honeybugle Scandium property” and a reservation on an exploration license on a scandium mineral property in Finland, known as the “Kiviniemi Scandium property.” In addition to these scandium mining project interests, the Company is pursuing copper industry interest in our ion exchange (IX) technology and knowhow to recover scandium, nickel, cobalt and other technology-driven metals from mineral processing solutions, and other acidic waste streams in certain acid leach copper operations. This project effort is known as the “Critical Metals Recovery (CMR) Project,” with a specific focus on North American opportunities.
  
 Our plan of operation for the remainder of 2021 is to obtain copper industry partners for our ion exchange (IX) technology, and to subsequently secure offtake sales agreements with counterparties for those critical metals planned to be produced at participating separation sites. The Company continues to pursue scandium product customers for offtakes, either from critical metals projects or from the Nyngan Scandium Project product. We will seek additional funding for corporate working capital in 2021, and also for advanced development of an approved CMR Project, once that project is identified.

  Business Operations
  
  Company Summary
  
 We are a mineral exploration and development company that is primarily focused on the development of scandium mineral resources, and scandium end-use markets, through identification of value-added applications for scandium in aluminum alloys and end products. The Company has also considered exploration and project development opportunities in rare earth minerals, and other specialty metals, specifically including nickel, cobalt, boron, manganese, tantalum, titanium, zirconium and high-purity alumina (HPA). We have not commenced construction on of any of our scandium projects, and as a result we are an exploration stage company.
  
 Our principal project is the Nyngan Scandium Project located in New South Wales, Australia, in which we own 100% of the mineral rights. The Company is in possession of both a development consent and a mining lease grant on the property that corresponds to a definitive feasibility study on the Nyngan Scandium Project dated May 4, 2016 (the “Feasibility Study” or “DFS”), which was prepared independently in accordance with NI 43-101. The results of the DFS include a 16.9 million tonne measured and indicated resource (grading 235ppm at a 100ppm cut-off) and a 1.43 million tonne mineral reserve (combined proven and probable), based on economics established in that study. The DFS was filed on May 6, 2016 and is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com), on the Company’s website (www.scandiummining.com) and on the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). A summary of the DFS is provided herein under “Item 2. Properties – Description of Mineral Projects – Nyngan Scandium Project – Nyngan Feasibility Study.”
  
 The Company also holds exploration licenses on two separate scandium-prospective properties:
    ●
 an exploration license on the Honeybugle Scandium property, located 24 kilometers from the Nyngan Scandium Project, granted in 2014; and

   ●
 an exploration license on the Kiviniemi Scandium Property a scandium-prospective property in central Finland, granted in 2018.

 
 In addition, the Company is currently pursuing copper industry interest in our ion exchange (IX) technology and knowhow to recover various critical metals (usually including scandium) from mineral processing solutions and other acidic waste streams present in acid leach copper operations. This effort has a principal focus on opportunities in North America.
  
  Corporate Objectives and Strategy
  
 Our corporate focus is in the development of projects that enable the production and sale of scandium and scandium-based products. That scandium focus has now been expanded to include other specialty metals, identified by the US Department of Commerce in 2018 on a list of 35 critical metals, which specifically includes scandium. In this regard, the Company is pursuing various host project opportunities that can produce a basket of metal products, including scandium, along with other technology-driven critical metals.
  
 The Nyngan Scandium Project remains the most advanced project in the Company portfolio at this time, with permitting largely complete and a published DFS on SEDAR. Subject to successful construction financing and customer sales agreements, we intend to develop the Nyngan Scandium Project for production and supply of scandium oxide and scandium-content products. The Company has been successful in developing capability to manufacture an aluminum-scandium master alloy product, specifically for sale to aluminum alloy customers. This additional product capability enhances the Company’s ability to sell scandium-containing products to the aluminum industry, and potentially generate additional margins in certain markets. For further information on the Nyngan Scandium Project, please refer to “Item 2. Properties - Description of Mineral Projects – Nyngan Scandium Project” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
  
 The Company is independently pursuing opportunities to deploy both ion exchange (IX) and solvent extraction (SX) separation technologies and knowhow to recover critical metals from mineral processing solutions and acidic waste streams, commonly found in copper leaching operations. The critical metals present are dependent on the specific operation, and value depends on concentration, but cobalt, nickel and scandium represent key targets for recovery. This strategy depends on SCY’s ability to identify suitable mine operations with acceptable economics and to establish hosting arrangements with existing mine operators that will support attractive project returns. For further information on our ion exchange technology, please refer to “Item 2. Properties - Description of Mineral Projects – Critical Metals Recovery Technology Program” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

  Global Scandium Production and Market
  
 Scandium is the 31st most abundant element in the earth’s crust (average 33 ppm), which makes it more common than lead, mercury, and precious metals, but less common than copper. Scandium has characteristics that are similar to rare earth elements, and it is often classified as a member of that group, although it is technically a light transition metal. Scandium occurs in nature as an oxide, rarely occurs in concentrated quantities because it does not selectively combine with the common ore-forming anions, and is very difficult to reduce to a pure metal state. Scandium is typically produced and sold as scandium oxide (Sc2O3), more properly known as scandia.
  
 Global annual production estimates of scandium range from 15 tonnes to 20 tonnes, but accurate statistics are not available due to the lack of public information from countries in which scandium is currently being produced. There are five known, primary production sources globally today: stockpiles from the former Zhovti Voty uranium mine in Ukraine, the rare earth mine at Bayan Obo in China, apatite mines on the Kola Peninsula in Russia, by-product production from titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment refiners in China, and recent start-up production of scandium oxide concentrates from the Taganito Nickel Mine in the Philippines (Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd.). Recent announcements from Rio Tinto indicate their Quebec titanium feedstock producer, Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (RTFT), is planning to initiate small scale scandium production in 2021, with expansion capability planned for the future.
  
 There is no reliable pricing data on global scandium oxide trading. The U.S. Geological Survey (“USGS”) in its latest available report (dated January 2021) documents the 2020 price of scandium oxide (99.99% grade) at US$3,800/kg, indicating a reduction from the 2019 price estimate of US$3,900/kg. Small quantities of scandium oxide, suitable for laboratory investigations, are currently offered on the internet by traders for prices at this level. Larger quantities of oxide product at varying purities are available at considerably lower prices, typically below US$2,000/kg. Scandium oxide grades of 95% or greater are considered commercially suitable, with 99.9% grade used for electrical applications, and grades higher than 99.9% reserved for science and new technical applications. Scandium oxide grades of 95-99% are generally considered suitable for aluminum alloy applications.
  
 Scandium oxide is typically traded in small quantities, between private parties, and pricing is not transparent to other buyers or sellers as there is no clearing facility as is more common with commercially traded metals and commodities. Prices do vary, based on purity and quantity supplied. Small sale quantities tend to command premium prices, and large quantities (over one tonne) are simply not available to establish appropriate commercial pricing.
  
 Scandium can also be effectively purchased in the form of aluminum-scandium (Al-Sc) master alloy, typically containing 2% scandium by weight. This product is the preferred form for manufacture of aluminum alloys containing scandium. The latest available 2021 USGS report indicates the 2020 price for Al-Sc 2% master alloy at US$340/kg, somewhat higher than the 2019 USGS average. Recent USGS estimated prices for Al-Sc 2% master alloy have also been high relative to commonly available prices, which have trended under US$100/kg and are available in one tonne lots or greater today.
  
 Principal uses for scandium are in high-strength aluminum alloys, high-intensity metal halide lamps, electronics, and laser research. Recently developed applications include welding wire and fuel cells which are expected to be in future demand. Approximately 15 different commercial aluminum-scandium alloys have been developed, and some of them are used for aerospace applications. In Europe and the U.S., scandium-containing alloys have been evaluated for use in structural parts in commercial airplanes and high stress parts in automobile engines and brake systems. Military and aerospace applications are known to be of interest, although with less specificity. The combination of high strength, weldability and ductility makes aluminum-scandium alloys potentially attractive replacements for existing aluminum alloys in a number of applications where improved alloy properties can add value to final products.
  
  Competitive Conditions
  
  We compete with numerous other companies and individuals in the search for and the acquisition or control of attractive rare earth and specialty metals mineral properties. Our ability to acquire further properties will depend not only on our ability to operate and develop our properties but also on our ability to select and acquire suitable properties or prospects for development or mineral exploration.
  
  In regard to our plan to produce scandium, there are a limited number of scandium producers presently. If we are successful at becoming a producer of scandium, our ability to be competitive will require that we establish a reliable supply of scandium to the market, delivered at purity levels demanded by various applications, and that our operating costs generate margins at prices that will be set by customers and competitors in a market yet to mature.
