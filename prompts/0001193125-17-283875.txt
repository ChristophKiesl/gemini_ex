Introduction 
 Our Business 
 We develop sustained-release drug delivery products that deliver drugs at a controlled and steady rate for months or years. We have developed three of the four sustained-release ophthalmic products currently approved by the FDA for treatment of back-of-the-eye diseases. Our product development programs are focused primarily 
 
2 
 
 on utilizing our core Durasert technology platform to deliver drugs to treat chronic diseases. Durasert three-year uveitis is our most advanced development-stage product, and is designed to treat chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (posterior segment uveitis) for approximately three years. Durasert three-year uveitis met its primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of uveitis through six months with a p value of < 0.001 in two ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. We anticipate filing an NDA with the FDA in late December 2017 or early January 2018. In July 2017, we amended our collaboration agreement (the Prior Alimera Agreement) with Alimera to, among other things, license distribution, regulatory and reimbursement matters for Durasert three-year uveitis (under the ILUVIEN trademark) for the EMEA to Alimera. Pursuant to the Prior Alimera Agreement, our lead licensed product, ILUVIEN® for DME, is sold by Alimera in the U.S. and multiple EU countries. Our strategy includes developing non-proprietary drugs independently in combination with our Durasert technology platform, while continuing to leverage our technology platform through collaborations and license agreements as appropriate. 
 Injected into the eye in an office visit, Durasert three-year uveitis is a micro-insert that delivers a micro-dose of a corticosteroid to the back of the eye on a sustained basis for approximately three years after a single administration. In Europe, we filed a marketing authorization application (MAA) in June 2017 and subsequently withdrew the application after out-licensing the European rights for Durasert to Alimera. Alimera plans to submit the Durasert three-year uveitis data under its existing ILUVIEN MAA and, if approved, to commercialize the uveitis indication under the ILUVIEN trademark. 
 We are developing Durasert three-year uveitis independently and we plan to file an NDA with the FDA in late December 2017 or early January 2018. Both of our Durasert three-year uveitis Phase 3 clinical trials met their primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of uveitis through six months with statistical significance (p < 0.001; intent to treat analysis) and yielded safety profiles consistent with the known effects of ocular corticosteroid use. Similar efficacy and safety results have been observed through 12 months of follow-up in the first pivotal trial and twelve-month data from the second pivotal trial is expected in the first half of calendar year 2018. Pending NDA submission and approval by the FDA, we plan to independently commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the U.S. given the relatively modest market size and correspondingly limited commercial footprint required to launch on our own. 
 ILUVIEN, an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert delivering 0.19mg of FA to the back of the eye for the treatment of DME, was licensed to and developed with Alimera under the Prior Alimera Agreement. In July 2017, we entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement with Alimera (the Amended Alimera Agreement) pursuant to which we (i) licensed the rights to our three-year uveitis indication to Alimera for the EMEA and (ii) converted our license consideration from a share of Alimeras net profits for ILUVIEN to a royalty based on Alimeras net sales for ILUVIEN for DME and, upon an MAA approval, for net sales of ILUVIEN for posterior segment uveitis. Sales-based royalties start at the rate of 2% effective as of July 1, 2017. Commencing January 1, 2019 (or earlier under certain circumstances), the sales-based royalty will increase to 6% (8% on total ILUVIEN net sales in excess of $75 million on a calendar year basis). Alimeras share of contingently recoverable accumulated ILUVIEN commercialization losses under the original net profit share arrangement (as set forth in the Prior Alimera Agreement), was capped at $25 million. Under the Amended Alimera Agreement those recoverable losses will be reduced as follows: (i) $10.0 million was cancelled in lieu of an upfront license fee on the effective date of the Amended Alimera Agreement; (ii) for calendar years 2019 and 2020, 50% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% of net sales will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments otherwise due from Alimera; (iii) on January 1, 2020 (or earlier under certain circumstances), another $5 million will be cancelled, provided, however, that such date of cancellation may be extended under certain circumstances related to Alimeras regulatory approval process for ILUVIEN for posterior segment uveitis, with such extension, if any, subject to mutual agreement by the parties; and (iv) commencing in calendar year 2021, 20% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% of net sales will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments due from Alimera until such time as the remaining balance of the original $25 million of recoverable commercialization losses has been fully recouped.

We believe that the terms of the Amended Alimera Agreement for ILUVIEN for DME have standardized and simplified the agreement, and improved the potential total value of the agreement for us. ILUVIEN for DME has been sold by Alimera in the U.S. since 2015, where it is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients previously treated with a course of corticosteroids without a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). Alimera has marketing approvals for ILUVIEN in 17 European countries, where it is approved for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. ILUVIEN for DME has been sold by Alimera in the U.K. and Germany since 2013, in Portugal since 2015 and in Italy, Spain and certain Middle East countries (through sublicense partners) since the second quarter of calendar year 2017. 
 FDA-approved Retisert® is an implant that provides sustained treatment of posterior segment uveitis for 30 months that was co-developed with and licensed to Bausch & Lomb. Implanted in a surgical procedure, Retisert delivers the same corticosteroid as Durasert but in a larger dose. We receive royalties from Retisert sales. 
 We are also using our Durasert technology platform to identify potential product candidates that provide sustained treatment of wet and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, osteoarthritis and other diseases. In collaboration with Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), we are developing a sustained-release surgical implant to treat pain associated with severe knee OA. This product is currently being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored pilot clinical study that is expected to provide initial results in late calendar year 2017. We are also conducting nonclinical evaluations of various tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) candidates for wet AMD. Finally, we are developing a next-generation Durasert shorter-acting version, initially for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis. 
 We have received Notices of Allowance for UVIEY, YUTIQ and DELIVERING INNOVATION TO THE EYE, and our Durasert mark has been published, in the United States. Retisert® and Vitrasert® are Bausch & Lombs trademarks. ILUVIEN® is Alimeras trademark. This Annual Report also contains trademarks, trade names and service marks of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners. 
 Information with respect to ILUVIEN, including regulatory and marketing information, and Alimeras plans and intentions, reflects information publicly disclosed by Alimera. 
 Fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 mean the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and fiscal 2018 means the twelve months ending June 30, 2018. 
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to use our proprietary Durasert drug delivery technology platform to independently develop new drug delivery products that use already-approved drugs to better treat ophthalmic and other diseases, while continuing to leverage our technology platform through collaborations and licenses with leading pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, institutions and others. We believe our technologies can provide sustained, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents, resulting in improved therapeutic effectiveness, safer administration and better patient compliance and convenience, with reduced product development risk and cost. We believe that our proven track record of three approved products, all providing sustained release of previously approved drugs, reflects the benefits of this strategy. 

 | Develop Sustained Delivery of Off-Patent Drugs. Many drugs are now, or will soon be, off-patent. It is estimated that over the next several years, patent coverage will end on products with world-wide sales aggregating billions of dollars annually. We are using our technology platform to evaluate potential products that deliver off-patent and generic drugs, primarily focused on ocular diseases with significant market opportunities, where less frequent dosing through sustained delivery and/or targeted delivery at the treatment site would materially improve the effectiveness, safety or convenience of the original drug. By focusing on delivery of already-approved drugs, particularly those requiring potentially shorter clinical development programs, we believe we may be able to reduce the substantial risks and financial investment required for product approval.

 | Continue Partnering with Leading Biopharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Companies. We intend to continue to partner with leading biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, institutions and others, where patent protection, development and regulatory costs, expertise and/or other factors make it desirable for us to have a partner. For example, drugs that might be more effectively delivered by our platform technology or may have extended patent protection could make collaborations with the patent holders attractive. We may also seek to partner the development of products that could materially benefit from sustained delivery, but would require expensive clinical trials or are in treatment areas outside of our technical expertise. We may also seek to partner with companies with drugs coming off patent where our drug delivery technology could offer an improved product and effectively extend patent protection.

 | Expand Beyond Ophthalmology. While we continue to focus on our core ophthalmic competency, we intend to also use our technology platform for the treatment of other diseases where sustained delivery could provide a significant advantage, such as osteoarthritis.

Market Opportunity for Delivery of Drugs 
 We develop products to address issues inherent in the delivery of drugs. The efficacy of a therapeutic agent (small drug molecule) depends on its distribution to, and reaction with, the targeted tissue and other tissues in the body, the duration of treatment and clearance from the body. In an ideal treatment, the appropriate amount of drug is delivered to the intended tissue at an appropriate concentration and that concentration is maintained at the tissue for a sufficient period of time to provide effective treatment without causing adverse effects to other tissues. Accordingly, the delivery of a drug can be an important element of its ultimate therapeutic value. 
 Drugs are frequently administered systemically by oral dosing, infusion or injection and subsequently dispersed throughout the body via the circulatory system. In the case of some drugs, systemic administration does not deliver them to the intended site with an appropriate concentration for a sufficient duration or the appropriate concentration disperses too quickly or unevenly, thereby failing to achieve the maximum potential therapeutic benefit. Because systemically delivered drugs disperse throughout the body, some are administered at higher dosage levels to achieve sufficient concentrations at the intended sites. This is particularly true for the eyes, joints, brain and nervous system, which have natural barriers that impede the movement of drugs to those areas. These higher dosage levels can cause harmful side effects to the tissues beyond the intended site. To avoid these issues, drugs may be administered locally to the targeted site, typically by injection. However, maintaining a sufficient concentration at the targeted site over time typically requires timely and repeated administration of systemically and locally delivered drugs. The delivery methods themselves can have risks. Repeated administration by injection or infusion can result in serious infections and other complications. 
 Drugs are often not administered on the optimal schedule or at all, because patients do not self-administer as prescribed or do not get medical professional administration as required. The risk of patient noncompliance increases when treatment involves multiple products or complex or painful dosing regimens, as patients age or suffer cognitive impairment or serious illness, or when the treatment is lengthy or expensive. 
 Treating retinal diseases is a significant challenge for drug delivery. Due to the effectiveness of the blood-eye barrier, it is difficult for systemically administered drugs to reach the retina in sufficient quantities to have a beneficial effect without causing adverse side effects to other parts of the body. Injecting drugs in solution directly into the back of the eye can achieve effective, but often transient, dosage levels in the eye, requiring repeated injections. In addition to the issues of inconvenience, cost and noncompliance, repeated intravitreal injections have medical risks, including intraocular infection, perforated sclera and vitreous hemorrhage. 
 Due to the drawbacks of traditional delivery, we believe that the development of methods to deliver drugs to patients in a more precise, controlled fashion over sustained periods of time satisfies an unmet medical need. Methods for sustained drug delivery include oral and injectable controlled-release products and skin patches that seek to improve the 
 
5 
 
 consistency of the dosage over time and extend the duration of delivery. However, most of these methods cannot provide constant, controlled dosage or sufficient duration of delivery, particularly in diseases that are chronic or require precise dosing. Moreover, skin patches and oral products still have issues of systemic delivery. 
 As a result of the issues with traditional delivery of drugs, we believe there is significant market opportunity for delivery of these products on a sustained, controlled basis over an extended period directly to the targeted site. 
 Our Technology System and Products 
 Our core technology platform, Durasert, is designed to address the issue of sustained delivery for ophthalmic and other product candidates: 
 

 | Extended Delivery. Our Durasert technology platform can deliver drugs for predetermined periods of time ranging from months to years. We believe that uninterrupted, sustained delivery offers the opportunity to develop products that reduce the need for repeated applications, thereby reducing the risks of patient noncompliance and adverse effects from repeated administrations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Controlled Release Rate. Our Durasert technology platform is designed to release therapeutics at a sustained, controlled rate. We believe that this feature allows us to develop products that deliver optimal concentrations of therapeutics over time and eliminate excessive variability in dosing during treatment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Localized Delivery. Our technology platform can deliver therapeutics directly to a target site. This administration can allow the natural barriers of the body to isolate and assist in maintaining appropriate concentrations at the target site in an effort to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect while minimizing unwanted systemic effects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Durasert Technology System 
 All of our commercially approved products and all our product candidates in development use our Durasert technology platform to provide sustained, localized delivery of small molecule drugs to the back of the eye or a joint. In our Durasert products and product candidates, a drug core is surrounded with one or more polymer layers, and the permeability of those layers and other design aspects of the product control the rate and duration of drug release. By changing elements of the design, we can alter both the rate and duration of release to meet different therapeutic needs. Although our earlier ophthalmic products Retisert and Vitrasert are surgically implanted, both ILUVIEN and our other ophthalmic product candidates are designed to be injected at the target site in an office visit. Our osteoarthritis product candidate is designed to be surgically implanted in the knee joint.

 Approved Product: ILUVIEN for DME 
 ILUVIEN is an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert delivering 0.19 mg of FA to the back of the eye for treatment of DME. The ILUVIEN micro-insert is substantially the same micro-insert as Durasert. ILUVIEN is injected in an office visit using a 25-gauge inserter, and delivers approximately 36 months of continuous, low-dose corticosteroid therapy with a single injection. ILUVIEN is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in IOP. In the 17 EU countries where ILUVIEN has been approved, it is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. DME is a disease suffered by diabetics where leaking capillaries cause swelling in the macula, the most sensitive part of the retina. DME is a leading cause of blindness in the working-age population in most developed countries. 
 We have licensed ILUVIEN to Alimera. Alimera has sold ILUVIEN in the U.K. and Germany since 2013, in Portugal and the U.S. since 2015, has commenced distribution through sublicense partners in the second quarter of 2017 in Spain, Italy and various countries in the Middle East and Alimera recently announced a new sublicense partner for France. ILUVIEN has marketing authorizations in 12 additional EU countries. Effective July 1, 2017, in connection with the Amended Alimera Agreement, we are entitled to receive royalties on net sales by Alimera of ILUVIEN for DME and all future approved indications (including for three-year uveitis in 
 
7 
 
 the EMEA) on a quarter-by-quarter, country-by-country basis. See Strategic CollaborationsAlimera below. Alimera has also sublicensed regulatory, reimbursement and distribution of ILUVIEN for DME in various other countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Canada. 
 Approved Product: Retisert for Posterior Segment Uveitis 
 Our approved product Retisert is a sustained-release implant for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis. Surgically implanted, it delivers 0.59 mg of FA to the back of the eye for approximately 30 months. Retisert is licensed to Bausch & Lomb, with which we co-developed the product. Approved in the U.S., Bausch & Lomb sells the product and pays sales-based royalties to us. 
Approved Product: Vitrasert for CMV Retinitis 
 Our approved product Vitrasert is a sustained-release implant for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis, a blinding eye disease that occurs in individuals with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Surgically implanted, Vitrasert provided sustained delivery of the anti-viral drug ganciclovir for six to eight months. Approved in the U.S. and EU, Vitrasert was licensed to Bausch & Lomb, which discontinued sales in fiscal 2013 following patent expiration. 
Development Pipeline 
 Our internal research development is focused on using our Durasert technology platform to deliver therapeutic agents to treat uveitis, wet and dry AMD, glaucoma and osteoarthritis. 
 Development Product: Durasert Three-Year Uveitis 
 Durasert three-year uveitis, our lead development product, is an injectable, sustained-release micro-insert designed to treat chronic, noninfectious posterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis and panuveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. Injected in an office visit, Durasert three-year uveitis provides sustained daily release of a total of 0.18 mg of the off-patent corticosteroid FA at a controlled rate directly to the back of the eye over approximately three years, from a single administration. It is injected with our inserter using a 25-gauge needle. We are developing Durasert three-year uveitis independently and have licensed regulatory, reimbursement and distribution rights to Alimera for the EMEA under their ILUVIEN tradename. Pending NDA submission and approval by the FDA, we plan to independently commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the U.S. given the relatively modest market size and correspondingly limited commercial footprint required to launch on our own. 
 Posterior segment uveitis is a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye, often involving the retina, and is a leading cause of blindness in the developed countries. It afflicts people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. In the U.S., posterior segment uveitis is estimated to affect approximately 80,000-120,000 people, resulting in approximately 30,000 cases of blindness and making it the third leading cause of blindness in the U.S. Patients with posterior segment uveitis are typically treated with systemic steroids, but frequently develop serious side effects over time that can limit effective dosing. Patients then often progress to steroid-sparing therapy with systemic immunosuppressants or biologics, which themselves can cause severe side effects including an increased risk of cancer. 
 Durasert Three-Year Uveitis Phase 3 Trials 
 In our two Phase 3 trials to assess the safety and efficacy of Durasert three-year uveitis, we have achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of uveitis through six months with statistical significance (p value of < 0.001 in each study). These studies are randomized, sham injection-controlled, double-masked trials with the primary endpoint of both trials defined as recurrence of disease at six months, with patients followed for three years. Our first Phase 3 trial enrolled 129 patients in 16 centers in the U.S. and 17 centers outside the U.S, with 87 eyes treated with Durasert three-year uveitis and 42 eyes receiving sham injections. Our second Phase 3 trial enrolled 153 patients in 15 centers in India with 101 eyes treated with 
 
8 
 
 Durasert three-year uveitis and 52 eyes receiving sham injections. Patient follow-up will continue for 36 months in each of the two Phase 3 trials. 
 Our first Phase 3 trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of disease at 6 months with statistical significance (p < 0.001, intent to treat analysis; recurrence of 18.4% for Durasert versus 78.6% for control). The trial yielded similar efficacy through 12 months of follow up (p < 0.0001, intent to treat analysis; recurrence of 27.6% for Durasert versus 85.7% for control). Durasert three-year uveitis was generally well tolerated through 12-months of follow-up. The incremental risk of elevated IOP for Durasert-treated eyes compared to control eyes was lower through 12 months than through six months for elevation over 21 mmHg (6.1% versus 10.9%) as well as for the more serious elevation over 25 mmHg (7.6% versus 11.3%). Elevated IOP was generally well treated with eye drops. Through 12 months, the percentage of eyes requiring filtration surgery was low and similar between Durasert-treated and control eyes (3.4% versus 2.4%). Of the 63 study eyes with a natural lens at baseline, 33.3% of Durasert-treated eyes compared to 4.8% of control eyes required cataract surgery through 12 months. Cataracts are both a side effect of treatment with steroids and a natural consequence of uveitis. 
 Our second Phase 3 trial also met its primary efficacy endpoint of prevention of recurrence of disease at 6 months with statistical significance (p < 0.001, intent to treat analysis; recurrence of 21.8% for Durasert versus 53.8% for control). As in the first Phase 3 trial, Durasert three-year uveitis was generally well tolerated through 6 months. Patient follow-up beyond this latest study time point is currently underway and twelve-month data is expected in the first half of calendar year 2018. 
 We are also conducting a multi-center, randomized, controlled, single-masked study of the safety and utilization of two different inserters for Durasert three-year uveitis. We enrolled 26 subjects (38 eyes) in this study in 6 centers in the U.S. The utilization and safety results of this study will be included in our planned NDA filing for Durasert three-year uveitis. 
 Durasert Three-Year Uveitis Regulatory Strategy 
 In the U.S., we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA seeking approval to market Durasert three-year uveitis. We plan to support the NDA with data from our two Phase 3 trials and the inserter utilization study, as well as data referenced from Alimeras Phase 3 clinical trials of ILUVIEN for DME. We expect to file the NDA in late December 2017 or early January 2018. 
 We have out-licensed Durasert three-year uveitis rights to Alimera for the EMEA as an extension of the Prior Alimera Agreement that had granted worldwide license rights to ILUVIEN for DME and other potential back-of-the-eye diseases (other than uveitis) utilizing a corticosteroid in our Durasert technology. In the EU, we expect Alimera to file the Durasert three-year uveitis data as a Type II variation to its previously approved ILUVIEN MAA, and to file in the Middle East and Africa under its respective regulatory applications. 
 Durasert Three-Year Uveitis Marketing Strategy 
 We plan to commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis ourselves in the U.S. We believe that the uveitis market in the U.S. is relatively modest in size, with an estimated patient prevalence for non-infectious posterior segment uveitis of approximately 100,000 patients. Consequently, the number of retinal physicians who treat the majority of this patient population is estimated to be fewer than 500. As a result, we believe the commercial footprint and cost to market for Durasert three-year uveitis will be less than for a typical pharmaceutical product launch with a larger physician call population. Members of our leadership team have extensive commercialization experience and believe that commercializing ourselves in the U.S. will maximize the value of Durasert three-year uveitis to us. Outside of the U.S., we licensed the EMEA rights to Durasert three-year uveitis to Alimera as part of the Amended Alimera Agreement. We plan to seek out-license partner arrangements in other territories.

Development Product: Shorter Duration Durasert 
 We are developing a next-generation, shorter-duration treatment for posterior segment uveitis, and for use in collaborations with other drug manufacturers with their small molecules. This program is designed to provide enhanced benefits and offer a shorter delivery period with more flexibility for multiple dosing intervals. Our market research demonstrated a preference amongst those surveyed for both 6 to 9 months and three-year sustained delivery options. Although we believe many patients would likely opt for a longer-acting treatment option, some doctors may prefer to initially treat certain disease indications over shorter time periods. 
Development Product: Severe Knee Osteoarthritis Implant 
 We have developed an implant for the treatment of pain associated with severe knee OA in collaboration with HSS pursuant to an Investigatory-Initiated Research Agreement. This implant is being studied in an investigator-sponsored pilot study. The implant is composed of a specially manufactured surgical screw containing a Durasert system that delivers dexamethasone directly to the joint on a sustained basis. Dexamethasone is an off-patent corticosteroid that is frequently used for the treatment of OA. Implanted in the non-articulating area of the knee in an outpatient procedure, the implant is designed to provide long-term pain relief and thereby delay the need for knee replacement surgery. This implant represents the first use of our Durasert technology outside of ophthalmology. We believe this design, if successful, could be adapted for severe OA in other large joints. We are working with HSS on formalizing a commercial agreement to further develop the implant. 
 Knee OA is a degenerative joint disease that results from the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, with joint pain and stiffness the most common symptoms. More than 10 million people have knee OA. No cure exists, but pain and movement restriction associated with the disease are currently treated with oral analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids taken orally or injected into the knee, or hyaluronic acid injected into the knee. With degeneration, damage and pain from knee OA can become severe, making it the leading cause of total knee replacement surgery. More than 600,000 of these surgeries were performed last year in the U.S. alone, and the number is expected to grow. 
 Development Product: TKI Insert for Wet AMD 
 We are investigating the development of an injectable, bioerodible, sustained-release Durasert insert delivering a TKI for treatment of wet AMD. AMD, the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65, is most commonly treated with intravitreal injections of biologics that block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). FDA-approved Lucentis® and Eylea® and off-label use of anti-cancer drug Avastin® are the leading treatments for wet AMD. These biologics must be injected into the eye as frequently as monthly and typically can lose efficacy over time, resulting in vision loss and return of the disease. 
 In cancer therapy, TKIs are taken orally, but their toxicity prevents their systemic use to treat AMD. Using our Durasert technology, we plan to develop an implant to deliver a TKI directly to the back of the eye with a total dose that is significantly lower than is used in a course of cancer therapy. 
 Our development goal is to provide sustained treatment of wet AMD for six months with a single injection of a TKI-based product, targeting VEGF while avoiding the toxic systemic side effects of TKIs and the frequent injections of current wet AMD anti-VEGF biologics. Using a model TKI (that is not patentable), we have generated pre-clinical data that demonstrate that a TKI delivered by a sustained release insert was comparably efficacious to a commercially available biologic indicated for wet AMD delivered by injection, both in preventing choroidal neovascularization and in reducing vascular leakage. On the basis of these data, we are currently evaluating other, potentially patentable TKIs for sustained release over several months and with comparable therapeutic effects.

Feasibility Study Agreements 
 From time to time, we have entered into feasibility study agreements funded by third parties to evaluate our Durasert technology system for the treatment of ophthalmic and other diseases. We presently are engaged in one such agreement for a back of the eye disease. We intend to continue to identify other companies with compounds that could be successfully delivered with our Durasert technology and, through appropriate agreements, to generate non-dilutive operating capital for pSivida, subsequent licensing arrangements, clinical development and future royalties, should any such product candidate gain regulatory approval and achieve commercialization. 
Strategic Collaborations 
 We have entered into a number of collaboration/license agreements to develop and commercialize our product candidates and technologies. In all of these collaboration agreements, we have retained the right to use and develop the underlying technologies outside of the scope of the exclusive licenses granted. 
Alimera 
 In February 2005, as amended and restated in March 2008, we granted Alimera an exclusive worldwide license to manufacture, develop, market and sell ILUVIEN for the treatment and prevention of human eye diseases other than uveitis pursuant to the Prior Alimera Agreement. We also granted Alimera a worldwide non-exclusive license to manufacture, develop, market and sell certain additional Durasert-based products (1) to deliver a corticosteroid and no other active ingredient by a direct delivery method to the back of the eye solely for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans other than uveitis and (2) to treat DME in humans by delivering a compound by a direct delivery method through an incision no smaller than that required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. The non-exclusive license is limited to those products that, among other things, (i) have a drug core within a polymer layer (with certain limitations regarding chemically bonded combinations of active agents) and (ii) are approved, or designed to be approved, to deliver a corticosteroid and no other active ingredient by a direct delivery to the posterior portion of the eye, or to treat DME by delivering a compound by a direct delivery through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. We are not permitted to use, or grant a license to any third party to use, the licensed technologies to make or sell any products that are or would be subject to the non-exclusive license granted to Alimera. 
 In October 2014, Alimera paid us a $25.0 million milestone upon FDA approval of ILUVIEN as provided in the Prior Alimera Agreement. 
 In July 2017, we entered into the Amended Alimera Agreement to (i) license our Durasert three-year uveitis product candidate to Alimera for the EMEA under the ILUVIEN tradename and (ii) convert the previous net profit share arrangement on a country-by-country basis to sales-based royalties for DME, uveitis and any other ILUVIEN indications that obtain regulatory approval in various jurisdictions in the future, provided that certain amounts of Alimeras previous ILUVIEN net commercialization losses can be offset against earned sales-based royalties (as described below). We are entitled to receive a 2% sales-based royalty within 60 days following the end of each calendar quarter commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2017 and through calendar year 2018. Commencing January 1, 2019 (or earlier under certain circumstances) the sales-based royalty will increase to 6% on aggregate calendar year net sales up to $75 million and 8% on any calendar year sales in excess of $75 million. Alimeras share of accumulated ILUVIEN commercialization losses under the original net profit share arrangement (as set forth in the Prior Alimera Agreement), is capped at $25 million. Under the Amended Alimera Agreement those recoverable losses be reduced as follows: (i) $10 million was cancelled in lieu of any upfront license fee on the effective date of the Amended Alimera Agreement; (ii) for calendar years 2019 and 2020, 50% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% of net sales will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments due from Alimera; (iii) on January 1, 2020 (or earlier under certain circumstances), another $5 million of the accumulated commercialization losses will be cancelled, provided, however, that such date of cancellation may be extended further under certain circumstances related to Alimeras regulatory approval process for 
 
11 
 
 ILUVIEN for posterior uveitis, with such extension, if any, subject to mutual agreement by the parties; and (iv) commencing in calendar year 2021, 20% of earned sales-based royalties in excess of 2% of net sales will be offset against the quarterly royalty payments due from Alimera until such time as the remaining balance of the original $25 million of commercialization losses has been recouped by Alimera. 
 Bausch & Lomb 
 Under a 2003 amended license agreement, Bausch & Lomb has a worldwide exclusive license to make and sell Retisert and other first generation products defined in the agreement in return for royalties based on sales. This agreement also covered Vitrasert prior to patent expiration. Bausch & Lomb can terminate its agreement with us without penalty at any time upon 90 days written notice. 
Pfizer 
 In June 2011, we entered into an Amended and Restated Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) (the Restated Pfizer Agreement) to focus solely on the development of a sustained-release bioerodible micro-insert injected into the subconjunctiva designed to deliver latanoprost for human ophthalmic disease or conditions other than uveitis (the Latanoprost Product). Pfizer made an upfront payment of $2.3 million and we agreed to provide Pfizer options under various circumstances for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize the Latanoprost Product. On October 25, 2016, we notified Pfizer that we had discontinued development of the Latanoprost Product, which provided Pfizer a 60-day option to acquire a worldwide license in return for a $10.0 million payment and potential sales-based royalties and development, regulatory and sales performance milestone payments. Pfizer did not exercise its option and the Restated Pfizer Agreement automatically terminated on December 26, 2016. Provided that we do not conduct any research and development of the Latanoprost Product through calendar 2017, we retain the right thereafter to develop and commercialize the Latanoprost Product on our own or with a partner. By letter agreement effective as of April 11, 2017, Pfizer officially waived that restriction. 
Enigma Therapeutics 
 Our December 2012 license agreement, amended and restated in March 2013, with Enigma Therapeutics Limited (Enigma) provides Enigma with an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for the development of BrachySil (now named OncoSil), a product candidate for the treatment of pancreatic and other cancers. We received an upfront fee of $100,000 and are entitled to an 8% sales-based royalty, 20% of sublicense consideration and milestones based on aggregate product sales. To date, Enigma has not received regulatory approval for OncoSil in any jurisdiction. Enigma is obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $100,000, creditable during each ensuing twelve-month period against reimbursable patent maintenance costs and sales-based royalties. Annual license maintenance fees of $100,000 were paid in respect of each calendar year from 2013 through 2016. Enigma has the right to terminate this license upon 60 days prior written notice. 
Research and Development 
 Our clinical and pre-clinical research programs primarily focus on ophthalmic applications of our technology platform. Our research and development expenses totaled $14.9 million in fiscal 2017, $14.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $12.1 million in fiscal 2015. Of these amounts, $13.0 million in fiscal 2017, $12.8 million in fiscal 2016 and $10.6 million in fiscal 2015 were incurred for costs of research and development personnel, clinical and pre-clinical studies, contract services, testing and laboratory facilities. The remaining expense of $1.9 million in fiscal 2017, $1.6 million in fiscal 2016 and $1.5 million in fiscal 2015 consisted of non-cash charges for amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and stock-based compensation expense specifically allocated to research and development personnel. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we consolidated all of our research and development operations in our facility in Watertown, Massachusetts. We closed our research facility in Malvern, U.K. and terminated the employment of all our employees in that location.

Intellectual Property 
 We own or license patents in the U.S. and other countries. Our patents generally cover the design, formulation, manufacturing methods and use of our sustained release therapeutics, devices and technologies. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Patent term extension may be available in various countries to compensate for a patent office delay or a regulatory delay in approval of the product. 
 The U.S. patent with which Retisert is marked expires in March 2019. The last expiring patent covering Retisert expires in April 2020. The latest expiring patent covering ILUVIEN and Durasert three-year uveitis expires in August 2027 in the U.S. and in October 2024 in the EU, although extensions have been obtained or applied for through May 2027 in various EU countries. 
 The following table provides general details relating to our owned and licensed patents (including both patents that have been issued and applications that have been accepted for issuance) and patent applications as of August 31, 2017:

Employees 
 We had 22 employees as of August 31, 2017. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently manufacture our product candidates for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. We purchase raw materials and components necessary to manufacture Durasert three-year uveitis and our other product candidates in the ordinary course of business, and they are available from multiple sources. The manufacture of each of Retisert and ILUVIEN is the responsibility of our licensees. If Durasert three-year uveitis is approved, we plan to commercially manufacture the product in our current Watertown, MA facility. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We currently have no significant marketing or sales staff, but members of our leadership team have extensive commercialization experience. We currently depend on collaborative partners to market our approved products. Should we file our Durasert three-year uveitis NDA with the FDA as planned in late December 2017 or early January 2018, we expect to invest in our sales and marketing infrastructure during calendar year 2018 in preparation for a potential U.S. product launch in the first half of calendar year 2019. Significant expenditures will be required for us to develop an independent sales and marketing organization. We intend to use an outsourced contract sales organization to promote Durasert three-year uveitis to our defined audience in the U.S., although to date we have not entered into any such agreements. 
Competition 
 The market for products treating back-of-the-eye diseases is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We face substantial competition for our products and product candidates. Pharmaceutical, drug delivery and biotechnology companies, as well as research 
 
13 
 
 organizations, governmental entities, universities, hospitals, other nonprofit organizations and individual scientists, have developed and are seeking to develop drugs, therapies and novel delivery methods to treat diseases targeted by our products and product candidates. Most of our competitors and potential competitors are larger, better established, more experienced and have substantially more resources than we or our partners have. Competitors may reach the market earlier, may have obtained or could obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our products and potential products, and may offer products with greater efficacy, lesser or fewer side effects and/or other competitive advantages. We believe that competition for treatments of back-of-the-eye diseases is based upon the effectiveness of the treatment, side effects, time to market, reimbursement and price, reliability, ease of administration, dosing or injection frequency, patent position and other factors. 
 Many companies have or are pursuing products to treat back-of-the-eye diseases that are or would be competitive with ILUVIEN for DME or Durasert three-year uveitis. Some of these products and potential products include the following: 
 

 | DME. Genentech USA Inc.s Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals EYLEA (aflibercept) are approved in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of DME. Roches lower-cost Avastin is approved to treat various cancers, but is used off-label for treatment of diabetic retinopathy. These products are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors which are considered first line therapy for DME due to their ability to block the VEGF protein, which at high levels can cause abnormal blood vessels to grow in the eye and leak fluid. Genentech is a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group. Novartis AG has the right to market and sell Lucentis outside of the U.S. Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA in the U.S., and Bayer HealthCare owns the exclusive marketing rights outside the U.S. Lucentis, EYLEA and Avastin are all injected into the back of the eye on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Allergan, Inc.s Ozurdex® (dexamethasone intravitreal implant), a bioerodible intravitreal implant, has been approved for the treatment of DME, retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and posterior segment uveitis, and has a therapeutic duration of several months. As with ILUVIEN, Ozurdex delivers a corticosteroid (dexamethasone) to the back of the eye through an intravitreal injection. However, it only lasts for up to several months, resulting in frequent injections compared to ILUVIEN lasting for up to three years. Other companies, including Genentech, are working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery system for the potential treatment of DME, including those that act by blocking VEGF and VEGF receptors.

 | Posterior Segment Uveitis. Periocular steroid injections and systemic delivery of corticosteroids are routinely used to treat posterior segment uveitis, which is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the eye. It is treated both aggressively and frequently by physicians in order to minimize the disease flares, which are the main cause of vision deterioration and potential blindness. Ozurdex is approved in the U.S. and EU for posterior segment uveitis through an intravitreal bioerodible implant that provides treatment which lasts for several months. As with DME, the several month effectiveness of Ozurdex can result in frequent intravitreal injections of the implant. AbbVie recently obtained FDA approval for Humira® (adalimumab) for the treatment of all types of non-infectious uveitis (intermediate, posterior and panuveitis) and it is administered subcutaneously every other week for systemic delivery. Humira is a biologic that blocks tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Humiras retail price in the U.S. is approximately $50,000 per year. Other companies have ongoing trials of posterior segment uveitis treatments, including Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., which has recently filed an NDA for sirolimus, which is administered through intravitreal injection every two months. Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor and modulator of the immune system, and is being developed for non-infectious uveitis of the posterior segment. Clearsides CLS-TA (triamcinolone acetonide, a steroid) for macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis is in Phase II trials and it is administered through a suprachoroidal injection administered every two months. Preliminary clinical data indicate that the suprachoroidal route may reduce the risk of increased intraocular pressure that is typically associated with intraocular injection of steroids.

Government Regulation 
 We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, and FDAs implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record-keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we currently out-license certain of our products and may seek approval for, and market, other products in other countries in the future. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the EU are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the European Commission but country specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful. 
Development and Approval 
 Under the FD&C Act, FDA approval of an NDA is required before any new drug can be marketed in the United States. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant. 
 Pre-clinical Testing. Before testing any compound in human patients in the United States, a company must generate extensive pre-clinical data. Pre-clinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Certain animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agricultures Animal Welfare Act. 
 IND Application. Human clinical trials in the United States cannot commence until an investigational new drug, or IND, application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit pre-clinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop a clinical trial by placing it on clinical hold because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons. 
 
15 
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDAs bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with, as applicable, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study patients, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events, or AEs. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data. 
 A study sponsor is required to publicly post specified details about certain clinical trials and clinical trial results on government or independent websites (e.g., http://clinicaltrials.gov). Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another: 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human patients, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop initial data regarding the products effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential AEs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drugs overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. 
 NDA Submission and Review. The FD&C Act provides two pathways for the approval of new drugs through an NDA. An NDA under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act is a comprehensive application to support approval of a product candidate that includes, among other things, data and information to demonstrate that the proposed drug is safe and effective for its proposed uses, that production methods are adequate to ensure its identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug, and that proposed labeling is appropriate and contains all necessary information. A 505(b)(1) NDA contains results of the full set of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant to characterize and evaluate the product candidate. 
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act provides an alternate regulatory pathway to obtain FDA approval for new formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the 
 
16 
 
 filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely to some extent upon the FDAs findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the reference listed drug, or RLD, and submit its own product-specific data  which may include data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the applicant  to address differences between the product candidate and the RLD. 
 The submission of an NDA under either Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) generally requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality, and purity. For some NDAs, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to seek insights and recommendations on issues relevant to approval of the application. Although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, the agency usually has followed such recommendations. 
 The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must also include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
 Once an NDA submission has been accepted for filingwhich occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDAthe FDAs goal for a non-priority review of an NDA is ten months. The review process can be and often is significantly extended, however, by FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. After review of an NDA, the FDA may decide to not approve the application or may issue a complete response letter, or CRL, outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The CRL also may request additional information, including additional pre-clinical or clinical data. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. 
 Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additionally, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug or require post-approval commitments, including the completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as Phase 4 or post-marketing studies. 
 Post-approval modifications to the drug, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval. 
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 Once approved, products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials if there are new safety information developments. 
 
17 
 
Good Manufacturing Practices. Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, and processes used in manufacturing pharmaceutical products prior to approval. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the FDA compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements. 
 Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, advertising and promotion to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for off-label usesthat is, uses not approved by the FDA and not described in the products labelingbecause the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced, scientific communication regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes a drug. 
 Other Requirements. NDA holders must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. 
 Hatch-Waxman Act 
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for pharmaceutical products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved products. 
 Generic Drugs. A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (i) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed products safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective. 
 505(b)(2) NDAs. As discussed above, if a product is similar, but not identical, to an already approved product, it may be submitted for approval via an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Unlike an 
 
18 
 
 ANDA, this does not excuse the sponsor from demonstrating the proposed products safety and effectiveness. Rather, the sponsor is permitted to rely to some degree on the FDAs finding that the RLD is safe and effective, and must submit its own product-specific data of safety and effectiveness to an extent necessary because of the differences between the products. An NDA approved under 505(b)(2) may in turn serve as an RLD for subsequent applications from other sponsors. 
 RLD Patents. In an NDA, a sponsor must identify patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or a method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. The sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking to rely on an approved product as the RLD must make one of several certifications regarding each listed patent. A Paragraph III certification is the sponsors statement that it will wait for the patent to expire before obtaining approval for its product. A Paragraph IV certification is an assertion that the patent does not block approval of the later product, either because the patent is invalid or unenforceable or because the patent, even if valid, is not infringed by the new product. 
 Regulatory Exclusivities. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as RLDs for an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a new chemical entity, or NCEgenerally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drugthere is a period of five years from the products approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor of the application makes a Paragraph IV certification. 
 A product that is not an NCE may qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains new clinical data, derived from studies conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. 
 Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted, and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicants assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the 30-month stay does not begin until five years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. 
 Patent Term Restoration. A portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA is restored if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration.

European and Other International Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the national health authority of each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA. In the EU, marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or the national procedure of an individual EU Member State. In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA. The agency will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization that permits the marketing of a product in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, StatesIceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases. This route is optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health. 
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application process is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure is similarly based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State. 
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
20 
 
Accelerated Review 
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest. Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
Compliance 
 During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Third country authorities can impose equivalent penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Other Exclusivities 
 Pediatric Exclusivity. Section 505A of the FD&C Act provides for six months of additional exclusivity or patent protection if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data does not need to show that the product is effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDAs request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. When any product is approved, we will evaluate seeking pediatric exclusivity as appropriate. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees. A drug that is approved for the orphan drug designated indication generally is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. 
 In the European Union, the EMAs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, orphan drug designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, with a 
 
21 
 
 limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity 
 Data Exclusivity. In the European Union if a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.
U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the donut hole), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Services 340B drug pricing discount program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse, and enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. 
 Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with an income of up to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the Affordable Care Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval, business and financial condition. Where new patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new Medicaid options made available through the Affordable Care Act, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, the federal government has announced delays in the implementation of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act. 
 Moreover, legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. The American Health Care Act of 2017, or AHCA, which would repeal and replace key portions of the Affordable Care Act, was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but remains subject to passage by the U.S. Senate. In addition, in January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or replaced in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future 
 
22 
 
 could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payors, such as commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors determine which drugs they will cover and the amount of reimbursement they will provide for a covered drug. In the U.S., there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for our products, if approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costly studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if we conduct pharmacoeconomic studies, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by payors. Further, a payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. 
 In the past, payors have implemented reimbursement metrics and periodically revised those metrics as well as the methodologies used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, or ASP, average manufacturer price, or AMP, and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, surveys and publishes retail pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC files, to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. 
 Participation in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program would require us to pay a rebate for each unit of drug reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the basic portion of the rebate for each product is set by law as the larger of: (i) 23.1% of quarterly AMP, or (ii) the difference between quarterly AMP and the quarterly best price available from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer, or Best Price. AMP must be reported on a monthly and quarterly basis and Best Price is reported on a quarterly basis only. In addition, the rebate also includes the additional portion, which adjusts the overall rebate amount upward as an inflation penalty when the drugs latest quarters AMP exceeds the drugs AMP from the first full quarter of sales after launch, adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index-Urban. The upward adjustment in the rebate amount per unit is equal to the excess amount of the current AMP over the inflation-adjusted AMP from the first full quarter of sales. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our report to CMS of current quarterly AMP and Best Price for our drug. The terms of our participation in the program would impose a requirement for us to report revisions to AMP or Best Price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. 
 Federal law requires that any manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturers drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge 
 
23 
 
 statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B ceiling price for the manufacturers covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any changes to the definition of AMP and the Medicaid rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act or other legislation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations. 
 In the U.S. Medicare program, outpatient prescription drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans provided for under Medicare Part C. 
 Coverage and reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs under Part D are not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Although Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, they have some flexibility to establish those categories and classes and are not required to cover all of the drugs in each category or class. Medicare Part D prescription drug plans may use formularies to limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and/or impose differential cost sharing or other utilization management techniques. 
 The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, in order for the products that we market to be included on the formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we likely will have to offer pricing that is lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Changes to Medicare Part D that give plans more freedom to limit coverage or manage utilization, and other cost reduction initiatives in the program, could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. 
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we expect to participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under this program, we would be obligated to make our innovator drugs available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agenciesthe VA, U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guardthat is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also expect to participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we would pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP. 
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government or fails to submit the required price data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate the manufacturers Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for the manufacturers covered outpatient drugs. In addition, claims submitted to federally-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for drugs priced based on incorrect pricing data provided by a manufacturer can implicate the federal Civil False Claims Act.

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. If Congress does not take action in the future to modify these sequestrations, Medicare Part D plans could seek to reduce their negotiated prices for drugs. Other legislative or regulatory cost containment legislation could have a similar effect. 
 Further, the Affordable Care Act may reduce the profitability of drug products. It expanded manufacturers rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well, increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. 
 The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $4.0 billion in 2017, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Services 340B program to include additional types of covered entities. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. It appears likely that the Affordable Care Act will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
 Legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration, as discussed above under the heading U.S. Healthcare Reform. In addition, there likely will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to contain healthcare costs. Thus, even if we obtain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for any products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, each EU Member States can restrict the range of medicinal products for which its national health insurance system provides reimbursement and can control the prices of medicinal products for human use marketed on its territory. As a result, following receipt of marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with the competent pricing authority in the individual EU Member State. The governments of the EU Member States influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some EU Member States operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently 
 
25 
 
 available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Others adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territories either on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Further, some EU Member States approve a specific price for the medicinal product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, we may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products, however, is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These EU Member States include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. 
 The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between EU Member States. 
 In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients rights in cross-border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU Member States. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, our business will be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, particularly once third-party reimbursement becomes available for one or more of our products. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims statutes. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. The Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or 
 
26 
 
 recommend pharmaceuticals, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, speakers or advisors, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. Arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute and do not fit within an exception or safe harbor are reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, based on the facts and circumstances, they violate the statute. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the federal civil False Claims Act may be brought by private individuals known as qui tam relators in the name of the government. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal civil False Claims Act for, among other things, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, inflating prices reported to private price publication services which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs, and other interactions with prescribers and other customers including interactions that may have affected customers billing or coding practices on claims submitted to the federal government. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companys marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA, also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, several states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. 
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Childrens Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the previous calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Compliance with such laws and regulations will require substantial resources. Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to 
 
27 
 
 challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other settlement to resolve allegations of violations of these laws, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity. 
 Healthcare Privacy Laws 
 We may be subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. In addition, healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity.
