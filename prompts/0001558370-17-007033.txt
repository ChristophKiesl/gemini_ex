 Our technical and engineering capabilities enable us to design and manufacture a broad range of power plant and other industrial equipment to meet each customer’s specific performance requirements. We provide the following comprehensive range of solutions critical to the operation of power plants.

· | Inlet Systems. Inlet systems are comprised of filter houses and air intake ducts that condition the air entering a turbine or engine (pulse-type or barrier filtration, temperature and moisture control, flow distribution and pressure drop optimization) and provide acoustical treatment for noise generated by the gas turbine air flow. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exhaust Systems. Exhaust systems, including diffusers, plenums, ducts and stacks, expansion joints and diverter dampers, direct the hot exhaust from the turbine to the atmosphere in the case of simple cycle operation or into a heat recovery steam generator (“HRSG”) when the power plant is operated as a combined cycle facility. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems. SCR systems are used in simple cycle gas turbine facilities and are focused on removing oxides of nitrogen and carbon and other volatiles from exhaust gas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Custom-Engineered Equipment Skids. Custom-engineered, pre-packaged equipment skids, either enclosed or open to the elements, with or without HVAC, can be used for a wide variety of industrial equipment applications, allowing faster and lower cost equipment installation at a customer’s industrial site. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The contracts under which we sell our products are typically fixed-price contracts, most of which are “lump sum bid” contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we bid against other suppliers based on customer or project specifications. Many of our project destinations are outside the U.S.
 Historically, Mechanical Solutions fabricated equipment through a combination of in-house manufacturing at our own facilities in the U.S. and Mexico and outsourced manufacturing in other countries around the world. However, beginning in 2016, all of our Mechanical Solutions businesses, except CFI, began exclusively using outsourced manufacturing facilities. Our network of high quality manufacturing partners, located in more than 20 countries, allows us to manufacture equipment worldwide and maintain a competitive cost structure. Outsourcing our gas turbine auxiliary product manufacturing enables us to meet increasing demand without internal manufacturing capacity limitations, to reduce our capital expenditure requirements and to respond to the particular sourcing initiatives of our customers, whether those initiatives call for global sourcing or for localized supply content. Our employees work closely with our international manufacturing partners to supervise the fabrication of our products at their facilities to ensure high levels of quality and workmanship. While we generally have proven, long-term relationships with our subcontractors, we also routinely search for additional subcontractors to enhance our ability to manufacture equipment at the lowest cost while maintaining high quality standards and on time delivery.
 We maintain agreements with key third party fabricators, many of which require OEM approval. We conduct regular quality audits of our fabricators and, in some cases, maintain staff on-site. Subcontractors can sometimes take several years to qualify to meet our requirements and international standards, including OEM audit and approval.
 Electrical Solutions
 As of December 31, 2016, this reportable segment was comprised of Koontz-Wagner, the former operations of IBI Power following its merger with and into Koontz-Wagner and the portion of the Energy Packaged Power Solutions business that we acquired in the first quarter of 2015 from Siemens Industry, Inc. (“Siemens” and the “Siemens’ eHouse manufacturing operations”). Electrical Solutions focuses on custom engineering and manufacturing of integrated control house systems, engine generator packages and enclosures, industrial tanks and custom-engineered equipment skids for the energy, oil and gas, digital data storage and electrical industries. Our principal customers are turbine and reciprocating engine OEMs, switchgear and drive OEMs, backup and distributed power providers, EPC firms, electric utilities and owner/operators of independent electric power facilities, oil and gas midstream and downstream operations, information technology companies and other industrial companies. Our solutions are custom-engineered to meet customer-specific requirements.

 Electrical Solutions continues to leverage its geographically broad North American manufacturing footprint to provide control houses, custom-engineered equipment skids and generator packages throughout the western hemisphere.
 Services
 As of December 31, 2016, this reportable segment was comprised of Williams Industrial Services Group, LLC (collectively with Williams Plant Services, LLC, Williams Specialty Services, LLC and Williams Industrial Services, LLC, the “Williams business”) and Hetsco. The Hetsco business was sold in January 2017. See “Explanatory Note” for additional information. Our Services segment provides a comprehensive range of maintenance, modification and construction support services for nuclear power plants and a wide range of utility and industrial customers in the fossil fuel, industrial gas, natural gas and petrochemical industries, as well as other industrial operations. We provide these services primarily on a direct hire basis, where we manage and perform the work ourselves. We can also act in a general contracting capacity where we manage multiple subcontractors and, in other cases, we are retained as a subcontractor on a project. We primarily operate in the U.S. The Hetsco business generated a portion of its revenue in 2016 from offshore repairs of installed aluminum heat exchangers, primarily in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The services provided by our Services segment are designed to improve or sustain operating efficiencies and extend the useful lives of process equipment. We provide these services both on a constant presence basis and for discrete projects.

Our flexible staffing and equipment model enables us to meet seasonal and outage demand without being restricted by internal capacity limitations, thereby minimizing our fixed costs.
 In 2016, our Services segment contracted for 72% of the services it provided on a cost-plus basis under contracts that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. It contracted for 28% of the services it provided on a fixed-price basis.
 We bid against other contractors based on customer specifications. Fixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Alternatively, because of efficiencies that may be realized during the contract term, fixed-price contracts may offer greater profit potential than cost-plus contracts.
 For additional information about our segments, please refer to “Note 1—Business and Organization” and “Note 18—Segment Information” to our consolidated financial statements.
 Market Overview
 Gas Turbine Power Generation and Cogeneration Market.  All gas turbine power plants combine a gas turbine with a generator to produce electricity. In a simple cycle gas turbine plant, the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is vented to the atmosphere through an exhaust stack. In a combined cycle plant, the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is fed into a HRSG. The HRSG captures much of the heat from the gas turbine exhaust to generate steam, which in turn is used to power a steam turbine and generate more electricity before the exhaust is vented into the atmosphere. We manufacture products that are critical components of both simple cycle and combined cycle plants, including packaged control houses, cabinets and skids, or “balance of plant hardware,” filter houses, inlet and exhaust systems, SCRs and turbine and generator components. We also engineer and manufacture specialized diverter dampers that are used in some combined cycle plants between the gas turbine and the HRSG.
 Utility-scale natural gas turbine power plants are built to meet growth in demand for electricity, replace aged power producing facilities or supplant less environmentally-friendly coal-fired power plants. According to Enerdata, a global energy intelligence organization, world electricity consumption stabilized in 2014 and 2015 after declining from the global recession. Demand began to rebound in 2016, but was still below historic growth trends.
 We believe the driver for natural gas turbine facilities and related demand for our products and services are the advantages of natural gas turbine power generation plants versus other technologies, which include:

· | lower construction costs;
--+--------------------------


· | shorter construction periods;
--+------------------------------

· | flexibility to expand plant capacity;
--+--------------------------------------


· | smaller geographical footprint; and
--+------------------------------------


· | rapid start-up and shutdown time.
--+----------------------------------

  Oil and Gas Market.  The American Petroleum Institute defines the oil and gas industry as having three segments: Exploration and Production (“upstream”), Transportation (“midstream”) and Refining/Constituent Chemical Processing (“downstream”). We design, manufacture, integrate and package free standing metal interlocking panel buildings that house control systems, switch gear and generators. Our products are deployed globally into the upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas markets. We produce specialty engineered products, such as flow control and customized skids. Our focus on lean manufacturing processes enables us to perform rapid, serial production of systems and solutions for large projects. We also provide installation, facility upgrade, repair and maintenance services for midstream and downstream operations such as pipeline terminals, compressor or pumping stations and storage operations, refineries and petrochemical processing facilities and LNG operations.
 While the drivers for the three segments of the oil and gas industry can vary, we believe demand for certain of our products and services is driven by strength in the oil and gas production industry, which is subject to volatility in energy prices and demand.
 The North American oil and gas market has benefited in recent years from advanced extraction methods such as hydraulic fracturing, which has led to pipeline expansions as well as the development of petrochemical facilities and gas separation and liquefaction projects. However, the price of oil began to decline in mid-2014 and dropped to a 14-year low in January 2016. Oil prices began to rise from that point, and the West Texas Intermediate price has been fluctuating around $40 to $50 per barrel since April 2016. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reported as of July 25, 2017, that U.S. crude oil production is forecasted to average 9.3 million barrels per day for the year, up approximately 15% from 2016, and is expected to increase another 6.5% in 2018. Additionally, key members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced that they will continue the production cuts from the first half of 2017 into 2018. We believe these factors will continue to positively impact the U.S. oil production industry.
 Power Generation Market and the Industrial Services Industry. The U.S. industrial services industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, broadly defined as routine modification, maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants. The industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints, reduce labor costs, increase labor utilization and productivity and eliminate operational redundancies.
 We expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future:

· | Aging Power Generation Infrastructure Increases Demand for Plant Maintenance and Decommissioning Services. According to the EIA, more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the U.S. was placed in service before 1990. Coupled with the relatively limited number of large-scale power generation facilities being constructed in the U.S., the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and to take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites provide opportunities for companies providing services to plant operators. The low price of natural gas is driving demand for new and replacement generation capacity toward combined cycle gas powered plants, which are more economical to run. With natural gas pricing expected to remain low, this is also driving the conversions of simple cycle plants to combined cycle technology. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Further, approximately 90 nuclear reactors that have been in operation in the U.S. for more than 30 years require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. are subject to a rigorous program of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) oversight, inspection, preventive and corrective maintenance, equipment replacement and equipment testing. Nuclear power plants are required by the NRC to go offline to refuel at 

 
  9

 
intervals of no more than 24 months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance during every refueling outage. Initially, commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. were licensed to operate for 40 years, reflecting the amortization period generally used by electric utility companies for large capital investments. As of December 31, 2016, the NRC had extended the licenses of approximately 85 reactors. In all, about 90 reactors are expected to operate for up to 60 years, with owners undertaking an increase in modification, maintenance and construction capital projects to upgrade these facilities. Decommissioning work on retired nuclear reactors also provides future opportunities for growth.

· | International Natural Gas Turbine Power Generation Growth. Our Mechanical Solutions segment has had demand for its products from the Middle East, Mexico, South Korea and Southeast Asia. Large, or jumbo, natural gas turbine power generation units represent approximately two-thirds of the new capacity demand. Small natural gas turbine units have also been in demand for portable power and remote/island power needs. The overall number of projects in the Middle East is continuing to rise, including plant upgrades and conversion from simple cycle to combined cycle technology. Among the factors driving this increase for natural gas turbines is operational flexibility, short construction time and the improvement in combined cycle gas turbine technology that has been developed by the major OEMs, which exceeds 60% efficiency. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | North America Infrastructure Growth. Record levels of natural gas production has driven transmission and distribution infrastructure development to reduce transportation bottlenecks and bring more natural gas to key markets. The value of low cost shale gas is transitioning from upstream to downstream users, including petrochemical facilities and power generation assets. Infrastructure growth provides opportunities for our Services segment to assist in the construction and maintenance of these facilities, while our Electrical Solutions segment can provide its products to the engineering and procurement contractors designing and building the plants as well as to the owner/operators. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nuclear Power Plant Services and New Nuclear Reactor Construction. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services in U.S. nuclear power plants under rules issued by the NRC. We are one of the few contractors with a qualified and audited Nuclear Quality Assurance (“NQA-1”) Program, which is required to perform contract services at the new build reactors. Under these rules, owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with NRC regulations on quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. On the majority of our maintenance and project work, we directly hire the labor and provide the management and supervision to perform the work directly for the owner. In some cases, we act as a general contractor and subcontract portions of the work or, alternatively, subcontract our services to full scope EPC firms or general contractor firms. We maintain good relationships with the utilities, the EPC firms, the general contractor firms and relevant engineering firms. Revenue associated with construction-related projects and other comprehensive service provided at nuclear power plants totaled $125.6 million in 2016 and $255.6 million in 2015. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As of December 31, 2016, there were four new nuclear reactors at two U.S. sites in various stages of construction and commissioning: two at Plant Vogtle in Georgia and two at V.C. Summer in South Carolina. In 2015 and 2016, and continuing through August 2017, our Services segment has participated in several construction-related projects at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3. 
 Revenue associated with construction projects at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaled $20.0 million and $15.0 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. On August 30, 2017, the owners of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, along with the other co-owners, filed their recommendation with Georgia’s Public Service Commission to continue construction of Plant Vogtle’s nuclear expansion. Our Services segment has served as a subcontractor for nuclear expansion work at the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 since 2011, and based on this announcement, we believe we can continue to expand the scope of that work. We expect the final decision to be made by the Georgia Public Service Commission after it reviews the recommendations made by the co-owners. In the event construction is discontinued, our Services segment will be adversely affected. 
 Revenue associated with construction-related projects at V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 totaled $3.1 million and $1.7 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The owners of V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina seeking approval of an abandonment plan of such units, which they later voluntarily withdrew. The ultimate status of V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 is currently unclear. In the event the V.C. Summer units are abandoned, our Services segment will be adversely 

 
  10

 
affected, although the volume of our services provided at this site was not material to our business as a whole. 
 We also had a significant role in the recent completion of construction activities at Watts Bar Unit 2 in 2016. Revenue associated with construction-related projects at Watts Bar Unit 2 totaled $26.6 million in 2016 and $92.8 million in 2015. 

· | Industrial Gas and Natural Gas Markets. Industrial gases are used in a variety of end markets and frequently require aluminum-brazed heat exchangers to address cryogenic production capabilities. The global industrial gas market is projected to grow, driven by emerging markets and energy demand. In addition, natural gas demand is expected to grow, particularly from petrochemical manufacturers, LNG processors and other companies in the refining and industrial gas industries that use natural gas as a feedstock. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we sold our Hetsco business. Following that sale, our penetration into the industrial gas industry for the repair and maintenance of cryogenic gas production was eliminated. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Standby and Distributed Power Generation. Unlike central station generation, standby and distributed power generation equipment can sit on either side of the utility meter and may be owned by a utility, a customer or a third party. Peak energy demand requirements and higher costs, as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure limits, are driving investment into this space. The growth in industries with high power demand and sensitivity to power supply instability, such as datacenters, medical centers, universities and remotely located industrial loads, are straining the traditional power infrastructure. The electric power needs for these markets have been served by small-scale utility-owned diesel or gas engine generators strategically located to support distributed system operations. The power supply is trending toward larger (greater than 1,000 Kilowatts) diesel engine generator systems and expanding into alternative energy assets. Our Electrical Services segment serves the large and growing datacenter industry with customized generator enclosures and fuel tanks. Our experience in this industry enables us to extend our offerings into adjacent markets through the relationships developed with engine OEMs.

  Business Strategy
 Beginning in 2015 and continuing in 2017, we initiated a strategy to sell assets, aggressively manage working capital and reduce costs in order to improve liquidity and reduce debt. Currently, we are evaluating strategic alternatives for our Mechanical Solutions segment as we believe this segment’s customers, employees and suppliers could benefit from increased capital and increased investments to allow the segment to compete more effectively and pursue greater growth. Our strategy is also to leverage the strength of our brands (Braden, Consolidated Fabricators, Koontz-Wagner and Williams), capitalize on our industry knowledge and customer relationships and safely provide reliable service and high quality products on time for our customers. As part of our annual planning process, each of our businesses develops growth, productivity improvement and cost reduction initiatives. Each unit has specific initiatives with associated targets for revenue and cash flow. To achieve these goals, our domestic Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions businesses must improve their operational performance, drive operational excellence, improve customer and supplier relationships and expand their customer base. Our Services business must increase the number of customers it serves, increase the number of services it offers and leverage its capabilities across more industries.
 We pursue revenue and margin enhancement opportunities, including streamlining and consolidating operations, utilizing estimating and engineering technologies, deploying rigorous project management techniques, initiating various process improvement projects and employing experienced industry-recognized sales professionals.
 We are also focused on increasing our margins through the application of lean manufacturing processes and continuous improvement in our operations. We are committed to delivering quality products and services on time for our customers. In addition to pursuing better execution on the shop floor and at our project sites, we have streamlined our selling and administrative functions to better serve our customers. We have implemented lean manufacturing processes to be closer to our customers and adjust faster to changing market conditions.
 While headcount continues to decline, positions that have been replaced have been upgraded to expand our range of expertise and depth of knowledge. Our objective is to foster a workplace that will attract top people, challenge them with meaningful projects, reward them for their performance and advance their careers.

 Materials and Suppliers
 The majority of materials we purchase are for our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments. The principal materials for our products are carbon steel plate, sheet steel, stainless steel products and other structural shapes, wire, cable and insulation. We obtain these materials from a number of U.S. and international suppliers. The markets for most of the materials we use are served by a large number of suppliers, and we believe that we can obtain required materials from more than one supplier. During 2016 and continuing into 2017, our relationships with certain suppliers to our domestic Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments have been negatively impacted as we have delayed payments beyond contractual due dates due to liquidity constraints.

 Competition
 Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions.  We compete with a number of domestic and international companies. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have significantly greater financial resources. Other competitors are small, typically privately held companies that are often less sensitive to project risk and onerous contract terms. The competitive landscape is defined not only by the specific product offering, but also by the geographic delivery footprint, total delivery cycle time (from order to title transfer), reputation, build quality, ability to design products to meet each customer’s unique specifications (including design elements and manufacturing methods impacting the total cost of ownership, designed ease of site installation and landed equipment footprint), and total project price. A project’s competitiveness can be influenced by any one or a number of these conditions.
 Services.  Our competitors vary depending on plant geography and the scope of services to be rendered. Several national service providers, which are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do, will often compete for larger maintenance and capital project opportunities that become available. These service providers include, among others, Day & Zimmermann and Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Additionally, smaller contractors that operate on a regional basis often compete for smaller opportunities associated with open shop labor sources. We believe that the key competitive factors in the services we offer are reputation, safety, price, service, quality, breadth of service capabilities and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel. We believe our project management capabilities, including service diversity, long-term customer relationships, safety record and performance, differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe that the fact that we maintain a presence at several of our customers’ sites is a competitive advantage because it provides us with an intimate understanding of these facilities, which allows us to better identify our customers’ service needs. Specific to our customers that operate nuclear power plants, the barriers to entry include the requirement of NRC qualifications and safety standards.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 877 full- and part-time employees (excluding temporary staff and craft labor in our Services segment). The number of employees in our Services segment fluctuates greatly, depending on the timing and requirements for craft labor. Many of the craft labor employees for our Services segment are contracted through various union agreements. As of December 31, 2016, there were 732 craft labor employees for our Services segment, of which 443 were under collective bargaining agreements. At our Koontz-Wagner business, there are 44 employees who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationships with our employees, both full-time and temporary, are satisfactory. We are not aware of any circumstances related to our employees that are likely to result in a work stoppage at any of our facilities. In January 2017, we sold our Hetsco business, which resulted in a decrease in the number of our employees.  Insurance
 We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations; however, we remain exposed to potential losses because we are subject to deductibles, coverage limits and self-insured retentions.
 Typically, our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for third party injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects.
 We maintain performance and payment bonding lines to support our business. As of December 31, 2016, we maintained a revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that provided letters of credit. In June 2017, Centre Lane acquired the debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We subsequently entered into the Centre Lane Facility and repaid the full balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We require certain of our subcontractors to indemnify us and our customers and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of such subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure such subcontractors’ work or as required by contract. It is possible that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will not fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers.

 Intellectual Property
 We use a variety of trademarks, proprietary technologies and other intellectual property in the ordinary course of business in our segments. We rely upon our pending and issued patents, registered and unregistered trademark rights, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, subcontractors, customers and others and various other security measures to protect our intellectual property. Several patents related to exhaust systems will expire in 2017, a patent related to a filter element clip will expire in 2027, patents for an acoustic module enclosure door and an exhaust plenum for gas turbine will expire in 2032, a patent for an exhaust plenum for gas turbines will expire in 2033, and a patent for a method and apparatus for corrugating filter media will expire in 2034. We have patent applications pending for other products. We do not believe that any single patent or proprietary technology is material to our business, and we do not believe that our competitive position would be materially affected by competitors also using similar technologies and systems. Compliance with Government Regulations
 We are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory, export and product safety laws applicable in the countries in which we operate. We also purchase materials and equipment from third parties and engage subcontractors who are also subject to these laws and regulations. Below is a summary of certain laws and regulations applicable to our business.
· | Environmental. We are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions where we do business. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or hazardous materials. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Health and Safety Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state and international laws. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors who perform construction services, including electrical and repair and maintenance, to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted very strict and comprehensive safety regulations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NRC. Owners of nuclear power plants are licensed to build, operate and maintain those plants by the NRC. Their license requires that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with NRC regulations. Our Services segment must demonstrate to its customers that we will comply with NRC regulations related to quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other Regulatory Matters. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the U.S., we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports. These include, but are not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Department of the Treasury. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  While we believe that we operate safely and prudently and in material compliance with all environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory, export and product safety laws, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our business. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures or material adverse effect on earnings or cash flows as a result of complying with these laws.

 Global Power was incorporated in 2001 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became the successor to GEEG Holdings, LLC, which was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998. We and all of our U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on September 28, 2006 and successfully emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to an approved Plan of Reorganization on January 22, 2008. Upon emergence, we issued 5,266,885 shares of our new common stock to pre-petition equity holders in exchange for stock held before the bankruptcy. On that same date, pursuant to a rights offering, a private placement and related backstop and our Management Incentive Co-Investment Plan, we issued an additional 9,589,138 shares of our new common stock in exchange for $72.5 million in net proceeds. The applicable price of our common stock in the rights offering was $7.65 per share. As part of the plan, we also entered into a $150.0 million credit facility, which was terminated in 2012 in connection with our entry into the Revolving Credit Facility. In June 2011, we received a court order for final decree closing the Chapter 11 Filing. Available Information
