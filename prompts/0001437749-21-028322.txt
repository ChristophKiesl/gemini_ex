ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
Lee Enterprises, Incorporated was founded in 1890, incorporated in 1950 and serves 77 mid-sized local communities (including TNI Partners ("TNI") and Madison Newspapers, Inc. ("MNI") in 26 states) as the leading provider of valuable, intensely local, original news and information through our traditional print and digital subscriptions, and innovative, digitally focused marketing solutions to local advertisers. On March 16, 2020, we completed the acquisition of BH Media Group, Inc. ("BH Media") and The Buffalo News, Inc. ("Buffalo News"), adding 31 local media operations and nearly doubling our audience size and total operating revenue.
 
Our asset portfolio includes digital subscription platforms, daily, weekly and monthly newspapers and niche publications, all delivering original local news and information. Our products offer print and digital editions, and our content and advertising is available in real time through our websites and mobile apps. We operate in predominately mid-sized communities with products ranging from large daily newspapers and associated digital products, such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The Buffalo News, to non-daily newspapers with news websites and digital platforms serving smaller communities.
 
As the leading provider of local news and information in our local markets and an innovative marketing solutions company, we aim to grow our business through three main categories: subscriptions to our product offerings, advertising and marketing solutions to local advertisers, and digital services to a diverse set of customers. The execution of this strategy is expected to enable the Company to continue its transformation from a more traditional print media business to a digitally focused subscription platform and digital marketing solutions company.
 

• | Our digital subscription platforms are some of the fastest growing digital subscription platforms in local media. At the end of 2021, we had more than 400,000 subscribers to our digital platforms, up 65% over 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our digital marketing services agency, Amplified Agency ("Amplified") offers a full suite of digital marketing solutions to local advertisers both in and outside of the markets in which we operate a subscription platform. Revenue at Amplified totaled almost $42 million in 2021, up 43% over 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our software as a service (SaaS) content platform, TownNews, is one of the largest web-hosting and content management SaaS providers in North America. TownNews represents a powerful opportunity to drive additional digital revenue by providing state-of-the-art web hosting and content management services to more than 2,000 customers who rely on TownNews for their web, over-the-top display ("OTT"), mobile, video and social media products. Revenue at TownNews, including intercompany revenue, totaled more than $27 million in 2021, and has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 10.5% over the last ten years. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We generate revenue primarily through advertising and marketing services, subscriptions to our digital and print products, and digital services, primarily through our majority owned subsidiary, TownNews. Our operations also provide printing and distribution of third party publications.
 
Advertising and Marketing Services - In 2021, advertising and marketing services of $369.3 million comprised 46% of total operating revenue, down from 47% in the prior year.
 

• | Local advertising revenue is earned from top local accounts and small to medium businesses (SMBs) in but not limited to our markets. Advertising takes the form of display advertising in daily and non-daily publications, preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, display advertising delivered on our owned and operated websites, and a full suite of digital marketing services through Amplified, including targeted display, video, OTT, custom content, web development, social media management, search, email marketing and other tactics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National advertising is revenue earned from the sale of print or digital display advertising space, or from preprint advertising inserted in the publication, from national accounts that do not have a local retailer representing the account in the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our primary strategy is a data-driven, multi-channel sales approach that enables our sales force to put the right marketing solution that maximizes audience reach for our advertisers by tailoring advertising and marketing solutions based on the size, scale, and needs of the advertiser. Through Amplified we create sophisticated digital campaigns on our owned and operated sites and on third-party sites that give advertisers the ability to target their message. We collaborate with Google and other ad tech companies to provide key metrics and analytics to measure campaign effectiveness. 
 
Our advertising revenues are subject to seasonality due primarily to fluctuations in advertising spend. Advertising revenue is typically highest in our first quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the second quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.

Subscription Revenue - In 2021, subscription revenue of $357.7 million comprised 45% of our total operating revenue, up from 43% in the prior year. Subscription revenue is earned primarily from our full access subscription model, whereby subscribers receive complete access to our content on all platforms, both print and digital, and from subscriptions to our digital-only products. We also generate revenue from the sale of single copy editions.
 

• | Our printed newspapers reach almost 1 million households daily and more than 1.2 million on Sunday, and more than 265,000 users access our digital e-edition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our web and mobile sites are the number one digital source of local news in most of our markets, reaching more than 50 million unique visitors, at the end of September 2021, with almost 1 million "known-users".
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of September 26, 2021, we have 402,000 digital-only subscribers, a 65% increase over 2020. Growing our digital only subscribers remains a key strategic priority as we make the digital transformation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Digital Services Revenue – In 2021, digital services revenue of $19 million comprised 2.4% of our total operating revenue, compared to 3% in the prior year. Almost all of our digital services revenue is from TownNews. TownNews, operated through our 82.5% owned subsidiary INN Partners, L.C. and is one of the largest web-hosting and content management SaaS providers in North America and offers state of the art integrated digital publishing and content management solutions for creating, distributing, and monetizing multimedia content. 
 

• | TownNews is the engine that powers our digital products. In addition, TownNews services nearly 2,000 daily customers, including legacy media publications, universities, television stations and niche publications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Including intercompany revenue generated from our markets, revenue at TownNews grew almost 9% in 2021 and totaled $27 million.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | With strong product offerings, investments in video and streaming technology and diversifying the customer base into broadcast, TownNews is positioned to continue to be a key component to our growth strategy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Other Revenue - In 2021, Other Revenue of $67.7 million comprised 8.5% of total operating revenue, down from 9.7% the prior year. Excluding digital services revenue, other revenue is comprised mainly of commercial printing and delivery of third party products and until March 16, 2020 revenue from our Management Agreement with BH Media. In 2021, other revenue excluding digital services of $19 million, comprised 6.1% of our total operating revenue, down from 6.8% in the prior year.
 
We compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend as well as other news and information outlets for subscription spend. The market for local digital marketing solutions is highly competitive and evolving allowing opportunities for new competitors to enter the market. Amplified competes with other digital marketing solutions agencies as well as other media companies who have a similar strategy for digital marketing solutions. While some of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer histories as well as greater financial resources, we believe we compete favorably and our product capabilities meet customer requirements due to our data-driven, multichannel sales approach, our experienced digital sales force and our overall customer satisfaction.
 
While very few of our local media operations have similar daily print competitors that are published in the same city, our local media operations compete with other media including magazines, radio, television, outdoor/billboard advertising, other classified and specialty publications, other print publications both free and paid, direct mail, directories, and national, regional and local advertising websites and content providers. 
  The number of competitors in any given market varies, however all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in all of our markets.
 
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
 
We are a major subscription platform providing trusted, local information, news, and an innovative, digitally focused marketing solutions company. Our focus is the local market - including local news and information, marketing solutions for local advertisers, and digital services for local content curators. To align with the core strength of our company, our digital transformation strategy is locally focused and revolves around three pillars:
 
To align with customer expectations, we will transform the way we present local news, information, and viewpoints, both in digital and print. We seek to maintain our position as the leading provider of news and information by providing best-in-class digital experiences to improve consumer engagement and grow our audiences. We aim to achieve this by delivering relevant, useful, and engaging content to the consumer using a multi-media approach with a heavy emphasis on video and audio.
 
In 2022, we look to create new content and video channels by growing our multimedia capabilities leveraging the high quality, trusted, engaging content we produce locally to tap into these growing market segments. Through strategic investments in talent and technology, we aim to continuously improve the user experience with our digital products and to expand our digital product offerings where we have niche expertise.
 
We believe that our proprietary local content displayed in best-in-class multimedia platforms combined with new and engaging content and video channels will grow our audiences and increase our audience monetization capabilities.
 
We will accelerate subscription growth, transforming our print-centric audience model to a robust digital subscription model. We are one of the fastest growing digital subscription platforms in local media. In 2021, our total paid audiences (including print and digital) increased for the first time in several years. Digital only subscriber growth accelerated in 2021, offsetting the declines in our traditional full access (print and digital) subscribers. In 2021, we reached 50 million unique visitors across all of our digital platforms, with 393 million page views in September. Our digital audiences are comprised of full access subscribers, digital-only subscribers and non-subscribers who access our sites subject to our paywalls. More than 60% of our full access subscribers have activated their digital access and digital-only subscribers increased 65% in 2021, reaching 402,000 digital-only subscribers.
 
Our acquisition and retention tactics are focused on growing our digital subscription base by using data and analytics to direct our huge addressable market of 50 million unique visitors toward obtaining a digital subscription. In 2022, we expect to implement an ongoing, comprehensive marketing campaign focused on aggressively promoting dynamic video and graphic content that drives consumption, engagement and ultimately feeds consumers down our digital subscription funnel.
 

    2 

  

Using these techniques, we expect digital-only subscribers to continue to grow substantially, reaching more than 900,000 digital-only subscribers by 2026.
 
We believe our digital transformation will have a favorable impact on the environment. A key component to our digital growth strategy is to accelerate the pace of digital subscriber growth. Growing our digital business as the legacy business wanes will have a favorable impact on the environment as our production hubs will consume less energy, we will consume less newsprint and there will be less environmental impact from our distribution channels that largely operate on fossil-fuel powered transportation.
 
We will diversify and transform the services and products we offer advertisers and dramatically expand our local advertiser base. According to eMarketer, local advertising spending is expected to reach nearly $115 billion in 2022. Our vast array of rapidly growing digital products, our large, digitally adept salesforce and Amplified, our high powered full service digital agency, creates a powerful opportunity to gain scale both in and outside of our local markets.
 

• | Our local sales forces are larger than any local competitor, and we believe they are the most highly trained and proficient sales force in our markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have strong relationships with businesses in our markets and offer a wide array of products to deliver our advertisers' message.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our sales executives pitch the power of our audiences directly to local decision makers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have a world-class sales force, managed and supported centrally to ensure the highest digital talent is recruited, developed and retained to meet our clients' needs. Amplified is the backbone of our sales force and supports our local operators by providing lead generation, developing highly sophisticated proposals and provides all of the essential digital marketing services including web development, social media management, email marketing, fulfillment and search that most sophisticated advertisers are looking for. Amplified also provides our advertisers with the best data and metrics in order for them to maximize their advertising ROI. Amplified is a powerful organization that will help us improve our advertising revenue trends in 2022 and beyond.
 
TownNews represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue through their SaaS content platform. In 2021, revenue at TownNews, including intercompany revenue, totaled more than $27,197,000 and since 2011 the compounded annual growth rate of TownNews revenue has been 10.5%. Through continuous investment in product development and gaining essential technology, like world-class video and streaming technology, TownNews is the leading CMS provider in the publishing CMS segment and is growing its market share in the broadcast CMS segment. In 2022, we believe we can grow revenue at TownNews through modest market share gains in our core markets, increasing our average revenue per customer.

NEWSPRINT 
 
The raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can affect our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, included herein.

EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
We believe the foundation of our business is the people and employees who carry out the various tactics that support our business strategy. A major focus in 2021 was our integration of BH Media Group and the Buffalo News into common platforms and operating structures that manage all aspects of the employee experience including communication, performance management and benefits. This integration allows us to provide a unified approach to our digital transformation efforts. 
 
At September 26, 2021, we had approximately 5,130 employees, including approximately 915 part-time employees, exclusive of TNI and MNI. Full-time equivalent employees in 2021 totaled approximately 4,793 of which 805 are represented by unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. We are committed to an equitable and inclusive workplace that also reflects the diversity of our local readers and communities in which we serve. This past year, we hired a Director of News and Talent Development who is charged with improving diversity in our newsrooms and hiring practices that promote a more complete and inclusive news coverage of the communities in which we serve.
 
We continue to demonstrate our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by assessing our hiring practices, extending our hiring reach, providing skill-building opportunities on diverse storytelling, and developing business strategies that include historically marginalized communities. These efforts and initiatives will help us reach our goal of a more diverse workforce at all levels of our company.
 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC INFORMATION 
 
We have a long history of sound corporate governance practices. Currently, our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that six of its eight members are independent, including all members of the Board's Audit, Executive Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees. The Audit Committee approves all services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm and its affiliates.
 
At www.lee.net, one may access a wide variety of information, including news releases, SEC filings, financial statistics, annual reports, investor presentations, governance documents, newspaper profiles and digital links. We make available via our website all filings made by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and related amendments, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
