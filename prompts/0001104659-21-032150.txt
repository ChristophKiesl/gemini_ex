Overview
 
We are a diversified clinical-stage company developing therapeutics designed to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in areas of high unmet need. Our lead clinical development candidates are: (1) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to degrade certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics within the GI tract to prevent microbiome damage, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, and (2) SYN-020, a recombinant oral formulation of the enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) produced under cGMP conditions and intended to treat both local GI and systemic diseases.
 
We plan to explore and evaluate a range of strategic options, which may include: in-licensing opportunities; evaluation of potential acquisitions; or other potential strategic transactions. In the meantime, we remain focused on working with our clinical development partners to advance the planned Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients, and advancing the clinical development program for SYN-020 intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) in multiple potential indications.

Our Gastrointestinal (GI) and Microbiome-Focused Pipeline
 
Our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-020 clinical programs are focused on the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and the gut microbiome, which is home to billions of microbial species and composed of a natural balance of both “good” beneficial species and potentially “bad” pathogenic species. When the natural balance or normal function of these microbial species is disrupted, a person’s health can be compromised. All of our programs are supported by our growing intellectual property portfolio. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications.
 
SYN-004 (ribaxamase) — Prevention of antibiotic-mediated microbiome damage, C. difficile infections (CDI), overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic HCT recipients
 
SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is a proprietary oral capsule prophylactic therapy designed to degrade certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics excreted into the GI tract and thereby maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome. Preventing beta-lactam damage to the gut microbiome has a range of potential therapeutic outcomes, including prevention of CDI, suppression of the overgrowth of pathogenic species (particularly antimicrobial-resistant organisms) and potentially reducing the incidence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is a beta-lactamase enzyme intended to be co-administered with certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics as two-75 mg capsules which, when released in the proximal small intestine, has been shown to degrade beta-lactam antibiotics in the GI tract without altering systemic antibiotic levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay in hospital infection management and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics.
 
Clostridioides difficile Infection
 
Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile and often called C. difficile or CDI) is the leading type of hospital acquired infection and is frequently associated with IV beta-lactam antibiotic treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified C. difficile as an “urgent public health threat,” particularly given its resistance to many drugs used to treat other infections. CDI is a major unintended risk associated with the prophylactic or therapeutic use of IV antibiotics, which may adversely alter the natural balance of microflora that normally protect the GI tract, leading to C. difficile overgrowth and infection. Other risk factors for CDI include hospitalization, prolonged length of stay (estimated at 7 days), underlying illness, and immune-compromising conditions including the administration of chemotherapy and advanced age. According to a paper published in BMC Infectious Diseases (Desai K et al. BMC Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 303) the economic cost of CDI was approximately $5.4 billion in 2016 ($4.7 billion in healthcare settings; $725 million in the community) in the U.S., mostly due to hospitalizations.
Limitations of Current Treatments and Market Opportunity
 
CDI is a widespread and often drug resistant infectious disease. Approximately 20% of patients who have been diagnosed with CDI experience a recurrence of CDI within one to three months. Furthermore, controlling the spread of CDI has proven challenging, as the C. difficile spores are easily transferred to patients via normal contact with healthcare personnel and with inanimate objects. There is currently no vaccine or approved product for the prevention of primary (incident) CDI. The current standard of care for primary CDI, as outlined by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), is to treat with powerful antibiotics such as fidaxomicin or vancomycin. Prolonged use of fidaxomicin and vancomycin has been shown to further exacerbate damage to the gut microbiome, leading to increased risk of CDI recurrence as well as the emergence of pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). AMR is a serious global threat and one which world leaders have begun to take action against. According to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infections Disease (ECCMID), failure to address AMR could lead to a potential antibiotic Armageddon, resulting in 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050 and may cost as much as $100 trillion in worldwide economic output.

According to a paper published in BMC Infectious Diseases (Desai K (2016) Epidemiological and economic burden of Clostridium difficile in the United States: estimates from a modeling approach. BMC Infect Dis 16: 303), it is estimated that approximately 606,000 patients are infected with C. difficile annually in the U.S., and it has been reported that approximately 44,500 deaths are attributable to CDI-associated complications each year. According to IMS Health Incorporated*, in 2016, the potential addressable market for SYN-004 (ribaxamase) included approximately 227 million doses of intravenous Penicillin and Cephalosporin antibiotics which were administered in the United States and which may contribute to the onset of CDI. Additional data derived from IMS Health Incorporated states that in 2016, the worldwide market for SYN-004 (ribaxamase)-addressable intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics was approximately 7.5 billion doses, which may represent a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity for us. If approved, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) would be the first therapeutic intervention indicated to prevent the onset of antibiotic-mediated primary CDI.
 
Phase 1a and 1b Clinical Trial Pharmacokinetic Data
 
In March 2015, we reported supportive pharmacokinetic data from a Phase 1a clinical trial, which suggested that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) should have no effect on the IV antibiotic in the bloodstream, allowing the antibiotic to fight the primary infection. In February 2015, we reported supportive topline results from a subsequent Phase 1b clinical trial of escalating doses of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase), with no safety or tolerability issues reported at dose levels and dosing regimens that were equivalent to or exceeded those expected to be studied in subsequent clinical trials. The Phase 1a (40 participants) and 1b (24 participants) clinical trials of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) were initiated in December 2014.
Two Phase 2a Clinical Trials: Topline Results
 
In December 2015, we reported supportive topline results from our first Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase). The study demonstrated that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) successfully degraded IV ceftriaxone in the chyme of ten participants with ileostomies without affecting the levels of ceftriaxone in the bloodstream. In May 2016, we reported supportive topline results from a second Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in 14 healthy participants with functioning ileostomies administered IV ceftriaxone with and without oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase). This second study demonstrated that the 150 mg dose of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), both alone and in the presence of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI), esomeprazole, degraded ceftriaxone excreted into the chyme resulting in ceftriaxone levels that were low or not-detectable. Ceftriaxone plasma concentrations in participants of the second study were not altered by SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in the presence or absence of an oral PPI, suggesting limited drug-drug interactions. The 150 mg dose strength of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) was well tolerated by all participants in this clinical trial.
Phase 2b Proof of Concept Clinical Trial Design & Results
 
In September 2015, we initiated a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical study in 412 patients (206 per group).
 
On January 5, 2017, we announced positive topline data from our Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial intended to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to prevent CDI, CDAD (C. difficile-associated diarrhea) and AAD (antibiotic-associated diarrhea) in patients hospitalized for a lower respiratory tract infection and receiving IV ceftriaxone. Results from this study demonstrated that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) achieved its primary endpoint of significantly reducing CDI. Preliminary analysis of the data indicated seven confirmed cases of CDI in the placebo group compared to two cases in the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treatment group. Patients receiving SYN-004 (ribaxamase) achieved a 71.4% relative risk reduction (p-value=0.045) in CDI rates compared to patients receiving placebo. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treated patients also demonstrated a significant reduction in new colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) compared to placebo (p-value=0.002). Results from this trial also demonstrated that patients administered ribaxamase in conjunction with IV-ceftriaxone demonstrated comparable cure rates (approximately 94%) for the treatment of primary infection compared to the placebo group. Results from this trial also demonstrated that the percentage of subjects reporting at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and placebo treatment groups (40.8% vs 44.2%). Adverse events reported during this trial were comparable between treatment and placebo arms. Serious adverse events (SAEs) in the treatment arm, including fatal AEs which exceeded those in the placebo arm, were not considered drug-related by investigators at the clinical sites, or by an independent third-party, each of whom determined SAEs were attributable to disparities in the underlying health and comorbidities between the groups.

On October 6, 2016 we were awarded a government contract in the amount of $521,014 by the CDC’s Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 2016-N-17812 to examine changes in the gut resistome of patients in our Phase 2b clinical study. Data generated under this contract are consistent with SYN-004’s (ribaxamase) mode of action of preserving the normal gut flora by degrading ceftriaxone in the upper GI tract of study participants treated with SYN-004 (ribaxamase). The data further demonstrated that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) significantly reduced the loss of microbial diversity, reduced overgrowth of opportunistically pathogenic species, and reduced the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (such as VRE) caused by ceftriaxone treatment in SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treated patients compared to placebo.
 
Future Planning and Potential Regulatory Strategy for Prevention of Primary CDI
 
On November 21, 2018, we announced results from our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA during which key elements of a Phase 3 clinical program were confirmed. Pursuant to the meeting, the FDA proposed criteria for Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety which, if achieved, may support submission for marketing approval of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) on the basis of a single Phase 3 clinical trial. The proposed SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Phase 3 clinical program will entail a single, global, event-driven clinical trial with a fixed maximum number of approximately 4,000 patients for total enrollment and will evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of ribaxamase in a broad patient population by enrolling patients with a variety of underlying infections treated with a range of IV beta-lactam antibiotics.
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this Phase 3 clinical trial will be the reduction in the incidence of CDI at one month after the last drug dose in the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treatment group versus placebo. We expect the clinical development costs to complete this trial to be in excess of $80 million and anticipate initiating the Phase 3 clinical program only after securing additional potential financing via a strategic partnership.
 
Acute Graft-Versus-Host-Disease in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (allogeneic HCT) Recipients & SYN-004 (ribaxamase)
 
In parallel with our clinical and regulatory efforts, we completed a Health Economics Outcomes Research (HEOR) study, which was conducted to generate key insights on how we can expect Health Care Practitioners, or HCPs, to evaluate patient access for SYN-004 (ribaxamase) while also providing a framework for potential reimbursement strategies. After evaluating findings from the study, we believe that there is significant potential value in exploring the development of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in a narrower patient population where the incidence of the disease endpoint is high and the clinical development may be less costly.
 
We believe allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, who have a very high risk of CDI, VRE colonization and potentially fatal bacteremia, and acute-graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD) represent such a patient population. Published literature has demonstrated a strong association between these adverse outcomes and microbiome damage caused by IV beta-lactam antibiotics in these patients. Approximately 80-90% of HCT recipients receive IV beta-lactam antibiotics to treat febrile neutropenia. Penicillins and cephalosporins are first-line therapies in the USA and EU, whereas carbapenems are first-line in China. Antibiotic-mediated damage to the gut microbiome is strongly associated with GVHD, bloodstream infections, VRE bacteremia, transplant relapse, and increased mortality in HCT recipients, raising concern over the spectrum of antibiotics used during HCT.
 
CDI occurs in up to 31% of HCT patients and is associated with GVHD and increased mortality. aGVHD occurs in 30-60% of allogeneic HCT recipients and is recognized as a primary contributor to morbidity and mortality in this patient population. In 2018, there were approximately 9,000 reported allogeneic HCT procedures in the USA, an estimated 19,800 procedures in Europe, 9,600 in China, and 3,500 in Japan. First-line treatments for aGVHD fail in more than 50% of patients and 2-year survival in patients with steroid refractory aGVHD is only 20%. At least one U.S. study found allogeneic HCT recipients who developed aGVHD had 3-times higher in-hospital mortality and almost 2-fold higher median hospital costs than patients who did not develop aGVHD. It has been reported that in-patient costs for allogeneic HCT in the USA range from $180,000-$300,000 depending on the disease severity. In 2014, all-cause costs for allogeneic HCT in the USA were greater than $600,000 per patient (up to 12 months post-transplant). VRE infection is a persistent problem in HCT patients and VRE colonization after HCT has been associated with decreased patient survival.

Phase 1b/2a Clinical Study in Allogeneic HCT Recipients
 
In August 2019, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) with the Washington University School of Medicine (Washington University) to conduct a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase). Under the terms of this agreement, we will serve as the sponsor of the study and supply SYN-004 (ribaxamase). Dr. Erik R. Dubberke, Professor of Medicine and Clinical Director, Transplant Infectious Diseases at Washington University and a member of the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) steering committee will serve as the principal investigator of the clinical trial in collaboration with his Washington University colleague Dr. Mark A. Schroeder, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia.
 
On January 7, 2020, we announced the receipt of official meeting minutes from the FDA following a Type-C meeting held on December 2, 2019 at our request to discuss the development of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) for treatment of allogeneic HCT recipients who are administered IV beta-lactam antibiotics in response to fever. Based on the final meeting minutes, the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial will comprise a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in up to 36 evaluable adult allogeneic HCT recipients. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and potential absorption into the systemic circulation (if any) of 150 mg oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase) administered to allogeneic HCT recipients four times per day who receive an IV beta-lactam antibiotic to treat fever. Study participants will be enrolled into three sequential cohorts administered a different study-assigned IV beta-lactam antibiotic. Eight participants in each cohort will receive SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and four will receive placebo. Safety and pharmacokinetic data for each cohort will be reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which will make a recommendation on whether to proceed to the next IV beta-lactam antibiotic. The study will also evaluate potential protective effects of SYN-004 on the gut microbiome as well as generate preliminary information on potential therapeutic benefits and patient outcomes of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients.
 
On July 30, 2020, we received written notification from the FDA informing us that they determined the Phase 1b/2a clinical program in adult allogeneic HCT recipients may proceed per the submitted clinical program protocol. On December 22, 2020, we announced we received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Washington University to commence the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004. During the first quarter of 2021, Washington University began screening patients for enrollment of the first of three antibiotic cohorts in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients. If enrollment proceeds as planned, we may be positioned to announce as many as three interim data readouts during the next 12-18 months with the first one anticipated from the first antibiotic cohort towards the end of 2021, pandemic conditions permitting.
 
Due to the unique challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Washington University continues to evaluate non-essential activities which may have a direct impact on planned and ongoing clinical trials. Continuation of the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial including, but not limited to, the enrollment of new patients remains largely at the discretion of Washington University and is contingent upon their ability to conduct this clinical program free from the impact of COVID-19. We remain in close contact with Washington University and are actively monitoring the crisis caused by the spread of COVID-19 and its impact to the clinical development plans for our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) program.
 
SYN-020 — Oral Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP)
 
SYN-020 is a quality-controlled, recombinant version of bovine Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) produced under cGMP conditions and formulated for oral delivery. The published literature indicates that IAP functions to diminish GI inflammation, tighten the gut barrier to diminish “leaky gut,” promote a healthy microbiome, and diminish GI and systemic inflammation. Despite its broad therapeutic potential, a key hurdle to commercialization has been the high cost of IAP manufacture which is commercially available for as much as $10,000 per gram. We believe we have developed technologies to traverse this hurdle and now have the ability to produce more than 3 grams per liter of SYN-020 for roughly a few hundred dollars per gram at commercial scale. Based on the known mechanisms as well as our own supporting animal model data, we intended to initially develop SYN-020 to mitigate the intestinal damage caused by radiation therapy that is routinely used to treat pelvic cancers, including the treatment and prevention of radiation enteropathy secondary to cancer therapy. And, while we believe SYN-020 may play a pivotal role in addressing acute and long-term complications associated with radiation exposure to the GI tract, we have begun planning to develop SYN-020 in indications that may offer a more accelerated or streamlined pathway to registration while also addressing significant unmet medical needs. Such indications include, celiac disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), and indications supported by our collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”). Across the six major markets, the total prevalent cases of celiac disease are expected to increase from 5.8 million cases in 2013 to an expected 8.1 million cases in 2023, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 4%. During the same period, prevalent cases in the U.S. are expected to increase from 2.8 million in 2013 to an expected 4.3 million in 2023, representing a significant market opportunity.
 
On June 30, 2020, we submitted an IND application to the FDA in support of an initial indication for the treatment of radiation enteropathy secondary to pelvic cancer therapy. On July 30, 2020, we announced that we received a study-may-proceed letter from the FDA to conduct a Phase 1 single-ascending-dose (“SAD”) study in healthy volunteers designed to evaluate SYN-020 for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters. Enrollment is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2021 and a topline data readout is anticipated during the third quarter of 2021. Planning for a second Phase 1 study evaluating multiple-ascending doses (“MAD”) of SYN-020 is also underway and anticipated to commence during the third quarter of 2021. A topline data readout of the Phase 1 MAD clinical study is anticipated during the first quarter of 2022, pandemic conditions permitting. Following the completion of Phase 1 safety studies, we may consider conducting a placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a challenge study in as many as 40 celiac patients who present with predominantly GI symptoms followed by a Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial in a similar patient population. We may also seek to initiate clinical trials of SYN-020 evaluating its potential therapeutic benefit in NAFLD patients.
 
During the second quarter of 2020, we announced that we entered into an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital granting us an option for an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to the use of IAP to maintain GI and microbiome health, diminish systemic inflammation, and treat age-related diseases. Research published by a team of investigators led by Richard Hodin, MD, Chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital Division of General and Gastrointestinal Surgery and Professor of Surgery, Harvard Medical School, evaluated long-term oral supplementation of IAP, including SYN-020, in mice. Dr. Hodin’s research demonstrated that IAP administration, starting at 10 months of age, slowed the microbiome changes, gut-barrier dysfunction, and gastrointestinal and systemic inflammation that normally accompany aging. Additionally, the IAP administration resulted in improved metabolic profiles in the aged mice, diminished frailty, and extended lifespan. Under the terms of the agreement, we are granted exclusive rights to negotiate a worldwide license with MGH to commercially develop SYN-020 to treat and prevent metabolic and inflammatory diseases associated with aging. If executed, we plan to use this license in the advancement of an expanded clinical development program for SYN-020.

SYN-010 — Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)
 
On December 5, 2013, through our majority owned subsidiary, SYN Biomics, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement (the “CSMC License Agreement”) for the right to develop, manufacture, use, and sell products, including SYN-010, for the human and veterinary therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for acute and chronic diseases. SYN-010 is a modified-release formulation of lovastatin lactone that was intended to reduce methane production by certain microorganisms (Methanobrevibacter smithii) in the gut while minimizing disruption to the microbiome.

Investigator-Sponsored Phase 2b clinical study
 
On September 5, 2018, we entered into an agreement with CSMC for an investigator-sponsored Phase 2b clinical study of SYN-010 to be co-funded by us and CSMC in order to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYN-010.
 
The Phase 2b study was being conducted out of the Medically Associated Science and Technology (MAST) Program at CSMC and was a 12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial to evaluate two dose strengths of oral SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg in as many as 150 patients diagnosed with IBS-C using a breath methane screening level as a criteria for patient enrollment.
 
The primary objective for the study was to determine the efficacy of SYN-010, measured as an improvement from baseline in the weekly average number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) during the 12-week treatment period for SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg daily doses relative to placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints for both dose strengths of SYN-010 measured changes from baseline in abdominal pain, bloating and stool frequency as well as the use of rescue medication relative to placebo. Exploratory outcomes include adequate relief and quality of life measures using the well-validated EQ-5D-5L and PAC-SYM patient questionnaires.
 
Enrollment in this study commenced in January 2019 and was temporarily halted during the first and second quarter of 2020 due to the unique challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic which required CSMC to temporarily limit all non-essential activities, directly impacting their ability to actively recruit and screen new patients.
 
During the third quarter of 2020, a planned interim futility analysis of the Phase 2b investigator-sponsored clinical study was completed. Based on the review of the interim analysis, it was concluded that although SYN-010 was well-tolerated, it failed to meet the prespecified efficacy criteria and was unlikely to meet the primary objective of the study by the time enrollment was completed. On September 30, 2020, CSMC formally agreed to discontinue the study and on November 9, 2020 we and CSMC mutually agreed to terminate the Exclusive License Agreement. CSMC has been unblinded and intends to conduct a comprehensive review of the data set and publish its findings.
 
Research Programs
 
Our research programs are primarily directed to the development of GI acting products that have generated preclinical proof-of-concept with two pipeline products (SYN-006 and SYN-007) that expand the potential utility of our beta-lactamase strategy. Our SYN-005 monoclonal antibody program is being developed to both treat and prevent pertussis.

SYN-007 — Prevention of CDI, overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
 
We are currently developing two pipeline products to expand the potential utility of our beta-lactamase strategy. SYN-007 is a specially formulated version of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) designed to degrade orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics to protect the gut microbiome from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis. SYN-007 is formulated for release in the distal small intestine to allow systemic absorption of the oral antibiotic while still providing protection upstream of the colon and to the gut microbiome. SYN-007 is designed for patients who have been administered SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in combination with intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics and who are then transferred to an oral beta-lactam antibiotic, thereby extending gut microbiome protection from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis. An additional indication of potential interest is the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in patients being treated with amoxicillin clavulanate. Data from a canine study completed during the second half of 2017 demonstrated that, when co-administered with oral amoxicillin, oral SYN-007 did not interfere with amoxicillin absorption and did demonstrate protection of the gut microbiome. The data from this canine study were presented during microbiome conferences in 2017 and 2018. Additional data was reported in 2019 from a dose-response canine study which demonstrated SYN-007 mitigated antibiotic-mediated gut microbiome alteration and maintained gut microbiome integrity when co-administered with oral amoxicillin. During the first quarter of 2020, we reported additional supporting preclinical data demonstrating SYN-007 protected the gut microbiome of dogs from amoxicillin and the beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination amoxicillin/clavulanate and also reduced the emergence of antibiotic resistance in a canine study. Additional preclinical work in the canine model will seek to optimize the dose of SYN-007.
 
SYN-006 — Prevention of CDI, overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
 
SYN-006 has the potential to further expand the utility of our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) program to a broader spectrum of IV beta-lactam antibiotics in the GI tract to include carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenems are broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics that have been shown to significantly damage the gut microbiome, incur a high risk for C. difficile infection, and enable GI overgrowth with multidrug resistant organisms. Carbapenems are frequently a last line of defense antibiotic, therefore the emergence and spread of carbapenem resistance presents an urgent threat. SYN-006 is a carbapenemase designed to degrade intravenous (IV) carbapenem antibiotics within the GI tract to maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI, overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is anticipated that, by protecting the gut microbiome from exposure to carbapenem antibiotics, SYN-006 may potentially diminish the spread of such resistance. At the ID Week 2017 conference, we presented a poster demonstrating SYN-006’s broad activity against four carbapenem antibiotics as well as efficacy in a canine model. The poster also showed data from a porcine model indicating that the carbapenem ertapenem and potently damaged gut microbiomes and mediated expansion of antibiotic resistance genes in the GI tract. We have successfully formulated SYN-006 for oral delivery and evaluated it in a porcine efficacy model in conjunction with IV ertapenem. The data, presented at a clinical conference during the first quarter of 2018, demonstrated that SYN-006 did not interfere with serum levels of ertapenem and did diminish antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis. In addition to its potential ability to prevent IV carbapenem-mediated CDI and AMR, additional clinical indications for SYN-006 could include prevention of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in cancer chemotherapy patients. Carbapenems are a first-line treatment for febrile neutropenia (FN) in hematologic cancer patients in China. Infection by CRE is a recognized and increasing health threat in China where the estimated CRE infection rate is between 10% and 20% in non-HCT chemotherapy patients and is associated with high mortality. In 2019, we reported additional supportive preclinical data demonstrating SYN-006 attenuated emergence of antibiotic resistance in a pig model, including encoded beta-lactamases and genes conferring resistance to a broad range of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and macrolides.

SYN-005 — Pertussis (Whooping Cough)
 
The SYN-005 program is developing monoclonal antibodies both as a prophylaxis and a treatment for pertussis. Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the upper respiratory tract, causing uncontrollable and violent coughing. Antibiotic treatment does not have a major effect on the course of pertussis. While such treatment can eliminate the B. pertussis bacteria from the respiratory tract, it does not neutralize the pertussis toxin. Infants with pertussis often require hospitalization in pediatric intensive care units, frequently requiring mechanical ventilation. The incidence of pertussis is increasing due to the declining effectiveness of the acellular vaccine introduced in the 1990s, exposure of unvaccinated and under-vaccinated individuals including infants who are not yet fully vaccinated and exposure of individuals whose immunity has diminished over time.
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are an estimated 24.1 million worldwide cases of whooping cough and about 160,700 deaths per year primarily among unvaccinated children younger than 5 years of age.
 
In April 2014, and again in September 2014, we received positive preclinical research findings of SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis in three non-human primate studies (n = 19). In the latter two pertussis studies in particular, SYN-005 rapidly stopped the rise in white blood cell count that is characteristic of the disease and accelerated its return to baseline.
 
In September 2014, we received U.S. Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis.
 
In October 2015, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a grant to The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) to generate preclinical proof-of-concept data in the neonatal non-human primate model to test the hypothesis that antibody administration at birth may have a role in the prevention of pertussis.
 
In December 2015, the non-human primate prophylaxis study was initiated by UT Austin to determine if administration of hu1B7, one component of SYN-005, at two days of age could protect animals from a subsequent pertussis infection.
 
On April 19, 2017, we announced supportive preclinical data demonstrating hu1B7 provided five weeks of protection from pertussis in neonatal non-human primates. Control animals (n=6), infected with Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) at five weeks of age demonstrated marked elevations in white blood cell counts and most exhibited behavioral signs of pertussis, including coughing and diminished activity. In contrast, the experimental animals (n=7), who were treated with hu1B7 at two days of age and then infected five weeks later, had significantly lower peak white blood cell counts (p=0.004) that remained within the normal range or were only slightly elevated. Importantly, all seven of the animals that received prophylactic hu1B7 appeared healthy and none exhibited any behavioral signs of pertussis. Building on this early success, we performed preclinical testing of a modified version of hu1B7 that has the potential to extend the plasma half-life. The modified hu1B7 achieved higher plasma levels at five weeks than the parental hu1B7 antibody and was efficacious in preventing clinical pertussis. The extended half-life antibody has the potential to substantially reduce the required dose and cost for prophylaxis for application in the Developing World. This study expands the potential clinical utility beyond treatment to also include prophylaxis.

Intellectual Property
 
All of our programs are supported by growing patent estates that we either own or exclusively license. In total, we have over 90 U.S. and foreign patents and over 70 U.S. and foreign patents pending. The SYN-004 (ribaxamase) program is supported by IP that is assigned to Synthetic Biologics, namely U.S. patents and foreign patents (in most major markets, e.g. Europe (including Germany, Great Britain and France), Japan, China and Canada, among others) and U.S. and foreign patents pending in most major markets, e.g. Europe (including Germany, Great Britain and France), Japan, China and Canada, among others). For instance, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,894,994 and 9,587,234, which include claims to compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of beta-lactamases, including SYN-004 (ribaxamase), have patent terms to at least 2031. Further, U.S. Patent 9,301,995 and 9,301,996, both of which will expire in 2031, cover various uses of beta-lactamases, including SYN-004 (ribaxamase), in protecting the microbiome, and U.S. Patent Nos. 9,290,754, 9,376,673, 9,404,103, 9,464,280, and 9,695,409 which will expire in at least 2035, covers further beta-lactamase compositions of matter related to SYN-004 (ribaxamase).
 
The SYN-020 (oral intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP)) program is supported by IP that is assigned to Synthetic Biologics, namely U.S. and foreign patent applications (in many major markets, e.g. Europe, Canada, and Australia). These patent applications, which cover various formulations, medical uses and manufacture of SYN-020, are expected to expire in 2038-2040, if granted, and without taking potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustment into account.
 
Our goal is to (i) obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods, and other proprietary technologies, (ii) preserve our trade secrets, and (iii) operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties worldwide. We seek, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection for product candidates, proprietary information, and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents.
 
Our Collaborations
 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center License Agreement
 
On December 5, 2013, through our majority owned subsidiary, SYN Biomics, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement (the “CSMC License Agreement”) for the right to develop, manufacture, use, and sell products for the human and veterinary therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for acute and chronic diseases. The portfolio of intellectual property licensed to SYN Biomics under the CSMC License Agreement included nine issued U.S. patents, 30 issued patents in various European countries, three issued Australian patents, one Canadian patent and one issued Japanese patent as well as several pending U.S. and international patent applications for most fields of use and modalities subject to certain agreed-upon exceptions.
 
Under the terms of the CSMC License Agreement we issued 9,569 unregistered shares of our common stock to CSMC, as payment of an initial license fee and patent reimbursement fees of $150,000 and $220,000, respectively. The parties also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with respect to such stock issuance and other issuances of unregistered shares of our common stock that may be issued to CSMC in lieu of cash, including license fees, milestone payments, expense reimbursements and option fees under the CSMC License Agreement. Commencing on the second anniversary of the CSMC License Agreement, SYN Biomics began paying an annual maintenance fee, which payment was creditable against annual royalty payments owed under the CSMC License Agreement. In addition to royalty payments which are a percentage (in the low single digits and are subject to reduction under certain circumstances) of Net Sales (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement) of Licensed Products (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement) and Licensed Technology products (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement), SYN Biomics was obligated to pay CSMC a percentage of any non-royalty sublicense revenues (ranging from 20% if prior to initiation of Phase 3 clinical trial to 15% if after initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial). During the year ended December 31, 2016, SYN Biomics paid CSMC an aggregate of $350,000 in milestone payments and was obligated to pay CSMC additional consideration up to $3,500,000 upon the achievement of the following milestones (i) initiation of Phase 3 dosing for each additional indication of a Licensed Product or Licensed Technology Product; (ii) successful Phase 3 trial completion for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; (iii) the FDA’s acceptance of a New Drug Application for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; (iv) regulatory approval for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; and (vi) the first commercial sale of each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product. There were no milestone payments made during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Prior to the execution of the CSMC License Agreement, SYN Biomics issued shares of common stock of SYN Biomics to each of CSMC and Dr. Mark Pimentel (the primary inventor of the intellectual property), representing 11.5% and 8.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of SYN Biomics (the “SYN Biomics Shares”). The Stock Purchase Agreements for the SYN Biomics Shares provide for certain anti-dilution protection until such time as an aggregate of $3.0 million in proceeds from equity financings are received by SYN Biomics as well as a right, under certain circumstances in the event that the SYN Biomics Shares are not then freely tradeable, and subject to NYSE American, LLC approval, as of the 18 and 36 month anniversary date of the effective date of the Stock Purchase Agreements, for each of CSMC and Dr. Pimentel to exchange up to 50% of their SYN Biomics Shares for unregistered shares of our common stock, with the rate of exchange based upon the relative contribution of the valuation of SYN Biomics to the public market valuation of us at the time of each exchange. The Stock Purchase Agreements also provide for tag-along rights in the event of the sale by us of our shares of SYN Biomics.
 
On August 29, 2015, Dr. Pimentel notified us of his intent to exchange all of the shares of common stock in SYN Biomics owned by him for 38,572 shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Pimentel Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended and the exchange was effectuated on August 31, 2015. We filed a “resale” registration statement to register 5,715 shares issued to Dr. Pimentel, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 15, 2015.
 
On September 5, 2018, we entered into an agreement with CSMC for CSMC to conduct an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical study of SYN-010 to be co-funded by us and CSMC (the “Study”).
 
In consideration of the support provided by CSMC for the Study, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with CSMC pursuant to which we: (i) issued to CSMC fifty thousand (50,000) shares of our common stock; and (ii) transferred to CSMC an additional two million four hundred twenty thousand (2,420,000) shares of common stock of its SYN Biomics, Inc. owned by us, such that after such issuance CSMC owns an aggregate of seven million four hundred eighty thousand (7,480,000) shares of common stock of SYN Biomics, representing seventeen percent (17%) of the issued and outstanding shares of SYN Biomics’ common stock.
 
The Stock Purchase Agreement also provides CSMC with a right, commencing on the six month anniversary of issuance of the stock under certain circumstances in the event that the shares of stock of SYN Biomics are not then freely tradeable, and subject to NYSE American, LLC approval, to exchange its SYN Biomics shares for unregistered shares of our common stock, with the rate of exchange based upon the relative contribution of the valuation of SYN Biomics to the public market valuation of our company at the time of each exchange all subject to approval of the NYSE American, LLC. The Stock Purchase Agreement also provides for tag-along rights in the event of the sale by us of our shares of SYN Biomics.
 
During the third quarter of 2020, a planned interim futility analysis of the Phase 2b investigator-sponsored clinical study was completed. Based on the review of the interim analysis, it was concluded that although SYN-010 was well-tolerated, it failed to meet the prespecified efficacy criteria and was unlikely to meet the primary objective of the study by the time enrollment is completed. On September 30, 2020 CSMC formally agreed to discontinue the study and on November 9, 2020, we and CSMC mutually agreed to terminate the Exclusive License Agreement. CSMC has been unblinded and intends to conduct a comprehensive review of the data set and publish its findings.

Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis Clinical Trial Agreement
 
In August 7, 2019, we entered into a clinical trial agreement (“CTA”) with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (“Washington University”) to conduct a Phase 1b/2a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in up to 36 adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients (the “Study”). Under the terms of the CTA, we will serve as the sponsor of the Study and supply SYN-004 (ribaxamase), as well as compensate Washington University for all research services to be provided in connection with the Study which is estimated to cost approximately $3,200,000. Dr. Erik R. Dubberke, Professor of Medicine and Clinical Director, Transplant Infectious Diseases at Washington University will serve as the principal investigator of the trial in collaboration with his Washington University colleague Dr. Mark A. Schroeder, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia.
 
The CTA continues in effect until completion of all obligations under the CTA. Either party may terminate the CTA prior to completion of its obligations (i) if authorization of the study is withdrawn by the FDA; (ii) if the emergence of any adverse reaction or side effect with SYN-004 (ribaxamase) administered in the Study is of such magnitude or incidence in the opinion of either party to support termination; or (iii) upon a breach of the terms of the CTA if the breaching party fails to cure the breach within 30 days after receipt of notice. We have the right to terminate the CTA (i) effective immediately if Washington University fails to perform the study in accordance with the terms of the protocol, the CTA or applicable laws or regulations or if Washington University or the principal investigator become debarred or (ii) upon 14 days written notice and Washington University has the right to terminate the CTA upon 14 days notice if the principal investigator becomes unable to perform or complete the Study and the parties have not, prior to the expiration of such fourteen (14) day period, agreed to an alternative principal investigator.
 
Massachusetts General Hospital Exclusive Option License Agreement
 
On May 27, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) granting us an option for an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to the use of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (“IAP”) to maintain gastrointestinal (GI) and microbiome health, diminish systemic inflammation, and treat age-related diseases. If executed, we plan to use this license in the advancement of an expanded clinical development program for SYN-020, our proprietary recombinant version of bovine IAP currently in pre-clinical development. Under the terms of the agreement, Synthetic Biologics is granted exclusive rights to negotiate a worldwide license with MGH to commercially develop SYN-020 to treat and prevent metabolic and inflammatory diseases associated with aging.
The University of Texas at Austin License Agreement and Sponsored Research Agreement
 
On December 19, 2012, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the “Texas License Agreement”) with UT Austin for the exclusive license of the right to use, develop, manufacture, market and commercialize certain research and patents related to pertussis antibodies developed in the lab of Dr. Jennifer A. Maynard, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering. In accordance with the terms of the Texas License Agreement we made the following payments to the UT Austin: a payment of past patent expenses, an annual payment of $50,000 per year commencing on the effective date through December 31, 2014 and a $25,000 payment on December 31, 2015. The Texas License Agreement also provides that UT Austin is entitled to milestone payments of $50,000 upon commencement of Phase 1 Clinical Trials, $100,000 upon commencement of Phase 3 Clinical Trials, $250,000 upon NDA submission in the United States, $100,000 upon European Medicines Agency approval and $100,000 upon regulatory approval in an Asian country. In addition, the University is entitled to a running royalty upon Net Product Sales and Net Service Sales (as defined in the Texas License Agreement and currently projected to be 2037 (not accounting for possible extensions)). The License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of the patent rights (as defined in the Texas License Agreement); provided, however that the Texas License Agreement is subject to early termination by us in our discretion and by the University for a breach of the Texas License Agreement by us.
 
In connection with the Texas License Agreement, we also entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (the “Sponsored Research Agreement”) with the University pursuant to which the University will perform certain research work related to pertussis under the direction of Dr. Jennifer Maynard. All inventions conceived during such research shall be subject to the Texas License Agreement and we will obtain certain rights to patents and technology developed during the course of such research. We paid the University a fixed fee for the first year of $303,287 and the second and third years of $316,438 and $328,758, respectively. The Sponsored Research Agreement was amended on October 22, 2015, to extend its termination date to January 15, 2017, on September 2, 2016 to extend the agreement until January 15, 2018; on August 22, 2017 to extend the agreement until January 17, 2019; on August 24, 2018 to extend the agreement until January 21, 2021; and again on August 18, 2020 which extended the agreement until January 17, 2023; provided, however, the Sponsored Research Agreement is subject to early termination upon the written agreement of the parties, a default in the material obligations under the Sponsored Research Agreement which remain uncured for 60 days after receipt of notice, automatically upon our bankruptcy or insolvency and by us in our sole discretion at any time after the one year anniversary of the date of execution thereof upon no less than 90 days’ notice. Upon a termination or due to a breach by the University, we will only be responsible for all reasonable expenses that do not exceed the fixed annual amount and that are incurred by the University prior to the termination date for services performed prior to the termination date.
 
19

 

We have an issued U.S. patent and patents pending in the U.S. and internationally (e.g. Europe, China, Japan, Australia, and China) on compositions and uses of SYN-005 that are co-owned by UT Austin and ourselves or licensed to us, and we have an issued U.S. patent and patent applications on other pertussis mAbs licensed from UT Austin.
 
Infectious Disease Collaboration with Intrexon Corporation
 
On August 6, 2012, we entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration (“ECC”) with Intrexon (the “Infectious Disease ECC”) that governs a “channel collaboration” arrangement in which we intend to use Intrexon’s technology relating to the identification, design and production of human antibodies and DNA vectors for the development and commercialization of a series of human recombinant monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of pertussis (the “Field”). Such license is exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or other commercialization of our products within the Field (“Synthetic Products”), and otherwise is non-exclusive. We may not sublicense the rights described without Intrexon’s written consent. Under the Infectious Disease ECC, and subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for, among other things, the performance of the Program including the development, commercialization and manufacturing of products.
 
Subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the Infectious Disease ECC, we will pay Intrexon royalties on annual net sales of the Synthetic Products, calculated on a Synthetic Product-by-Synthetic Product basis. We have likewise agreed to pay Intrexon a percentage of quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement.
 
We may voluntarily terminate the Infectious Disease ECC upon 90 days written notice to Intrexon. Intrexon may also terminate the Infectious Disease ECC if we elect not to pursue the development of a Program identified by Intrexon that is a “Superior Therapy” as defined in the Infectious Disease ECC upon 60 days’ notice unless we remedy the circumstances giving rise to the termination during such notice period. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ notice if the other party commits a material breach of the Infectious Disease ECC, subject to certain cure periods.
 
20

 

Upon termination of the Infectious Disease ECC, we may continue to develop and commercialize any Synthetic Product that at the time of termination satisfies one of the following:
 

· | is being commercialized by us;
--+-------------------------------


· | has received regulatory approval;
--+----------------------------------


· | is a subject of an application for regulatory approval that is pending before the applicable regulatory authority;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | is a subject of at least a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial if such termination is by Intrexon due to a material breach by us of the Infectious Disease ECC or by us upon 60 days’ notice after the first 18 months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our obligation to pay the royalties described above with respect to these “retained” products will survive termination of the Infectious Disease ECC.
 
In the event of a termination of the Infectious Disease ECC, product candidates that are generating revenue or being considered for approval by the applicable regulatory body or have been approved by the applicable governing body (“Infectious Disease Retained Products”) at the time of the Infectious Disease ECC’s termination are retained by us, subject to Intrexon’s right to receive royalty payments. Except as necessary for us to continue to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize any Infectious Disease Retained Product, in the event of termination of the Infectious Disease ECC, all rights and licenses granted by Intrexon revert back to Intrexon and we must cease development and commercialization of all products candidates in the Field that are not Retained Products. Upon termination of the Infectious Disease ECC, Intrexon retains any technology access fees or other payments to which we have paid to Intrexon through the date of termination.
 
On October 16, 2012, we issued 101,492 shares of our common stock as consideration in connection with the Infectious Disease ECC and the related Stock Issuance Agreement with Intrexon that we entered into on August 6, 2012 (the “Second Stock Issuance Agreement”).
 
We also agreed upon the filing of an IND application with the FDA for a Synthetic Product, or alternatively the filing of the first equivalent regulatory filing with a foreign regulatory agency (both as applicable, the “IND Milestone Event”), to pay Intrexon either (i) $2.0 million in cash, or (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock (the “IND Milestone Shares”) having a fair market value equaling $2.0 million where such fair market value is determined using published market data of the share price for Common Stock at the close of market on the business day immediately preceding the date of public announcement of attainment of the IND Milestone Event.
 
Upon the first to occur of either first commercial sale of a Synthetic Product in a country or the granting of the regulatory approval of that Synthetic Product (both as applicable, the “Approval Milestone Event”), we agreed to pay to Intrexon either (i) $3.0 million in cash, or (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock (the “Approval Milestone Shares”) having a fair market value equaling $3.0 million where such fair market value is determined using published market data of the share price for Common Stock at the close of market on the business day immediately preceding the date of public announcement of attainment of the Approval Milestone Event. We will pay Intrexon royalties on annual net sales of products, calculated on a product-by-product basis, equal to a percent of net sales of Synthetic Products (ranging from mid-single digits on the first $100 million of net sales to mid-teen digits on net sales in excess of $100 million). We have likewise agreed to pay Intrexon a percentage of quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Second Stock Issuance Agreement, and pursuant to the First Amendment to Registration Rights Agreement executed and delivered by the parties at the closing, we filed a “resale” registration statement registering the resale of certain of the shares issued under the Second Stock Issuance Agreement.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our product candidates are biologics that can be readily synthesized by processes that we have developed; however, the manufacturing for our clinical programs, including SYN-004 and SYN-020 may require long lead times. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical activities. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and in most cases only one third-party, to manufacture critical raw materials, drug substance and final drug product for our research, preclinical development and clinical trial activities. Commercial quantities of any drugs we seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with the FDA and other regulations, and we plan to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of products we successfully develop through FDA approval. Although we believe we have sufficient quantities of SYN-004 and SYN-020 to complete our planned Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 and our planned Phase 1 clinical trials of SYN-020, we do not currently have a definitive agreement with any third-party vendors for the manufacture of additional quantities of SYN-004 and SYN-020 for potential future clinical trials.

Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred approximately $5.1 million and $11.1 million, respectively, in research and development expenses.
 
Government Regulation
 
In the U.S., the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including primarily the FDA. Our proposed activities may also be regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our proposed products may be manufactured, distributed and sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of prescription drugs, such as those that we intend to distribute. FDA regulations require us and our suppliers to meet relevant cGMP regulations for the preparation, packing, labeling, and storage of all drugs.
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulation, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, submitting periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, manufacturing or labeling changes, record-keeping requirements, and compliance with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for GMP compliance, imposing procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with these regulations could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, suspension of production or injunctions, seizures, or civil or criminal sanctions. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future subcontractors will be able to comply with these regulations.
 
The FDA regulates prescription drug labeling and promotion activities. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses. The FDA permits the promotion of drugs for unapproved uses in certain circumstances, subject to stringent requirements. We and our product candidates are subject to a variety of state laws and regulations which may hinder our ability to market our products. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval by foreign regulatory authorities must be obtained prior to commencing clinical trials, and sales and marketing efforts in those countries. These approval procedures vary in complexity from country to country, and the processes may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future.
 
The FDA, comparable foreign regulators and state and local pharmacy regulators impose substantial requirements upon clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These and other entities regulate research and development and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products. The drug approval process required by the FDA under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally involves:
 

· | preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | submission of an IND, prior to commencing human clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; and
--+--------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA.
--+------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. In some cases, long-term preclinical studies are conducted concurrently with clinical studies.
 
We will submit the preclinical test results, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we begin human clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after filing, unless the FDA raises questions about conduct of the trials outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold, in which case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve the matters before clinical trials can begin. It is possible that our submission may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials must be supervised by qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations, which include informed consent requirements. Each study must be approved and monitored by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) which are periodically informed of the study’s progress, adverse events and changes in research. Annual updates are submitted to the FDA and more frequently if certain serious adverse events occur.
 
Human clinical trials of drug candidates typically have three sequential phases that may overlap:
 
Phase 1:   The drug is initially tested in healthy human subjects or patients for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion.
 
Phase 2:   The drug is studied in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, determine efficacy for specific diseases and establish dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 
Phase 3:   When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range is effective with an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety, are undertaken in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed sites.
 
We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or the IND sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we also must prepare, within 60 days of an End of Phase 2 meeting, a pediatric study plan or request for waiver or deferral of pediatric studies in the indication under development. Concurrent with these trials and studies, we also develop chemistry and physical characteristics data and finalize a manufacturing process in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must conform to consistency and quality standards, and we must develop methods for testing the quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Appropriate packaging is selected and tested, and chemistry stability studies are conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. Results of the foregoing are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA (or BLA in case of biologic products) for marketing and commercial shipment approval. The FDA reviews each NDA or BLA submitted and may request additional information. A 60-day period after the sponsor’s submission of an NDA or BLA is used by the FDA to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, in which case the application is accepted for filing.
 
Once the FDA accepts the NDA or BLA for filing, it begins its in-depth review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted or identify new concerns. The process may be significantly extended by requests for new information or clarification of information already submitted. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Manufacturing establishments often are inspected prior to NDA or BLA approval to assure compliance with GMPs and with manufacturing commitments made in the application.
 
Submission of an NDA or BLA with clinical data requires payment of a substantial fee. In return, the FDA assigns a goal for review and decision on the application, in which the FDA may approve or deny the NDA or BLA, or issue a complete response letter outlining information needed to support approval, including a potential need for additional clinical data. Even if these data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the NDA or BLA does not satisfy approval criteria. If the FDA approves the NDA or BLA, the product becomes available for marketing. Product approval may be withdrawn if regulatory compliance is not maintained or safety problems occur. The FDA may require post-marketing studies, also known as Phase 4 studies, as a condition of approval, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized. The agency has the power to require changes in labeling or prohibit further marketing based on the results of post-marketing surveillance.

Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses.
 
Even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
The FDA’s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products. Increased attention to the containment of health care costs worldwide could result in new government regulations materially adverse to our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
Orphan Drug Act
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted anti-kickback statues and false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to the delivery of or payments for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA and its implementing regulations also established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.
 
Because of the breadth of these and other laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Competitive Environment
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multi-national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies developing both generic and proprietary therapies to treat serious diseases. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, human, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the therapeutic areas we are currently pursuing. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for the prevention and treatment of C. difficile infection include: Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Artugen Therapeutics, Inc., AzurRx, Inc., Da Volterra, Deinove, Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co. Inc., Merus B.V., Pfizer Inc., Rebiotix, Inc., Seres Therapeutics, Inc., Summit Therapeutics plc. and Vedanata Biosciences Inc. Companies that sell or are developing products for the treatment or prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) include: Amgen, Inc., Astellas Pharma, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Inc. Roche AG and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.

Academic research centers, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being developed by us. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us.
Corporate History
 
Our predecessor, Sheffield Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was incorporated in 1986, and in 2006 engaged in a reverse merger with Pipex Therapeutics, Inc., a publicly-traded Delaware corporation formed in 2001. After the merger, we changed our name to Pipex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in October 2008 we changed our name to Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On October 15, 2009, we engaged in a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of reincorporating in the State of Nevada. On February 15, 2012, we changed our name to Synthetic Biologics, Inc. On August 10, 2018, we effected a one for thirty-five reverse stock split of our authorized, issued and outstanding common stock.
 
Human Capital-Employees
 
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. As of March 3, 2021, we employed 10 individuals, all of whom are full-time employees, of which 5 were part of our research and clinical development team and 5 were part of our financial reporting and accounting team. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management considers relations with our employees to be in good standing. Although we continually seek to add additional talent to our work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
 
Competitive Pay and Benefits
 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

• | we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, and unpaid parental leave.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Safety
 
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include:

• | adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------


• | adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
