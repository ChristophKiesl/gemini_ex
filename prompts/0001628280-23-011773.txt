Item 1. Business
Company Overview
We are a vertically integrated space company that provides customers dedicated and rideshare small-satellite launch capabilities. Our philosophy is to operate a mobile launch system that can launch “at any time, to any orbit, without warning.” Our vision is to use space to drive positive and lasting change on Earth, from connecting communities to advancing scientific initiatives; supporting America’s and other nations’ space presence, supporting the global space operations that enhance the way joint and coalition forces fight, and helping create the next generation of world-changing space technology.
Since our founding in 2017, we have invested in research and development efforts to develop a unique air-launch system, comprised of Cosmic Girl, a modified Boeing 747 aircraft, and the LauncherOne rocket. Cosmic Girl serves as a reusable mobile launch pad, carrying LauncherOne aloft, a two-stage rocket that is the world’s first and only liquid-fueled, air-launched rocket to reach orbit successfully. This mobile system allows us to serve a broad array of applications and end markets, providing customers with a highly differentiated solution to launch satellites relative to other existing small-satellite ground launch providers.
We believe there is near- and medium-term acceleration in the growth of the space market, driven by rapid advances in launch and satellite technology. As a result, there has been a proliferation of private sector space companies pursuing the growing demand for space solutions across multiple applications. There are numerous private small-satellite launch companies (focused on developing rockets to carry satellites of less than 1,000 kg to 500 km low Earth orbit), but to our knowledge, only five small-satellite launch providers in the U.S. have successfully delivered launch payloads to their intended orbits — Astra Space, Northrop Grumman, Rocket Lab, SpaceX, and Virgin Orbit. As one of the few proven small-satellite launch providers, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these attractive industry tailwinds. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have successfully completed a total of four orbital launches since 2021. Although our latest launch attempt in January 2023 from Spaceport Cornwall, U.K. did not reach orbit, we believe that our successful launches demonstrate the efficacy of our launch system. With four completed orbital launches, we have delivered 33 satellites to their desired orbits with high precision. The Company intends to conduct future commercial launches from other locations.
By utilizing an air-launch system via Cosmic Girl and the LauncherOne rocket, we believe that we offer the agility, flexibility and responsiveness that small-satellite customers need to achieve their mission objectives. Our launches have delivered satellites to orbit for customers across commercial, civil and national security and defense markets, both domestically and internationally. Leveraging the successes from these launches, we have been able to secure approximately $192.1 million of binding agreements as of December 31, 2022.
We develop and manufacture our launch technology from a vertically-integrated manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California. We leverage advanced, state-of-the art manufacturing capabilities, including automation and additive manufacturing technologies. 
Our diverse portfolio is organized across three core offerings:
•Commercial & Civil: We provide dedicated and rideshare launch services for commercial and civil customers, both from the United States and internationally. This offering also includes civil spaceports, where a foreign nation can buy or lease our mobile launch system ground equipment, aircraft and launch system to provide in-country launch capabilities, allowing these countries to become spacefaring through existing airport infrastructure.
•National Security and Defense: We provide national security launch and mission services to the U.S. and its allied Government customers, including the Space Force, Air Force and other agencies within the U.S. Department of Defense (the “DoD”) and the intelligence community. We also intend to offer government squadron services wherein the entire air-launch system will be a program of record sold to government customers who will own and operate the system directly, providing enhanced flexibility and responsiveness. Additionally, due to the distinct features of LauncherOne, which is itself a hypersonic system, we can also provide solutions for missile defense target applications and other key hypersonic research and development and demonstration activities.
•Space Solutions: Leveraging existing launch capabilities and our track record as a systems integrator, our plan is to provide end-to-end value-added services for Internet of Things (“IoT”) and discrete and integrated Earth Observation (“EO”) applications through the combination of agreements with satellite operators and a satellite

constellation we will own and operate. Using a satellite-as-a-service model, we expect to deploy our own satellites in the next few years to serve government and commercial customers, both domestically and internationally.
Recent Developments 
Voluntary Petitions for Bankruptcy
On April 4, 2023 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and our domestic subsidiaries, Virgin Orbit National Systems, LLC, Vieco USA, Inc., Virgin Orbit, LLC and JACM Holdings, Inc. (together with the Company, the “Debtors”), commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Chapter 11 proceedings are jointly administered under the caption In re Virgin Orbit Holdings, Inc., et al. (Case No. 23-10405) (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). The Debtors continue to operate their business as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. On April 5, 2023, the Debtors received interim approval of a variety of “first day” motions containing customary relief intended to assure the Debtors’ ability to continue their ordinary course operations.
For the duration of the of the Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to significant risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings. As a result of these significant risks and uncertainties, our results of operations and management could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the description of our operations, properties and business and capital plans included in this Annual Report and the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 proceedings.
Delisting of Common Stock and Warrants from Nasdaq
On April 4, 2023, we received a notification from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notifying us of Nasdaq’s intention to delist the Company’s common stock and warrants as a result of the Company’s filing of a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and that trading of the Company’s securities would be suspended effective at the opening of business on April 13, 2023. The Company has requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel to appeal Nasdaq’s determination to delist the Company’s securities. Trading of the Company’s securities will remain suspended pending the appeal process. Nasdaq will not take any action to delist the Company’s securities pending a final written decision by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. There can be no assurance that our appeal will be successful. 
Operational Pause and Workforce Reduction 
Following an operational pause beginning on March 16, 2023, which we implemented in order to conserve capital while we explored potential fundraising transactions, on March 30, 2023, we announced a workforce reduction of approximately 675 employees, constituting approximately 85% of our workforce in order to reduce expenses in light of our inability to secure meaningful funding. Employees in all areas of the Company were impacted by the workforce reduction, which was substantially complete by April 3, 2023.
Current Operations
With our reduced workforce, we intend to conduct reduced rate operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. We expect these operations will include continuing the final assembly and integration testing of the launch vehicle for our next launch, which is more than approximately 90% complete. If we are able to effectuate a successful restructuring or sale of our business through the Chapter 11 Cases, and subject to that timing, we would seek to conduct our next launch before the end of 2023, with a customer that is currently on contract for that launch. In addition, if we continue operations following the Chapter 11 Cases and assuming adequate capital resources, we would intend to increase our work force from the current level of approximately 100 employees to approximately 275 employees by the end of 2023. Thereafter in 2024, we would seek to increase our launch rate.
Industry Overview
We operate within the large and growing space economy, with the total addressable market for Virgin Orbit’s services expected to be $86.5 billion by 2030. This rapid growth is being driven by various factors, the most significant being the reduced costs for both launch and satellite manufacturing due to technological advancements. As a result, space solutions have proliferated across multiple end markets, including communications, maritime, logistics, and importantly, national security and defense.
Table of Contents

Over the last decade, space technology has advanced on multiple fronts, including increases in satellite bandwidth and throughput, which allows for high-rate data transfer, utilization of consumer electronics and integrated circuit advancements allowing for miniaturization of satellite components, which reduces satellite developmental costs, and increases overall system efficiencies and expanded reach and global coverage from satellites in LEO. The private sector has played a meaningful role in the evolution of space technology, whereas historically innovation was almost entirely government-driven.
Space is viewed as crucial to national security and defense, as nations rely on space solutions for critical communications, precise location information, navigation capabilities and broader global monitoring. The U.S. Government and its allies are focused on maintaining and evolving space capabilities, while also thwarting anti-satellite rocket technologies that are being developed and tested by adversaries. 
Our Products & Services Overview
We have a diverse portfolio of space offerings, spanning various end markets and applications. Our portfolio is organized into three main offerings, each leveraging our underlying launch technology and core capabilities.
Commercial & Civil
•Commercial & Civil Launch: Caters to the launch demands of commercial and civil customers both in the United States and international markets, including customers such as Arqit Ltd. (“Arqit”) and SatRev, S.A. (“SatRev”), and civil customers, such as NASA. We offer these customers dedicated, primary or secondary rideshare satellite launch services to any orbit with both timing and launch location flexibility given the mobility and responsiveness of our system. A dedicated launch is one in which the customer buys the entire launch payload (mass & volume). In a rideshare launch, there are several payload customers, including a primary rideshare customer (who determines the mission parameters) and secondary rideshare customer(s) whose payloads utilize the remaining mass and volume capacity not utilized by the primary. Dedicated and primary rideshare customers can inject their payloads directly into their desired orbits without the time loss associated with traveling from one orbit to another, thereby providing them the option to achieve an earlier revenue stream. Moreover, the architecture of the air-launch system is designed for a more reliable and agile launch cadence than the traditional ground-launch rideshare system adopted by many of our competitors such as SpaceX or Rocket Lab. The responsiveness of our system is also critical for supporting the operation and maintenance of satellite constellations in instances where a satellite malfunctions and needs urgent replacement.
•Civil Spaceports: The unique modularity of the LauncherOne system permits launches from any government licensed horizontal spaceport with a runway long enough to support a Boeing 747-400 aircraft. We leverage fully transportable GSE (ground-support equipment required for our launch operations) to eliminate the need for extensive infrastructure investments traditionally associated with ground launch applications. We are also in the process of bringing flexible launch for small-satellites to a global network of spaceports and countries across the world. We have conducted launch operations from Spaceport Cornwall at Cornwall Airport Newquay (NQY) in the U.K. and are currently seeking to commence launch operations at other locations, such as Oita Airport (OIT) in Japan and spaceports in Brazil and Australia, in the coming years. We are also in discussions with various other countries on the prospects of leveraging their existing aircraft runway infrastructure to adopt our spaceport product offering and develop in-country launch capabilities.
National Security
•National Security Launch and Squadron Services: Provides launch services for national security and defense customers such as the U.S. Government and its allies. We believe our launch system is particularly attractive to these customers because of its capability for anonymity; our ability to fly Cosmic Girl to, and launch from, different locations makes it difficult for our adversaries to predict timing and location of launch, as compared with a static ground-based launch pad, making it highly attractive for National Security customers that prioritize operation covertness. Moreover, the resiliency and responsiveness of the system is especially important should there be a need to replace critical satellites that go out of operation. We believe that our squadron services offering, in which we expect to deliver turnkey capability through the sale of equipment as well as services to the U.S. Government, is of increased interest as it facilitates the necessary capabilities for the Space Force to responsively and independently deploy appropriate assets against the U.S. Government’s adversaries, a previously non-existent capability.
Table of Contents

•Missile Defense Targets and Hypersonic Applications: Hypersonics (high-speed systems or devices that travel at speeds over Mach 5) are a growing area of focus for the DoD, especially as several foreign nations race to build military capabilities in this area for offensive purposes. With our system’s ability to achieve hypersonic speeds and our deep connectivity within the DoD, we believe we are well-positioned to support and complement the various Hypersonic Training, Testing and Exercising (“TT&E”) activities and develop advanced defense mechanisms for the U.S. Government. As missile defense is a core part of the U.S. defense strategy, we believe LauncherOne is able to serve as a cost-effective alternative to expensive targets that are currently in use for research and development efforts by the Missile Defense Agency (“MDA”). We have an on-going contract with MDA to demonstrate the utility of LauncherOne for MDA target applications.
Space Solutions
•IoT Solutions: This solution seeks to provide end-to-end value-added services for the smart mobility and smart logistics sectors of the IoT market. Key areas of focus include:
◦Connected ship management: expected to track and monitor shipping assets across the globe in real-time and provide improved connectivity at sea;
◦Connected aircraft management: expected to track and monitor aircraft across the globe in real-time and provide improved connectivity in air;
◦Pipeline monitoring: expected to monitor pipeline status and potential leaks in real-time providing customers the opportunity to mitigate losses by proactively addressing issues in the system; and
◦Smart agriculture: expected to track and monitor weather and soil data for precision farming applications.
•EO Solutions: This solution seeks to develop multi-modal imaging offerings in an integrated suite including data collection methodologies such as Synthetic Aperture Radar, operational electronic intelligence, infrared-hyperspectral and electro-optical imagery techniques. We believe applications for this offering include maritime domain awareness, public safety, insurance, agriculture, mining, oil and gas.
Our Launch System
Through years of research and development, we have in place a proprietary system that enables us to provide key launch capabilities. This is comprised of:
•Cosmic Girl: Cosmic Girl is a modified Boeing 747-400 aircraft that serves as a reusable mobile launch platform. This allows our launch system to be fully mobile and to launch payloads into orbit with an unprecedented level of flexibility. The interior of the aircraft has been modified to support minimal maintenance requirements and the upper deck has been outfitted to support onboard launch operations with just two pilots and two launch engineers. One of the most important modifications is the pylon, which is used to carry the LauncherOne rocket up to approximately 35,000 feet where it is released for launch. Using Cosmic Girl as an aerial launch platform enables our rocket to be more efficient, benefiting from the initial altitude (35,000 feet), speed (approximately 85% of the speed of sound at launch) and aerodynamics (air density approximately 30% of sea level) as compared with a typical ground launch. We expect our future research and development efforts in this area will include the modification of a cargo Boeing 747 aircraft that would be a fully transportable, self-contained launch system that can carry the rocket, payloads and GSE to anywhere in the world.
•LauncherOne: LauncherOne is a two-stage rocket used to launch satellites into orbit. It is the world’s first and only liquid-fueled, air-launched rocket to reach orbit successfully. It is engineered for optimal performance in conjunction with Cosmic Girl and has the lowest launch cost per kilogram among small rocket ground launchers. The rocket, designed for simplicity, has an all-carbon composite design with liner-less tanks, thereby increasing system reliability and increasing production efficiency. With its one engine per stage design, the system has enhanced resilience. Our nearest competitor, Rocket Lab, has 11 engines versus our two. This is a key advantage for our system since engines have the highest risk of failure in a rocket. Our on-board autonomous range safety systems further enhance system reliability and eliminates the need for extensive ground safety infrastructure. LauncherOne is designed to carry payloads of up to approximately 300 kilograms, with expected future versions allowing for potential payloads of up to 500 kilograms.

Our Growth Strategy
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases will consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. Our business could also suffer from a long and protracted restructuring. All of these factors could limit our ability to pursue growth strategies for our business in the near- to mid-term.
Customers
Through our four successful launches, we have been able to cater to domestic and international customers from each of our core focus sectors including: NASA, International Ministries of Defense (“MoDs”), U.S. DoD, U.S. intelligence community, and Commercial international constellation providers. Our commercial customers include satellite and constellation providers such as Arqit and SatRev. Our civil customers mostly fall within our spaceport offering and our launch offerings for civil space agencies, including NASA. We have also previously announced plans to launch from several spaceports.
Outside of spaceports, we provide dedicated launch services for space agencies. To-date, we have established a track record of successful launches for NASA and if we resume full-scale operations, we intend to expand to other national civil space agencies, particularly with governments that have space agencies but lack their own infrastructure for domestic space launch. We have also established relationships, deployed satellites, and have on-going contracts with numerous customers in the national security and defense sector, including the Space Force, the U.S. Air Force, the National Reconnaissance Office (“NRO”) and the MDA. Our current customer pipeline includes parties that have signed binding Launch Service Agreements (“LSAs”) or nonbinding MOUs and LOIs, or with whom there are proposals and contracts under negotiation with an internally calculated high probability of win (“Pwin”) rate. This pipeline has a broad range of domestic and international customers, including government and commercial entities. We are not dependent on any major customer or customers given our current diverse customer pipeline. However, there is no assurance that these customers will not make arrangements to launch with other providers given our current financial situation.
Sales & Marketing
If we resume full-scale operations, we will have to rebuild our sales and marketing team, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting and retaining professionals with relevant experience and relationships in our industry.
Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch Operations
Virgin Orbit is headquartered in Long Beach, CA, having a combined facility space of 195,000 square feet. The main building (Conant) is 151,000 square feet and houses office space and a large manufacturing floor and our second building (McGowen) is 44,000 square feet and houses training, customer experience, offices, payload processing and additional manufacturing space. Since moving in to the Long Beach facilities, we have invested significantly in our production facilities. The vast majority of our design, engineering, manufacturing, integration, assembly and test activities occur in our main building. The LauncherOne production and assembly line features state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and custom-built test rigs. Our automated composites fabrication process enables us to build rocket tanks in days versus months. We also have a relationship with DMG MORI that allows us to leverage their advanced manufacturing technology helping reduce cycle time by up to 10 times for key components. Our operations are highly integrated, with over 80% of each rocket built in-house. As of date of this 10-K, there are five rockets in production and our facility has the tooling, processes and technology to support a production capacity up to 20 rockets annually. The factory is highly scalable with easy expansion of production capabilities through floor space addition and optimization and additional copies of key tooling.
Our McGowen building is located near our headquarters in Long Beach and houses our payload processing facility where our customers’ payloads are encapsulated after spacecraft receipt, inspection and testing are completed. The Virgin Orbit team conducts high-energy testing near the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, where there are multiple custom-built test stands for liquid propulsion, composite tank, component, and overall stage testing. Acceptance testing for LauncherOne’s Newton family of engines occurs at our horizontal test stands, and stage tests are performed on vertical test stands.
Supply Chain
Our ability to manufacture and operate our rockets is dependent upon sufficient availability of raw materials and supplied components, including RP-1 (which is our rocket fuel) and hydrogen, helium, liquid oxygen and nitrogen, which are the gases used in our rockets.
Table of Contents

We aim to obtain raw materials and components from reputable and reliable suppliers, following established internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. While we largely source raw materials and components from multiple sources, in some cases raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. In these situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this risk through using material requirements planning, including material forecasting and planning, safety stock, and bulk and advance buying with focused efforts on long-lead items.
Competition
Our main competitors fall into four categories:
•Established air-launch providers, with proof of delivering payloads into orbit, of which there is one known operational competitor, Northrop Grumman;
•Established vertical ground launch providers, with proof of delivering payloads into orbit, including SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, International Launch Services and Rocket Lab, as well as foreign space agencies such as Arianespace, Roscosmos (GK Launch Services), ISC Kosmotras, the Indian Space Research Organisation’s PSLV, Japan’s H-2 and H-3, the European Space Agency’s Vega and Astra Space, Inc. (which is currently on launch hiatus as it evaluates its business).
•Companies that are reported to have plans to provide launch vehicles that are capable of regularly delivering payloads into orbit, but that have not deployed an operational-payload to the intended orbit or launched successfully, including ABL, Relativity Space, Firefly Aerospace, Southern Launch and LandSpace; and
•Space solutions providers offering combined IoT and EO services, as well as a range of on-orbit services, such as BlackSky, Spire, Planet Labs, StarLink, OneWeb, Capella and China Spacesat.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully as a commercial provider of satellite launch services does and will depend on a number of factors, including:
•Flight track record, reliability and simplicity of launches;
•Launch technical performance;
•Responsiveness and ability to launch on demand;
•Environmental responsibility and reusability of the system;
•Ability to quickly grow market share and scale;
•Customer experience; and
•Price competitiveness and advantage.
We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as through contractual protections with our customers and nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees, and we seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our supplier and business partners. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, and we will pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.
Trademark License Agreement and Debrand Agreement
Under a Trade Mark License Agreement (the “TMLA”) between Virgin Orbit and Virgin Enterprises Limited (“VEL”), an entity affiliated with Virgin Investments Limited (“VIL” or “Parent Company”), we had certain exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use the name and brand “Virgin Orbit” and the Virgin signature logo, subject to certain reserved rights and pre-existing licenses granted by VEL to third parties, in consideration of our payment of quarterly royalties to VEL. In addition, for the term of the TMLA, to the extent the Virgin Group did not otherwise have a right to place a director on the Board, such as the right of VIL to designate directors to the Board under the Stockholders’ Agreement, under the TMLA, 
Table of Contents

we agreed to provide VEL with the right to appoint one director to the Board (provided the designee is qualified to serve on the Board under all applicable corporate governance policies and regulatory and Nasdaq requirements).
The TMLA also contained, among other things, customary indemnification provisions in favor of VEL, representations and warranties made by us, information rights of VEL and restrictions on our and our affiliates’ ability to apply for or obtain registration for any intellectual property similar to that licensed to us pursuant to the TMLA. Furthermore, VEL is generally responsible for the protection, maintenance and enforcement of the licensed intellectual property, including the Virgin brand.
On April 2, 2023, in connection with the Company’s entry into the DIP Credit Agreement with VIL, we entered into a Termination and Debrand Agreement (the “Debrand Agreement”) with VEL, pursuant to which the TMLA was terminated as of April 2, 2023 (the “Termination Date”). Following the Termination Date, all rights licensed under the TMLA in relation to the use of the Marks (as defined in the TMLA) will, subject to agreed run-off periods contemplated in the Debrand Agreement and in the Debranding Plan (as defined in the Debrand Agreement), immediately and permanently revert to VEL. Pursuant to the Debrand Agreement, we agreed with VEL to, as soon as possible after the Termination Date, carry out a Debranding Plan with respect to the marks, rights and other matters subject to the TMLA. We are not required to change our corporate name, and are permitted to use such marks and rights, until the earlier of the closing of a sale of the Company or the effective date of a Chapter 11 plan.
Human Capital Management
On March 16, 2023, we implemented an operational pause in order to conserve capital while we explored potential fundraising transactions. As a result of our inability to secure meaningful funding during that time, on March 30, 2023, we announced a workforce reduction of approximately 675 employees, constituting approximately 85% of our workforce in order to reduce expenses. Employees in all areas of the Company were impacted by the workforce reduction, which was substantially complete by April 3, 2023. Following the workforce reduction, as of April 5, 2023, we have 97 full-time employees and 2 contractors.
To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes. Our employees are not subject to collective bargaining agreements.
We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to address the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including access to excellent healthcare choices, opportunities for career growth and development, and resources to support their financial health.
We are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an open culture and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we communicate information to our employees about the Company through multiple internal channels.
We are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of what we do and we are committed to growing a workforce that is representative of the customers we serve and community in which we operate.
We have created Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) focusing on veteran status, family & parental support, women empowerment, race & ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation, and more, to see that the needs and opinions of our employees are heard and addressed. In 2022, four new ERGs were created, resulting in a total of seven across the company, encouraging all of our entire employee population to be members of an ERG.
We select our partners and staffing carefully, with expectations of all parties involved in our supply chain to ensure a safe and ethical work environment for all. We continually make improvements to our policies and procedures to promote a respectful and positive working environment for everyone — employees, suppliers and temporary staff alike.
We have established goals to increase the number of employees from underrepresented groups to help achieve, at a minimum, industry average representation across these groups. At least twice each year we review base compensation across objective factors (including level, years of experience, education and performance) to maintain a constant focus on lessening and closing any pay gaps, especially focused on women and people of color.
We comply with the new Pay Transparency Law in the state of California, choosing to include this transparency across all work locations, whether required by that state or not. The law provides that reasonable pay ranges are posted on every requisition, and employees may request the reasonable range for their current position as well. This transparency is also expected to drive increased pay equity, promoting an open and honest conversation about pay, qualifications and skills and equal treatment for all internal employees and candidates.

Governmental Regulation
Federal Aviation Administration
The regulations, policies and guidance issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) apply to the use and operation of the LauncherOne system. Once a notification of intent to launch is transmitted to FAA, the FAA’s commercial space transportation requirements apply. Operators of launch vehicles are required to have proper licenses, permits and authorizations from the FAA and comply with the FAA’s insurance requirements for third-party liability and government property. While Cosmic Girl is currently registered with the FAA, in the event of a change in ownership, the FAA license will be updated with current information. In that instance, once any such new vehicle registration applications are filed, the applications will serve as registrations until the FAA issues the new vehicle registrations, which will allow operations to continue during that period.
When not operating in a launch mode (Cosmic Girl and a fully-loaded LauncherOne), Cosmic Girl is regulated under an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate by the FAA. The FAA is responsible for the regulation and oversight of matters relating to experimental aircraft, the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA aircraft certification and maintenance, and other matters affecting air safety and operations.
Failure to comply with the FAA’s aviation or space transportation regulations may result in civil penalties or private lawsuits, or the suspension or revocation of licenses or permits, which would prevent operating the LauncherOne system. Internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country.
Informed Consent and Waiver
Commercial spaceflight operations and any third-party claims that arise from operation of spaceflights are subject to federal laws governing informed consents and waivers of claims.
Our launch system utilizes pilots and launch engineers on Cosmic Girl during a launch operation. Per federal regulation 14 CFR §460.9, Virgin Orbit is required to have all flight crew members (pilots and launch engineers) sign an informed consent stating that “The United States Government has not certified the launch vehicle and any reentry vehicle as safe for carrying flight crew or space flight participants.” Virgin Orbit holds these consent forms and transmits them to FAA-AST.
Per federal regulation 14 CFR §440 Appendix B, Virgin Orbit is also required to obtain a Waiver of Claims from the payload provider and U.S. Government. This form will waive and release claims between Virgin Orbit, the payload provider, and the U.S. Government. All operators with an FAA-license for commercial launches and reentries are covered by this federal indemnification and are required to carry insurance in amounts up to the maximum probable loss level likely to occur in an accident subject to a cap. In the instance of a catastrophic loss, U.S. law provides that the federal government will pay up to $3.0 billion to indemnify the operator above the maximum probable loss level.
International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Controls
Our launch services business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”) and the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”). The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.
The U.S. Government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. Government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime with respect to the spaceflight business.
Many different types of internal controls and efforts are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain a registration under the ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. Government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance of services for foreign persons, related to and that support our launch services business. The authorization requirements include the need to get permission to release controlled technology to foreign person employees and other foreign persons. The inability to secure and maintain necessary licenses and other authorizations could negatively affect our ability to compete successfully or to operate our launch services business as 
Table of Contents

planned. Any changes in the export control regulations or U.S. Government licensing policy, such as that necessary to implement U.S. Government commitments to multilateral control regimes, may restrict our operations.
Failures by us to comply with export control laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, more onerous compliance requirements, loss of export privileges, debarment from government contracts, or limitations on our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to various Environmental, Health and Safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations, including but not limited to laws and regulations relating to air emissions, water use and discharge, waste management, wildlife and natural resource protection, and workplace safety. While compliance costs for such laws has not historically been material, there can be no guarantee that this will continue in future. For more information, see our risk factor titled “We are subject to environmental regulation and may incur substantial costs.”
Corporate Information and Development
We were initially formed on January 11, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company (“NextGen”) and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. From the time of our formation to the time of the Closing, our name was “NextGen Acquisition Corp. II”.
On August 22, 2021, we entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Pulsar Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of NextGen (“Merger Sub”), and Vieco USA, Inc. (“Vieco USA”). On December 29, 2021, the date on which Virgin Orbit consummated the transaction that resulted in its business becoming a public company (the “Closing”), as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and following approval by our shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held December 28, 2021:
•we filed a notice of deregistration with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies, together with the necessary accompanying documents, and filed a certificate of incorporation and a certificate of corporate domestication with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, under which NextGen was domesticated and continues as a Delaware corporation, changing its name to “Virgin Orbit Holdings, Inc.” (the “Domestication”);
•all outstanding shares of Vieco USA common stock as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, and, together with shares of Vieco USA common stock reserved in respect of options to purchase shares of Vieco USA common stock (the “Vieco USA Options”) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (exclusive of any Vieco USA Options that have an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the per share merger consideration of $12.50, which were cancelled without consideration) that were converted into awards based on our common stock, were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, or the reservation of, an aggregate of 310,000,000 shares of common stock (at a deemed value of $10.00 per share), which, in the case of Vieco USA Options, were shares underlying awards based on common stock, representing a fully-diluted pre-transaction equity value of Vieco USA of $3.1 billion; and
•Merger Sub was merged with and into Vieco USA, with Vieco USA surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Business Combination” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”).
In connection with the Business Combination:
•each of the then issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of NextGen (“Class A ordinary shares”) converted automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Virgin Orbit (the “common stock”);
•each of the then issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of NextGen (“Class B ordinary shares”) converted automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of common stock;
•each then issued and outstanding warrant of NextGen converted automatically into a warrant to acquire one share of common stock, pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated as of March 22, 2021, between NextGen and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Warrant Agreement”); and
•each of the then issued and outstanding units of NextGen that had not been previously separated into the underlying Class A ordinary shares and underlying warrants upon the request of the holder thereof (the “units”) were cancelled and entitled the holder thereof to one share of common stock and one-fifth of one warrant. No fractional warrants were issued upon separation of the units.
