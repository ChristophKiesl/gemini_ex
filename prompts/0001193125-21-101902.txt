FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, continue, target and words of similar meaning.

 Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 will continue to adversely impact a broad range of industries in which our customers operate and impair their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic indicating that almost all public commerce and related business activities must be, to varying degrees, curtailed with the goal of decreasing the rate of new infections. 
 Notwithstanding any actions by national, state and local governments to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or by us to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing activities will be successful in mitigating or preventing significant adverse effects on our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. 
 Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions designed to cushion the economic fallout. Most notably, the CARES Act was signed into law at the end of March 2020 as a $2 trillion legislative package. The goal of the CARES Act is to prevent a severe economic downturn through various measures, including direct financial aid to American families and economic stimulus to significantly impacted industry sectors. The package also includes extensive emergency funding for hospitals and providers. In addition to the general impact of COVID-19, certain provisions of the CARES Act as well as other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts are expected to continue to have a material impact on our operations. On December 27, 2020, the Relief Act became law and provided an additional $284 billion for the PPP, as well as extending the PPP through March 31, 2021. While it is not possible to know the full universe or extent of these impacts as of the date of this filing, we are disclosing potentially material items of which we are aware. 
 The provisions of the CARES Act included an election to not apply the guidance on accounting for troubled debt restructurings to loan modifications, such as extensions or deferrals, related to COVID-19 made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (i) December 31, 2020 or (ii) 60 days after the end of the COVID-19 national emergency. The relief can only be applied to modifications for loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019. We elected to adopt these provisions of the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2020, we had deferrals of $308,000 in interest, escrow and principal payments on $14.1 million in outstanding loans. 
 The CARES Act authorized the SBA to temporarily guarantee loans under a new loan program called the PPP. As a qualified SBA lender, we were automatically authorized to originate PPP loans. We actively participated in assisting our customers with applications for resources through the program until its closing on August 8, 2020. PPP loans originated

  by us have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0%, (b) two-year and five-year loan terms to maturity; and (c) principal and interest payments deferred for ten months after the end date of the borrowers forgiveness period. The SBA will guarantee 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. Up to the entire principal amount of the borrowers PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount calculated under the PPP. As of December 31, 2020, we have funded 246 PPP loans totaling $17.2 million. 
 Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. See Risk Factors. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake, and we specifically disclaim any obligation, to release publicly the results of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 
 BUSINESS OF 1895 BANCORP OF WISCONSIN, INC. 
 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. was incorporated under federal law on January 8, 2019 as part of the mutual holding company reorganization of PyraMax Bank, for the purpose of becoming the savings and loan holding company of PyraMax Bank. The Company completed its stock offering in connection with the mutual holding company reorganization of PyraMax Bank on January 8, 2019. The Company sold 2,145,738 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in its subscription offering for gross proceeds of approximately $21.5 million, including 175,528 shares purchased by the Banks employee stock ownership plan. In connection with the reorganization, the Company also issued 48,767 shares of common stock to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin Community Foundation, Inc. and 2,682,172 shares of common stock to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC, the federally-chartered mutual holding company. Shares of the Companys common stock began trading on January 9, 2019 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol BCOW. 
 The Company is authorized to pursue business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations, which may include the acquisition of banking and financial services companies. See Supervision and Regulation  Holding Company Regulation for a discussion of the activities that are permitted for savings and loan holding companies. We currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other financial institutions, although we may determine to do so in the future. We may also borrow funds for reinvestment in PyraMax Bank. 
 Our cash flow depends on earnings from the investment of the net proceeds we retained from our initial public stock offering that was consummated in January 2019, and any dividends we receive from PyraMax Bank. We neither own nor lease any property, but pay a fee to PyraMax Bank for the use of its premises, equipment and furniture. At the present time, we employ only persons who are officers of PyraMax Bank who also serve as officers of the Company. We use the support staff of PyraMax Bank from time to time and pay a fee to PyraMax Bank for the time devoted to the Company by employees of PyraMax Bank. However, these persons are not separately compensated by the Company. The Company may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it expands its business in the future. 
 BUSINESS OF 1895 BANCORP OF WISCONSIN, MHC 
 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC was formed in January 2019 as a federal mutual holding company and will at all times own a majority of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. 
 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHCs principal assets are the common stock of the Company it received in the reorganization and offering and $100,000 cash in initial capitalization, which was contributed by the Company from the net proceeds of the offering. It is expected that the only business activity of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC will be to own a majority of the Companys common stock. 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC will be authorized, however, to engage in any other business activities that are permissible for mutual holding companies under federal law, including investing in loans and securities. 
 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC will neither own nor lease any property, but will instead use the premises, equipment and furniture of PyraMax Bank. It is anticipated that 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC will employ only persons who are officers of PyraMax Bank to serve as officers of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC. Those persons will not be separately compensated by 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC.

 BUSINESS OF PYRAMAX BANK, FSB 
 General 
 PyraMax Bank is a stock savings bank headquartered in Greenfield, Wisconsin. PyraMax Bank was established in 1895 as South Milwaukee Savings and Loan Association and has operated continuously in the Milwaukee metropolitan area since that time. In 1993, the bank changed its name to South Milwaukee Savings Bank, S.A. In May 2000, a merger between South Milwaukee Savings Bank and Mitchell Savings Bank officially formed PyraMax Bank, SSB. The bank changed to a federal savings bank charter in 2003, changing its name to PyraMax Bank, FSB. 
 From our founding in 1895, we operated as a traditional thrift institution, offering primarily residential mortgage loans and savings accounts, supplemented with multi-family and commercial real estate loans. In 2007, Richard Hurd was promoted to Chief Executive Officer and President of PyraMax Bank. Mr. Hurd began shifting PyraMax Banks focus to include more business-oriented products and services. In 2010, PyraMax Bank hired Charles Mauer as its Chief Credit Officer, continuing our increased focus on business-oriented lending. David Ball was hired as President and Chief Operating Officer effective February 2021. In this role he will oversee the daily operations of PyraMax Bank, design and implement business strategies and set comprehensive goals for profitability and growth. Mr. Hurd remains our Chief Executive Officer. 
 We conduct our operations from our three full-service banking offices in Milwaukee County, our two full-service banking offices in Waukesha County and our full-service banking office in Ozaukee County Wisconsin. We sold our branch located at 1605 West Mitchell Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin in January 2019. We also closed our leased branch office located at 318 North Water Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin and our owned branch office at 8001 West National Avenue, West Allis, Wisconsin effective December 31, 2019. We consider our primary lending market area to be Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee Counties, however, we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary lending market, usually to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market. 
 Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans (which includes non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multi-family, owner occupied commercial real estate and one- to four-family non-owner occupied loans), commercial loans (which includes commercial and industrial loans) and consumer loans. Commercial real estate growth has been the primary source of recent loan growth, and commercial business loan originations have also been emphasized. 
 Subject to market conditions, we expect to increase our focus on originating commercial real estate and commercial business loans in an effort to continue to diversify our overall loan portfolio, increase the overall yield earned on our loans and assist in managing interest rate risk. We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises, state and municipal securities, asset-backed securities and corporate collateralized mortgage-backed securities. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. Additionally, we have used borrowings, primarily advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, to fund our operations. 
 Reflecting our focus on our community, in connection with the offering, in 2019, we established a charitable foundation called 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin Community Foundation and funded it with $100,000 in cash and 48,767 shares of our common stock, for an aggregate contribution of $587,670 (based on the $10.00 per share offering price). The purpose of this foundation is to make contributions to support various charitable organizations operating in our community now and in the future. 
 PyraMax Bank has one subsidiary, PyraMax Insurance Services LLC, which offers a comprehensive set of insurance and risk management products for personal and business needs. 
 Our website address is www.pyramaxbank.com. Information on this website should not be considered a part of this report.

 Market Area 
 We conduct our operations from our three full-service banking offices in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin our two full-service banking offices in Waukesha County, Wisconsin and our full-service banking office in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin. We consider our primary lending market area to be southeastern Wisconsin, however, we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary lending market, usually to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market. 
 Milwaukee County contains a diverse cross section of employment sectors, with a mix of services, manufacturing, wholesale/retail trade, federal and local government, health care facilities and finance-related employment. Milwaukee County had an estimated population of 945,726 in 2019, the most recent year for which information is available. 
 Milwaukee County is primarily an urban community and is the fortieth wealthiest county in Wisconsin. Our Milwaukee County banking offices are located in more suburban areas, but are still in proximity to downtown Milwaukee. 
 PyraMax Bank works with the City of Milwaukee and neighborhood housing agencies to support home ownership in all markets in which we operate. 
 Waukesha County is primarily a suburban community and is the wealthiest county in Wisconsin, with a median household income of $87,277 from 2015 to 2019. Waukesha County had an estimated population of 404,198 in 2019. Waukesha County has a diversified economy, including numerous educational institutions and a wide-ranging hospitality industry. 
 Ozaukee County is the second wealthiest county in Wisconsin, with a median household income of $85,215 from 2015 to 2019. Ozaukee County had an estimated population of 89,221 in 2019. Ozaukee Countys economy includes manufacturing, agricultural, healthcare, governmental and trade sectors. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, fintech companies and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. 
 As of June 30, 2020 (the latest date for which information is available), our market share was 0.48% of total deposits in FDIC-insured institutions in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, making us the 16th largest out of 29 banks in Milwaukee County. Our market share was 0.47% of total deposits in FDIC-insured institutions in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, making us the 29th largest out of 34 banks in Waukesha County. Our market share was 1.16% of total deposits in FDIC-insured institutions in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, making us the 13th largest out of 15 banks in Ozaukee County. 
 Lending Activities 
 Our principal lending activity is in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to increase our focus on commercial and commercial real estate loans, in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. We compete by focusing on personalized service for consumers as well as businesses. Due to our structure, we are able to move quickly on client requests and are able to price competitively compared to our competitors. Our responsiveness has enabled us to grow and retain our customer base. Additionally, the Milwaukee market has demonstrated strong growth and diversity in the commercial segment. We believe that our focus on Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee Counties enables us to utilize a limited sales force for maximum results. Our reputation for strong credit underwriting has also allowed us to build a network of smaller banks that purchase participations of loans which exceed our legal lending limit.

 Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate Loans 
 The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans at December 31, 2020 that are due after December 31, 2021 and have either fixed interest rates or floating or adjustable interest rates. The amounts shown below exclude unearned loan origination fees. 

 | Fixed Rates | | Floating or Adjustable Rates | | | Total
 | (Dollars in thousands) | 
Residential real estate loans | $ | 56,442 | | $ | 12,655 | | $ | 69,097 
Commercial loans | | 172,920 | | | 30,152 | | | 203,072
Consumer loans | | 3,029 | | | 11,481 | | | 14,510 
Total | $ | 232,391 | | $ | 54,288 | | $ | 286,679

 As of December 31, 2020, we have extended credit to four customers totaling $8.2 million indexed to the LIBOR. See Risk Factors - Other Risks Related to Our Business - We will be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. 
 One- to four-family Residential Real Estate Lending. At December 31, 2020, we had $69.0 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 20.8% of our total loan portfolio. We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2020, 83.5% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 16.5% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans. 
 Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guidelines when the loan balance meets such guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as conforming loans. We generally originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by Fannie Mae, which as of December 31, 2020 was generally $510,400 for single-family homes in our market area. The maximum conforming loan limits as established by Fannie Mae will increase to $548,250 for the year ended December 31, 2021. We sell, on both a servicing-released and servicing-retained basis, our conforming and eligible jumbo fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as jumbo loans that we may retain in our portfolio. Jumbo loans that we originate typically have 15 to 30 year terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80%. At December 31, 2020, we had $5.8 million in jumbo loans, which represented 8.4% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our average loan size for jumbo loans was approximately $480,000 at December 31, 2020. Generally, all of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in southeastern Wisconsin. 
 We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance may be made in excess of this limit. 
 Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years and generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five years. We also offer initial terms of three or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been tied to a margin above the applicable U.S. Treasury rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period, with a lifetime interest rate cap of generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan and a rate floor. We typically hold in our loan portfolio our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments. 
 
9 


 Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust for up to five years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. 
 We do not offer interest only mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not have a subprime lending program for one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories). 
 Generally, residential mortgage loans that we originate include due-on-sale clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of PyraMax Bank. We also require homeowners insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans. 
 Residential Real Estate Construction Lending. We originate loans to finance the construction of owner occupied one- to four-family residential properties to the prospective homeowners. At December 31, 2020, residential construction loan balances were $3.0 million, or 0.9% of our total loan portfolio, with an additional $5.5 million available to borrowers. The majority of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area. 
 Our owner occupied one- to four-family residential construction loans are generally structured as interest-only for 12 months. Construction loan values for one-to four-family residential properties generally will not exceed 80% during the construction phase of the mortgage, however, if private mortgage insurance is obtained we will consider loan-to-value limits up to 95%. 
 Once the construction project is satisfactorily completed, generally within 12 months, the loan will convert to an amortizing loan for the remaining term of the loan. Upon completion the loan will be evaluated for sale on the secondary market. The interest rate is generally a fixed rate for up to 30 years, or a five- to seven-year adjustable rate mortgage. 
 Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 Commercial Real Estate Lending. Consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yield, we are focused on increasing our origination of commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2020, we had $189.3 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 57.1% of our total loan portfolio. Of this aggregate amount, we had $71.2 million in non-owner occupied non-residential real estate, $65.8 million in multi-family residential real estate, $37.6 million in owner occupied non-residential real estate, $10.2 million in non-owner occupied residential real estate loans, $4.5 million in commercial real estate construction loans. 
 Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by industrial buildings, warehouses, office buildings and other special purpose commercial properties, primarily in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee Counties, Wisconsin. Our multi-family loans, which are classified as commercial real estate loans in the tabular presentation, are generally secured by properties consisting of five or more rental units in our market area. We also purchase and participate in commercial real estate loans from other financial institutions. Such loans are independently underwritten according to our policies. 
 Our commercial real estate loans generally have initial terms of five to ten years and amortization terms of 15 to 30 years, with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term, and may be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans. Our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans are generally tied to a margin above the prime rate or the applicable U.S. Treasury rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan. Generally we require personal guarantees. 
 
10 


 We originate a variety of adjustable-rate multi-family residential real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 30 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every five, seven or 10 years and generally are indexed to the prime rate or the corresponding U.S. Treasury rate, plus a margin. We generally include pre-payment penalties on multi-family residential real estate loans we originate. 
 At December 31, 2020, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was approximately $669,000, and the largest of such loans was a $6.5 million loan consisting of an outstanding balance of $6.5 million secured by a first mortgage on a multi-family residential property. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2020. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrowers experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrowers payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.20x. All commercial real estate loans, with the exception of owner occupied real estate, of $500,000 or more are appraised by outside independent appraisers. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loans. We require property and casualty insurance and flood insurance if the property is determined to be in a flood zone area. 
 In underwriting multi-family and non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, which include the projected net cash flow to the loans debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income level of the borrower and the borrowers experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multi-family residential real estate loans are generally originated in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan, whichever is lower. When circumstances warrant, guarantees are obtained from multi-family and one-to four-family residential real estate customers. In addition, the borrowers and guarantors financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. Multi-family loans may carry additional risk due to eviction moratoriums imposed in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and may lead to a disruption to the cash flow of the property. The vast majority of the tenants occupying our financed multi-family properties continue to pay rent. 
 Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties. If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 We also originate loans to finance the construction of commercial properties, multi-family residential projects (including non-owner occupied one- to four-family residences) and professional complexes. At December 31, 2020, commercial construction loan balances were $4.4 million, or 1.3% of our total loan portfolio. Under these loans, an additional $3.3 million remains available to borrowers. The majority of these loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area.

 Our commercial real estate construction loans are generally structured as interest-only payments during the anticipated construction time. The interest rate is generally fixed for five years at the five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a margin of 1.9% to 2.4%. We generally offer commercial construction loans with a value up to 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loans. 
 Construction loans generally involve greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner occupied real estate. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet approved for the planned development or improvements, there is a risk that necessary approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Risk of loss on a construction loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also carry the risk that construction will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale or rental of the property to third parties, and the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 
 Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. The construction phase is carefully monitored to minimize our risk. All construction projects must be completed in accordance with approved plans and approved by the municipality in which they are located. Loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 Land Development Loans. We originate loans to finance the development of land for agricultural purposes and for the development of commercial and residential properties. Land development loans are generally secured by vacant land and/or property that is in the process of improvement. At December 31, 2020, we had one agricultural loan for $1.5 million, or 0.5% of our total loan portfolio. This loan is secured by a property located in our primary market area. At December 31, 2020, this loan was performing according to its original terms. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loans. 
 Our land development loans may be structured as interest-only loans or amortizing. The interest rate generally floats, at the prime rate or prime rate plus 1%. We offer financing to purchase or refinance land for agricultural purposes or development with a maximum loan to value ratio of 65%. However, if we are providing financing to improve the land, the maximum loan to value ratio will generally be 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less. 
 Land development loans generally involve greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner occupied real estate. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is a risk that necessary approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Risk of loss on a land development loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of development costs is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Land development loans also carry the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties, and the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. 
 Before making a commitment to fund a land development loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We generally monitor the land loan in a similar fashion to our comparable commercial real estate loan.

 Commercial Lending. At December 31, 2020, we had $46.2 million of commercial loans, representing 13.9% of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 included $17.2 million of PPP loans, most of which we expect will be forgiven or paid in 2021. We originate commercial loans and lines of credit secured by non-real estate business assets. These loans are made based primarily on historical and projected cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not behave as forecasted, and collateral securing loans may fluctuate in value because of economic or individual performance factors. Financial information is obtained from the borrowers to evaluate cash flow sufficiency to service debt and is periodically updated during the life of the loan. These loans are generally originated to small businesses in our primary market area. Our commercial loans are generally used by the borrowers for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture, and are primarily secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. Our commercial loans are generally term loans with terms of three to seven years and lines of credit with terms of one to two years, with a target loan size of $250,000 to $5.0 million. Our commercial and industrial lines of credit are generally priced on an adjustable-rate basis tied to the prime rate. Term loans are generally priced at a spread over the applicable U.S. Treasury rate. We generally obtain personal guarantees with commercial loans. 
 At December 31, 2020, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial loans was approximately $133,000, and our largest outstanding commercial and industrial loan commitment totaled $6.7 million in loan facilities to a company whose primary focus is selling forestry and timber related products and replacement parts. The second largest commitment was a loan of $6.5 million to finance a 13-building, 124-unit apartment complex. The third largest commitment was a $6.3 million loan to finance a 135-unit apartment complex. All of these commitments were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2020. 
 We typically originate commercial loans on the basis of the borrowers ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrowers business, the experience and stability of the borrowers management team, earnings projections and their underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. In addition, commercial loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts. 
 Consumer Lending. Our consumer lending portfolio, which totals $23.7 million of December 31, 2020 and represented 6.7% of our total loan portfolio, consisted almost entirely of home equity loans. At December 31, 2020, there were $22.3 million of outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit, which the lines of credit had an additional $25.7 million available to draw. We also offer a variety of consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area, including home equity lines of credit, new and used automobile loans, boat loans, recreational vehicle loans and loans secured by certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2020, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $22.7 million, or 6.9% of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2020, $22.3 million of that amount, or 6.7% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit, on which the lines of credit had $25.7 million available to draw. At December 31, 2020, we had $34,000 of unsecured consumer loans. 
 Generally, our home equity lines of credit are underwritten with a maximum loan to value of 85%, a minimum credit score of 640 and a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%. 
 Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 
 Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans 
 Our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office locations. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period.

 We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such residential loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. We sell the majority of the fixed-rate conforming and eligible jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, on both a servicing-released and servicing-retained basis, with limited or no recourse, while retaining some non-eligible fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold $193.6 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, of which $192.1 million were originated in 2020 and $1.5 million were originated prior to 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $112.2 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 The loans that we originate to sell are closed in our name, and are subsequently sold to our investors who provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conventional products as well as Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Affairs government loans. We recognize, at the time of sale, the cash gain or loss on the sale of the loans based on the difference between the net cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold. Subject to market and economic conditions, management intends to continue this sales activity in future periods to generate gain on sale income. 
 Mortgage servicing rights, which are acquired when we sell a loan but retain the servicing rights, are recognized as a separate asset. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.8 million in mortgage servicing rights. The fair value of our mortgage servicing rights is appraised by a third party provider. Servicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. 
 From time to time, we may purchase commercial real estate and commercial loan participations secured by properties and/or business assets within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2020, we had 11 loans totaling $2.5 million in which we were not the lead lender, all of which were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms. PyraMax Banks growth strategy is to increase our exposure in loan participations. We also have participated out portions of a loan that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. Historically, we have not purchased whole loans, however, pursuant to our growth strategy, we may purchase whole loans in the future. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that PyraMax Bank is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of PyraMax Banks unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by readily marketable collateral or 30% for certain residential development loans). At December 31, 2020, based on the 15% limitation, PyraMax Banks loans-to-one-borrower limit was $7.8 million. On the same date, PyraMax Bank had no individual borrower with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. PyraMax Bank currently has and expects that for the foreseeable future it will continue to have an internal lending limit of $6.0 million, however with the approval of the board of directors loans may be approved up to the legal lending limit of PyraMax Bank. In the future the board of directors may consider increasing or decreasing this internal limit. 
 Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed information submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan information is primarily designed to determine the borrowers ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns. 
 All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate loans, including total balances of outstanding loans and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. Our President and Chief Executive Officer have individual authorization to approve loans up to an aggregate exposure to one borrower of $2.0 million. Our Chief Credit Officer has individual authorization to approve loans up to an aggregate exposure of $1.0 million. Our Vice President-Credit Administration has individual authorization to approve loans up to an aggregate exposure of $500,000. Our Officers Loan Committee, which consists of our President, Chief Brand Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Vice President-Credit Administration and all commercial lenders, can approve loans up to 
 
14 


  $2.0 million in the aggregate. Loans in excess of $2.0 million require the approval of our board of directors, or, if exigent circumstances exist, the Chief Credit Officer and President may approve such loans if the board of directors is unavailable and such approval is based on a recommendation of the Chief Credit Officer and is subsequently approved by the board of directors. 
 In addition, the following individuals have retail consumer loan authority for individual loans: our Chief Brand Officer can approve retail loans up to $200,000; our Vice President-Retail Operations and Senior Underwriters can approve retail loans up to $150,000; our Junior Underwriters can approve retail loans up to $100,000; and one Branch Executive Officer can approve retail loans up to $75,000 while all other Branch Executive Officers can approve retail loans up to $1,000. 
 Our Chief Brand Officer, Vice President-Retail Loan Operations, and Senior Underwriters and Underwriters have authority to approve conforming mortgage loans up to the secondary market limit. 
 Generally, we require title insurance or abstracts on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan. 
 From time to time, a loan applicant may not meet one or more of the loan policy or loan program requirements, resulting in a denial of the loan application. The loan officer may seek an exception, by providing detailed information to explain the policy/program exception along with other pertinent information. The following individuals have the authority to approve these requests with the indicated loan limits for commercial mortgage loans and consumer loans: the board of directors may approve loans with exceptions up to the legal lending limit of PyraMax Bank; the Officers Loan Committee and our President and Chief Executive Officers may approve loans with exceptions up to $2.0 million; and our Chief Credit Officer may approve loans with exceptions up to $1.0 million; Vice President-Credit Administration may approve loans with exceptions up to $500,000. Our Chief Brand Officer has the authority to approve exceptions on conforming mortgage loans up to the secondary market limits, however, the loan would still need to qualify for sale in the secondary market after granting the exception. Our Chief Brand Officer and Resolution Officer have exception authority for consumer loans with limits of $200,000 and $100,000, respectively. 
 Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets 
 Delinquency Procedures for Owner Occupied One- to Four-Family Residential and Consumer Loans. When an owner-occupied residential real estate or consumer loan payment becomes 16 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice, and loan officers and/or members of our loan collection department may contact the customer. If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, we mail an additional late notice, and we also place telephone calls to the borrower. These loan collection efforts continue until a loan becomes 90-120 days past due, at which point we would generally refer the loan for foreclosure proceedings unless management determines that it is in the best interest of PyraMax Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan. The foreclosure process generally would begin when a loan becomes 120 days delinquent. From time to time we may accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure. 
 Delinquency Procedures for Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans. When a commercial loan or commercial real estate loan becomes 10 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice. The loan officer assigned to the account may also contact the borrower. If the loan continues to run past due, the loan officer will continue to contact the borrower to determine the cause of the past due payment(s) and arrange for payments. This information will be discussed with the Chief Credit Officer to determine the nature of the past due payment and, if necessary, to develop a plan to bring the past due payment(s) current and determine if the likelihood of repayment is in question. The loan will also be evaluated for a change to the risk rating. Depending on the circumstances, the lender and Chief Credit Officer may develop a plan to protect PyraMax Banks interest in the loan. If necessary, PyraMax Bank will engage an attorney to pursue further collection efforts. 
 Our High Risk Loan Committee, which consists of our President, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Lending Officer provides oversight of stressed commercial and retail loans to mitigate identified risks.

 Loans Past Due and Non-performing Assets. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on non-accrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received on a cash basis or cost recovery method.
   When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal, or evaluation when acceptable, to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense, in either case during the applicable period of such determination. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. 
 Non-performing Loans. We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on non-accrual loans generally is applied against principal or interest and is recognized on a cash basis. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
 Non-accrual loans decreased to $1.3 million, or 0.39% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 from $2.0 million, or 0.64% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. The decrease in non-accrual loans was primarily due to a decrease in non-accrual loans in the residential real estate loan category. 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings. Loans are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan, and PyraMax Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions include a modification of terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or loan balance, a reduction of accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or some combination thereof to facilitate payment. Troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired loans. No additional loan commitments were outstanding to our troubled debt restructured borrowers at December 31, 2020. 
 Loans on non-accrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2020, we had $219,000 in non-accrual troubled debt restructurings, none of which were in the process of foreclosure as of December 31, 2020. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments. At December 31, 2020, we had $432,000 in accruing troubled debt restructurings. 
 Interest income that would have been recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 had non-accruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to $58,000. In addition, there was an immaterial amount of interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 had accruing troubled debt restructurings been current according to their original terms. 
 Our primary regulatory, the Federal Reserve, and the other federal banking regulators have issued guidance that would allow us not to treat a loan modification as a trouble debt restructuring if we conclude that short-term (e.g., six months) modifications are made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, 
 
16 


  extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant related to loans in which the borrower is less than 30 days past due on its contractual payment at the time a modification program is implemented. Separately, Section 4013 of the CARES Act permits us not to apply the troubled debt restructuring accounting with respect to loans that we modify in response to the COVID-19 pandemic if (1) the borrower was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and (2) the modifications are related to arrangements that defer or delay the payment of principal or interest, or change the interest rate of the loan. Through December 31, 2020, we did not rely on either the regulatory guidance of Section 4013 of the CARES Act as a basis not to classify a modified loan as a troubled debt restructuring. 
 Foreclosed Assets. Foreclosed assets consist of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, and are recorded at the lower of recorded investment or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Write-downs from recorded investment to fair value, which are required at the time of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After transfer, adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, no loans were transferred into foreclosed assets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, one loan of $134,000 was transferred into foreclosed assets. 
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention by our management. 
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses in the loan portfolio. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institutions determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 In accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the watch/special mention list where management has some concern that the collateral or debt service ability may not be adequate, although the collectability of the contractual loan payments is still probable. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to substandard, doubtful or loss depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. For commercial loans, substandard ratings are assigned to loans that do not have adequate collateral and/or debt service ability such that collectability of the contractual loan payments is no longer probable. For commercial loans, doubtful ratings are assigned to loans that do not have adequate collateral and/or debt service ability, and collectability of the contractual loan payments is unlikely. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on non-accrual status and classified substandard. Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in managements judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on managements evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional 
 
17 


  economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, managements ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table sets forth certain ratios related to our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

 The allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans ratio increased to 210.03% at December 31, 2020, compared to 99.35% at December 31, 2019 due to a reduction in non-accrual loans and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Non-accrual loans decreased $726,000, or 36.06%, to $1.3 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $2.0 million at December 31, 2019. We recorded provision expense of $500,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 to reflect the unknown risk within our loan portfolio due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the total loan balances by category, and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

 At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.82% of total loans and 210.03% of non-accrual loans, and at December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.64% of total loans and 99.35% of non-accrual loans. There were $(203,000) and $230,000 in net loan charge-offs (recoveries) during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Investment Activities 
 General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Our board of directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our president and chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. All of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale.
We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.

 Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at December 31, 2020. Weighted average yields are calculated by multiplying the effective yield by the amortized cost on an individual security basis divided by the total security class amortized cost. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax equivalent basis using a combined federal and state marginal tax rate of 27.2%. Certain mortgage-backed securities have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below. Weighted average yield calculations on investment securities available for sale do not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of equity.

 Obligations of State and Political Subdivision (Municipal) Securities. At December 31, 2020, we had municipal securities totaling $11.8 million, which constituted 20.1% of our securities portfolio. Our current municipal securities have a weighted average maturity of 6.52 years. These securities often provide slightly higher after-tax yields than U.S. government and agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, but are not as liquid as other investments, so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities, to the extent appropriate, for generating returns in our investment portfolio. 
 Government-sponsored Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2020, we had government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities totaling $38.0 million, which constituted 64.8% of our securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as pass-through certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is passed through to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. All of our mortgage-backed securities are either backed by Ginnie Mae, a U.S. government agency, the SBA, or government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 Residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
 Corporate Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. At December 31, 2020, we had no corporate collateralized mortgage obligations. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection. 
 Asset-backed Securities. At December 31, 2020 we had asset-backed securities comprised of pools of student loans totaling $7.3 million, which constituted 12.4% of our securities portfolio. All of our asset-backed securities are investment grade and have interest rates tied to an index (LIBOR). 
 Certificates of Deposit. At December 31, 2020, we had certificates of deposit totaling $1.6 million, which constituted 2.7% of our securities portfolio. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. We held common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2020. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago common stock is carried at cost. We may be required to purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock if we increase borrowings in the future. 
 Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for certain of our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us non-interest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2020, our balance in bank-owned life insurance totaled $13.5 million and was issued by two insurance companies, each of which was rated AA+ by Standard & Poors. 
Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 
21 


 Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including non-interest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts, statement savings, health savings and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. At December 31, 2020, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were $292.2 million, representing 76.9% of total deposits. As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue our effort to increase our core deposits. 
 Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates. 
 Our strategy is to not be the market leader in overall pricing for deposits. We find it more profitable to concentrate on specific special rate and term accounts, which allows us to add accounts without impacting our overall liability costs for existing accounts. We concentrate on odd-month, longer term certificates and larger minimum balance non-maturity deposits to generate new funds. Additionally, we have an established Treasury Management department, which concentrates on gathering deposits from both existing commercial loan clients and new commercial prospects. We anticipate that Treasury Management activities will continue to have a positive impact on lower cost deposits and will aid in retaining full service clients.

 Borrowed Funds. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago upon the security of our capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and certain mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. We use such advances to provide funding as a supplement to our deposits. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2020, we had $68.4 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. At December 31, 2020 our available and unused portion of this borrowing agreement totaled $79.6 million, although we may access additional advances if we purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago capital stock. 
 Additionally, at December 31, 2020 we had a $10.0 million federal funds rate line of credit with the BMO Harris Bank, none of which was drawn at December 31, 2020. We also had a $7.0 million line of credit at the Federal Reserve based on pledged commercial real estate loans of approximately $11.7 million at December 31, 2020. We had not drawn on the Federal Reserve line as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.

 TAXATION 
 PyraMax Bank, PyraMax Insurance Services LLC, 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC, the Company, PyraMax Bank and PyraMax Insurance Services LLC. 
 The Company is no longer subject to federal tax examinations for years before 2017 and state tax examinations before 2016. 
 Federal Taxation 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company and PyraMax Bank currently report their income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing their federal income tax returns. the Company and PyraMax Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, PyraMax Bank has been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. It currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code). 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for federal losses originating in tax years after January 1, 2018, the Company is allowed an indefinite carryforward period limited to 80% of each subsequent years net income. The CARES Act temporarily repealed this 80% limitation for the calendar year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryover of $9.9 million that will begin to expire in 2029. Of this $9.9 million, $1.8 million has no expiration due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. the Company also has $0.4 million of charitable contribution carryforwards that may be applied against future taxable income and begin to expire in 2022. 
 Corporate Dividends. The Company may generally exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from PyraMax Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 State Taxation 
 The Company is subject to the Wisconsin corporate franchise (income) tax. Wisconsin imposes a corporate franchise tax of 7.9% on the combined taxable incomes of the members of the Companys consolidated income tax group, which will include PyraMax Bank and PyraMax Bank Insurance Services, LLC. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Wisconsin law allows financial institutions to carry forward a Wisconsin net operating loss to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2020, the Company had Wisconsin net operating loss carryover of $20.2 million that will begin to expire in 2023. the Company also has $0.4 million of charitable contribution carryforwards that may be applied against future taxable income and begin to expire in 2022.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 As a federal savings bank, PyraMax Bank is subject to examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and is also subject to examination by the FDIC as its deposit insurer. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which PyraMax Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the protection of security holders. PyraMax Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 
24 


 Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; provide oversight for the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings, interest rate sensitivity and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as PyraMax Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches. 
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Many financial consumer protection statutes are implemented by regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For federal savings banks of PyraMax Bank FSBs asset size, compliance with such statutes and regulations is determined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency through its examinations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is also be subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of the Company and PyraMax Bank. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to PyraMax Bank and the Company. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on PyraMax Bank and the Company. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Business Activities. A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, PyraMax Bank may generally invest in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate without an aggregate limit and may invest in commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. PyraMax Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, operating subsidiaries that engage in activities permitted for PyraMax itself and service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for PyraMax Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 Effective July 1, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a final rule implementing a section of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) which permits an eligible federal savings bank with assets of $20.0 billion or less as of December 31, 2017 to elect to operate with the business powers of a national bank, generally subject to the same limitations and restrictions, without converting to a national bank charter. A federal savings bank that makes the so-called covered savings association election must divest any activities or investments that are not permitted for a national bank. PyraMax Bank had not made such an election as of December 31, 2020.

 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk-weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 EGRRCPA required the federal banking agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8% and 10% for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. Institutions with a capital level at or exceeding the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements, and electing the alternative framework, are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. Final rules issued by the agencies established the community bank leverage ratio at 9% Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8% or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements. 
 The CARES Act lowered the community bank leverage ratio to 8%, with a federal regulation making the reduced ratio effective April 23, 2020. The Company did not opt in to the community bank leverage ratio framework for the year ended December 30, 2020. Another regulation was issued to transition back to the 9% community bank leverage ratio by increasing the ratio to 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and to 9% thereafter. 
 At December 31, 2020, PyraMax Banks capital exceeded all applicable requirements. 
 Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank, including a covered savings association, may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the excess is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. At December 31, 2020, PyraMax Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends and other transactions charged to the savings banks capital account. A federal savings bank must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if: 
 
26 


 
 | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings banks net income for that year to date plus the savings banks retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings, generally due to an unsatisfactory CAMELS rating or being subject to a cease and desist order or formal written agreement that requires action to improve the institutions financial condition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as PyraMax Bank, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 
 A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 
 

 | the federal savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act generally provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings bank also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings banks record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings banks failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 In June 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a final rule clarifying and expanding the activities that qualify for Community Reinvestment Act credit and, according to the agency, seeking to create a more consistent and objective method for evaluating Community Reinvestment Act performance. The final rule was effective October 1, 2020, but compliance with certain of the revised requirements is not mandatory for institutions of PyraMax Banks asset size until January 1, 2024. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. PyraMax Bank received a outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 
 Transactions with Related Parties. An insured depository institutions authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with, an insured depository institution such as PyraMax Bank, FSB. The Company is an affiliate of PyraMax Bank because of its control of PyraMax Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that 
 
27 


  are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.
PyraMax Banks authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
 

 | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of PyraMax Banks capital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by PyraMax Banks board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings banks and has authority to bring enforcement action against all institution-affiliated parties, including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings bank. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federal savings bank. If such action is not taken, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 Branching. A federal savings bank that has not elected covered savings association status generally has authority to establish branches in any state or states of the United States and its territories. Such authority is subject to Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approval for new branches. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, 
 
28 


  a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized banks compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institutions total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an undercapitalized bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized banks must comply with one or more additional restrictions, including a regulatory order to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, ceasing receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismissal of directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 The previously referenced final rule establishing an elective community bank leverage ratio regulatory capital framework provides that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered well-capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action. 
 At December 31, 2020, PyraMax Bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as PyraMax Bank, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 Under the FDICs risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institutions failure within three years. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of PyraMax Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
 Privacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that PyraMax Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customers non-public personal information, to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, PyraMax Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to opt-out of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. PyraMax Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.

 USA PATRIOT Act. PyraMax Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies and imposes affirmative obligations on financial institutions, such as enhanced recordkeeping and customer identification requirements. 
 Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by PyraMax Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

 | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The deposit operations of PyraMax Bank also are subject to, among others, the: 
 

 | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 PyraMax Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. PyraMax Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2020. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. PyraMax Bank reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago stock. At December 31, 2020, no impairment had been recognized. 
 
30 


 Holding Company Regulation 
 The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to PyraMax Bank. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, the Companys activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies (if the Company makes an election to be treated as a financial holding company and meets the other requirements to be a financial holding company) or multiple savings and loan holding companies. The Company has no present intention to make an election to be treated as a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, insurance and underwriting equity securities. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by federal regulation, including activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act. 
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such factors as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state savings and loan holding companies. 
 Savings and loan holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise in particular cases. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the source of strength doctrine that require holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies, to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued supervisory policies regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the companys net income for the past four quarters, net of capital distributions previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the companys overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the companys capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. Federal Reserve Board guidance also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result, at the end of a quarter, in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
31 


 Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institutions directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. There is a presumption of control upon the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock under certain circumstances, such as where the holding company involved has its shares registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a final rule, effective September 30, 2020, that revises its framework for determining whether a company has a controlling influence over a bank or savings and loan holding company for purposes of the Bank and Savings and Loan Holding Company Acts. 
 Federal Securities Laws 
 The Companys common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 The Company is an emerging growth company. For as long as the Company continues to be an emerging growth company, it may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, the Company also is subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 The Company will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of its subscription offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million at the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.
