ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Cemtrex was incorporated in 1998, in the state of Delaware and has evolved through strategic acquisitions and internal growth into a leading multi-industry technology company. The Company has expanded in a wide range of sectors, including smart technologies, virtual and augmented realities, industrial solutions, and intelligent security systems. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “we”, “our”, “us”, “Company”, “registrant”, “Cemtrex” or “management” refer to Cemtrex, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
The Company continuously assesses the composition of its portfolio businesses to ensure it is aligned with its strategic objectives and positioned to maximize growth and return in the coming years. During fiscal 2018, the Company made a strategic decision to exit its Electronics Manufacturing group by selling all companies in that business segment on August 15, 2019. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of the Electronics Manufacturing business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These changes have been applied for all periods presented. During fiscal 2019, the Company also reached a strategic decision to exit the environmental products business, which was part of the Industrial Services Segment. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of the environmental control products business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
Now the Company has two business segments, consisting of (i) Advanced Technologies (AT) and (ii) Industrial Services (IS).

Advanced Technologies (AT)
 
Cemtrex’s Advanced Technologies segment delivers cutting-edge technologies in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Devices, such as the SmartDesk. Through the Company’s advanced engineering and product design, the Company delivers Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) solutions that provide higher productivity, progressive design and impactful experiences for consumer products, and various commercial and industrial applications. The Company is in the process of developing virtual reality applications for commercialization over the next couple years.
 
The AT business segment also includes the Company’s majority owned subsidiary, Vicon Industries, which provides end-to-end security solutions to meet the toughest corporate, industrial and governmental security challenges. Vicon’s products include browser-based video monitoring systems and analytics-based recognition systems, cameras, servers, and access control systems for every aspect of security and surveillance in industrial and commercial facilities, federal prisons, hospitals, universities, schools, and federal and state government offices. Vicon provides cutting edge, mission critical security and video surveillance solutions utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) based data algorithms.
 
Industrial Services (IS)
 
Cemtrex’s IS segment, offers single-source expertise and services for rigging, millwrighting, in plant maintenance, equipment erection, relocation, and disassembly to diversified customers. We install high precision equipment in a wide variety of industrial markets like automotive, printing & graphics, industrial automation, packaging, and chemicals among others. We are a leading provider of reliability-driven maintenance and contracting solutions for the machinery, packaging, printing, chemical, and other manufacturing markets. The focus is on customers seeking to achieve greater asset utilization and reliability to cut costs and increase production from existing assets, including small projects, sustaining capital, turnarounds, maintenance, specialty welding services, and high-quality scaffolding.
Recent Developments
 
Potential Impacts of COVID-19 on our Business
 
The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and the results of our operations in this fiscal year, primarily with delays in expected orders by many customers and new product development, including newer versions of surveillance software since our technical facility in Pune, India has been under lock down. Overall bookings level in the IS segment of our business is down by more than 20%, however our AT segment has experienced relatively less slow down. In addition, due to delays in certain supply chain areas, the expected launch times of our new products and new versions has resulted in delays of several months.
 
The broader implications of COVID-19 on our results from operations going forward remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause adverse effects to our customers, suppliers or business partners in locations that have or will experience more pronounced disruptions, which could result in a reduction to future revenue and manufacturing output as well as delays in our new product development activities. However, on the other hand, opportunities in the video surveillance field have been growing for Vicon products.
 
The extent of the pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend in large part on future developments, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Future developments include the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact both within and outside the jurisdictions where we operate, the impact on governmental programs and budgets, the development of treatments or vaccines, and the resumption of widespread economic activity. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation, we are unable to predict with any confidence the likely impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations.

Business Strategy
 
We intend to continue utilizing our resource capabilities to deliver exceptional value for our customers, shareholders, and employees. Our focus is to grow in markets where we see significant long-term opportunity to create an attractive return on shareholder equity. We leverage our engineering, manufacturing expertise and strong customer relationships to develop new cutting-edge technologies and advanced products that solve technological challenges faced by our customers. We thoroughly analyze new product opportunities by considering projected demand for the product or service, and expected operating costs, and then only pursue those opportunities which we believe will contribute to earnings growth in the future. In addition, we believe our senior management team has substantial business and technical experience to enable us to pursue our business strategies.
 
The Company believes its ability to attract and retain new customers comes from their ongoing commitment to understanding its customers’ business performance requirements and our expertise in meeting or exceeding these requirements and enhancing their competitive edge through cutting edge technology. We work closely with our customers from an operational and senior executive level to achieve a deep understanding of our customer’s goals, challenges, strategies, operations, and products to ultimately provide the best solutions for them.
 
We continue to seek and execute additional strategic acquisitions and focus on expanding our products and services as well as entering into new markets. We believe that the diversity of our products & services and our ability to deliver full solutions to a variety of end markets provides us with multiple sources of stable growth and a competitive advantage relative to other players in the industry. We constantly look for opportunities to gain new customers and penetrate geographic locations and end markets or acquire new product or service opportunities through acquisitions that are operationally and financially beneficial for the Company. However, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our strategies.
 
SUPPLIERS
 
The Company is not dependent on, nor expects to become dependent on, any one or a limited number of suppliers. The Company buys parts and components to assemble and manufacture its equipment and products. The Company also utilizes sub-suppliers and third-party vendors to procure from or fabricate its components based on its design, engineering and specifications. The Company also enters into subcontracts for field installation, which the Company supervises; and the Company manages all technical, physical and commercial aspects of the performance of the Company contracts. To date, the Company has not experienced major difficulties either in obtaining fabricated components and other materials and parts or in obtaining qualified subcontractors for installation work, however, there have been some delays in certain components due to COVID-19. The Company seeks to have many sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters, international trade tariffs, wars, pandemics, disputes and or other events. Despite market price volatility for certain requirements and materials pricing pressures at some of our businesses, the raw materials and various purchased components needed for the Company’s products have generally been available in sufficient quantities.
COMPETITION
 
The Company faces substantial competition in each of its products & services and principal markets. Most of its competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company; several are divisions of multi-national companies. The Company competes on the basis of price, engineering and technological expertise, know-how and the quality of its products, systems and services. Additionally, the Company’s management believes that the successful delivery, installation and performance of the Company’s products and systems is a key factor in gaining business as customers typically prefer to make significant purchases from a company with a solid performance history.
 
The Company obtains virtually all its contracts through competitive bidding. Although price is an important factor and may in some cases be the governing factor, it is not always determinative, and contracts are often awarded on the basis of the efficiency or reliability of products, past performance records, and the engineering and technical expertise of the bidder. Several companies market products that compete directly with Company’s products. Other companies offer products that potential customers may consider to be acceptable alternatives to Company’s products and services. The Company faces direct competition from companies with far greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Over the years, the Company has developed proprietary technologies that give it an edge in competing with its competitors. Thus, the Company relies on a combination of trade secrets and know-how to protect its intellectual property. The Company currently has multiple patents and patent claims that it owns. Additionally, the Company has multiple patent applications pending related to the development of SmartDesk and will pursue those patents based upon its financial resources. Cemtrex continues to invest in research and development with intention of developing proprietary technology and intellectual property as allowed by its financial resources.
MARKETING
 
The Company sells its products globally and relies on direct sales force, manufacturing representatives, distributors, integrators and installers, commission sales agents, magazine advertisements, internet advertising, trade shows, trade directories and catalogue listings to market its products and services. The Company uses independent manufacturing representatives in the United States and throughout the world, backed by its sales management and technical professionals. The Company’s arrangements with independent sales representatives accord each a defined territory within which to sell some or all of its products and systems, provide for the payment of agreed-upon sales commissions or wholesale pricing and are terminable at will. The Company’s sales representatives do not have authority to execute contracts on the Company’s behalf.
 
The Company’s sales representatives also serve as ongoing liaison function between the Company and its customers during the installation phase of the products and systems and address customers’ questions or concerns arising thereafter. The Company selects representatives based upon industry reputation, prior sales performance including number of prospective leads generated and sales closure rates, and the breadth of territorial coverage, among other criteria.
 
Technical inquiries received from potential customers are referred to the engineering personnel. Thereafter, the Company’s sales and engineering personnel jointly prepare a budget proposal, or a final bid. The period between initial customer contact and issuance of an order is generally between two and twelve months.
 
The Company has been selling its SmartDesk directly from its website whereby customers can place orders and make payments. The Company has been marketing SmartDesk through direct to consumer internet channels, including social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram as well as showcasing the product at several trade shows. The Company plans to continue its marketing efforts for the SmartDesk by marketing the product to enterprise clients and increase its overall marketing and sales efforts in online media.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
The Company’s principal customers in its AT segment are generally consumers, government agencies or commercial businesses. The Company’s principal customers in its IS segment include businesses engaged in manufacturing, chemical, packaging, printing, electronics, automotive, construction, and metallurgical processing. Historically, most of the customers have purchased individual products or systems which, in many instances, operate in conjunction with products and systems supplied by others. No one single customer accounts for more than 10% of its annual sales.
 
For the AT segment, the Company is responsible for the design, production, supply, and delivery of products to its customers. In order to satisfy customer orders, the Company must consistently meet production deadlines and maintain a high standard of quality.
 
INSURANCE
 
The Company currently maintains different types of insurance, including general liability and property coverage. The Company also maintains product liability insurance with respect to its products and equipment. Management believes that the insurance coverage that it has is adequate for its current business needs.
