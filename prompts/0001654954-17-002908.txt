ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
  
 Blue Dolphin is primarily an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products. Our primary asset is a 15,000-bpd crude oil and condensate processing facility that is in Nixon, Texas (the “Nixon Facility”). As part of our refinery business segment, we also conduct petroleum storage and terminaling operations under third-party lease agreements at the Nixon Facility. Under our pipeline transportation business segment, we own pipeline assets and have leasehold interests in oil and gas wells. Our pipeline transportation business segment represented less than 1% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.We maintain a website at http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com. Information on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference in or otherwise made a part of this Annual Report.

 Operating Risks – Going Concern
  
 Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Execution of our business strategy depends on several factors, including adequate crude oil and condensate sourcing, levels of accounts receivable, refined petroleum product inventories, accounts payable, capital expenditures, and adequate access to credit on satisfactory terms. For the year ended December 31, 2016, execution of our business strategy was negatively impacted by several factors, including:
  
   ●
 Net Losses – For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported a net loss of $15,767,448, or a loss of $1.51 per share, compared to net income of $4,403,239, or income of $0.42 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $1.93 per share decrease in net income between the periods was the result of lower margins on refined petroleum products, lower refinery throughput and significant refinery downtime, higher refinery operating expenses, and income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. Margins on refined petroleum products decreased primarily because of lower crack spreads.

 
   ●
 Working Capital Deficits – We had a working capital deficit of $37,812,263 at December 31, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $598,807 at December 31, 2015. The significant increase in working capital deficit between the periods primarily related to reclassification of secured long-term debt (and the related debt issue costs) with Sovereign Bank (“Sovereign”) to the current portion within long-term debt. Excluding long-term debt, we had a working capital deficit of $6,099,927 at December 31, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $598,807 at December 31, 2015. The significant increase in working capital deficit between the periods was primarily the result of sustaining net losses in 2016 compared to net income in 2015 as described above.

 
   ●
 Adverse Change in Relationship with Genesis Energy, LLP (“Genesis”) and GEL Tex Marketing, LLC (“GEL”) – We are party to a variety of contracts and agreements with Genesis and GEL for the purchase of crude oil and condensate, transportation of crude oil and condensate, and other services. We currently have a contract-related dispute with GEL related to certain of these agreements. The adverse change in our relationship with Genesis and GEL has had a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. In addition, the contract-related dispute has affected our ability to obtain financings, prevented us from taking advantage of business opportunities, disrupted our normal business operations, and diverted management’s focus away from operations. We expect these effects to continue until the dispute is resolved.  We are unable to predict the outcome of the current proceedings with Genesis and GEL or their ultimate impact, if any, on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution of the dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and financial condition and results of operations.

 
   ●
 Crude Supply Issues – Historically, we purchased light crude oil and condensate for the Nixon Facility from GEL pursuant to a Crude Oil Supply and Throughput Services Agreement (the “Crude Supply Agreement”). As noted above, we are currently involved in a contract-related dispute with GEL related to the Crude Supply Agreement. In connection with this dispute, GEL significantly under-delivered crude oil and condensate to the Nixon Facility during 2016. This resulted in 59 days of refinery downtime and significant decreases in refinery throughput and refined petroleum product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, we ceased purchases of crude oil and condensate from GEL in November 2016, and we began using an alternate crude oil and condensate supplier. We believe that adequate supplies of crude oil and condensate for the Nixon Facility will continue to be available to us from the alternate supplier. We are working to put a long-term crude supply agreement in place, however, our ability to purchase adequate supplies of crude oil and condensate is dependent on our liquidity and access to capital, which have been adversely affected by the contract-related dispute with GEL and other factors, as noted above.

 
   ●
 Financial Covenant Defaults – At December 31, 2016, we were in violation of certain financial covenants in secured loan agreements with Sovereign. Covenant defaults under the secured agreements would permit Sovereign to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing our obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Sovereign waived the financial covenant defaults as of the year ended December 31, 2016. However, the debt associated with these loans was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet the financial covenants in the future. There can be no assurance that Sovereign will provide future waivers, which may have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.

 We are taking aggressive actions to improve operations and liquidity by: (i) continuing with Nixon Facility capital improvements, including upgrading the refinery’s heat exchangers and increasing petroleum storage tank capacity, (ii) increasing military jet fuel sales and low-sulfur diesel exports to Mexico, (iii) restructuring customer contracts as they come up for renewal to incorporate minimum sales volumes, (iv) working to secure a long-term crude oil and condensate supply arrangement, (v) exploring alternative funding sources for crude oil and condensate purchases, and (vi) seeking additional financing to meet ongoing liquidity needs. There can be no assurance that our plan will be successful or that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

  Refining Industry Overview
  
 Crude oil refining is the process of separating the hydrocarbons present in crude oil into usable or refined petroleum products such as naphtha, diesel, jet fuel and other products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business where both crude oil and refined petroleum products are commodities with prices that can fluctuate independently for short periods due to supply, demand, transportation and other factors. To increase profitability, or improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of higher value petroleum products and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. There are also several operational efficiencies that can be deployed to improve margins. These include selecting the appropriate crude oil or condensate to fulfill anticipated product demand, increasing the amount and value of refined petroleum products processed from the crude oil or condensate, reducing downtime for maintenance, repair and investment, developing valuable by-products or production inputs out of materials that are typically discarded, and adjusting utilization rates.
  
 A refinery's product slate depends on the refinery's configuration and the type of crude oil and/or condensate being refined, and can be adjusted based on market demand. Although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil generally results in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products, there is normally a time lag in the realization of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on a refinery’s results of operations depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined petroleum products prices adjust to reflect these changes.
  
  Our Primary Operating Asset
  
  Nixon Facility
  
 The Nixon Facility, which is located on a 56-acre site in Nixon, Texas, has aggregate crude oil throughput capacity of 15,000 bpd. The Nixon Facility consists of a distillation unit, naphtha stabilizer unit, depropanizer unit, and related loading and unloading facilities and utilities. At December 31, 2016, the refinery had approximately 842,000 bbls of crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity in 27 tanks. We are currently constructing an additional 256,000 bbls of petroleum storage capacity at the site. When construction is complete, total crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity at the Nixon Facility will exceed 1,000,000 bbls.

 A regional electric cooperative supplies electrical power to the Nixon Facility. Fuel gas (LPGs) that are produced at the Nixon Facility are primarily used as fuel within the refinery. In addition, small amounts of propane are occasionally acquired for use in starting-up the Nixon Facility.
  
  Nixon Facility Process Summary
  
 The Nixon Facility is considered a “topping unit” because it is primarily comprised of a crude distillation unit, the first stage of the crude oil refining process. The Nixon Facility’s current level of complexity allows us to refine crude oil and condensate into finished and intermediate petroleum products. The below diagram represents a high-level overview of the current crude oil and condensate refining process at the Nixon Facility.
  
  Example represents a simplified plant configuration. The specific configuration will vary based on various market and operational factors.
  
 
  Turnaround and Refinery Reliability
  
 We are committed to the safe and efficient operation of the Nixon Facility. Turnarounds are used to repair, restore, refurbish or replace refinery equipment such as vessels, tanks, reactors, piping, rotating equipment, instrumentation, electrical equipment, heat exchangers and fired heaters. Typically, a refinery undergoes a major facility turnaround every three to five years. Since the Nixon Facility is still in the recommissioning phase, one or more of the units may require additional unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds.
 Crude Oil and Condensate Supply
  
 Historically, we purchased light crude oil and condensate for the Nixon Facility from GEL pursuant to the Crude Supply Agreement. The Crude Supply Agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms until August 2019 unless GEL provides us with notice of non-renewal at least 180 days prior to expiration of any renewal term. The parties are currently involved in a contract-related dispute. As a result, we ceased purchases of crude oil and condensate from GEL in November 2016, and we began using an alternate crude oil and condensate supplier. See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Key Relationships – Relationship with Genesis and GEL” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (20) Commitments and Contingencies – Genesis Agreements” and “Legal Matters” of this Annual Report for more information related to GEL and the Crude Supply Agreement.

 In June 2016, we entered a month-to-month evergreen crude oil supply contract with a major integrated oil and gas company as back-up to the Crude Supply Agreement. We believe that adequate supplies of crude oil and condensate for the Nixon Facility will continue to be available to us from the alternate supplier. We are working to put a long-term crude supply agreement in place, however, our ability to purchase adequate supplies of crude oil and condensate is dependent on our liquidity and access to capital, which have been adversely affected by net losses, working capital deficits, the contract-related dispute with GEL, and financial covenant defaults in secured loan agreements.
  
 The Nixon Facility processes light crude oil sourced from the Eagle Ford Shale. The crude oil and condensate is received at the Nixon Facility by truck and stored in tanks. The Nixon Facility’s property is crossed by a crude oil and condensate pipeline owned by Koch Pipeline Company. The pipeline represents a potential future opportunity to receive crude oil and condensate at the Nixon Facility, which could reduce trucking costs.
  
  Products and Markets
  
  Products
  
  The Nixon Facility’s product slate can be adjusted based on market demand. We currently produce two finished products – jet fuel and low-sulfur diesel. We produce several intermediate products, including LPG, naphtha, HOBM, and AGO.
 Markets
  
  The Nixon Facility is in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which is represented by the Energy Information Administration as Petroleum Administration for Defense District 3 (“PADD 3”). Although our products are primarily sold in the U.S. within PADD 3, with the 2016 opening of the Mexican diesel market to private companies, we began selling low-sulfur diesel to customers that are exporting to Mexico. Jet fuel from the Nixon Facility is sold in nearby markets to wholesalers. Our intermediate products are primarily sold in nearby markets to wholesalers and refiners as a feedstock for further blending and processing.
 Customers
  
 Customers for our refined petroleum products include distributors, wholesalers and refineries primarily in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston - San Antonio - Dallas/Fort Worth area). We have bulk term contracts, including month-to-month, six months, and up to five year terms, in place with most of our customers. Certain of our contracts require us to sell fixed quantities and/or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products and many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation, which could result in us receiving higher or lower relative prices for our refined petroleum products. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (14) Concentration of Risk” of this Annual Report for disclosures related to significant customers.
 Competition
  
  Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and are engaged on a national or international basis in many segments of the petroleum products business, including exploration and production, refining, transportation and marketing. These competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these business segments. We compete primarily based on cost. Due to the low complexity of our simple “topping unit” refinery, we can be relatively nimble in adjusting our refined petroleum products slate because of changing commodity prices, market demand, and refinery operating costs.

 Business Strategies
  
 Our management team is dedicated to improving our operations by executing the following strategies:
  
  Capital and Efficiency Improvements
  
 In 2015, we secured $35.0 million in 19-year financing to expand the Nixon Facility. During 2016, capital improvements at the Nixon Facility primarily related to construction of new petroleum storage tanks to add to existing petroleum storage tank capacity. In 2016, we completed construction of four new tanks, and began construction on several additional new tanks that will be completed in 2017. When expansion of the Nixon Facility is complete, total crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity will exceed 1,000,000 bbls.
  
 Overall improvements at the Nixon Facility will position us for long-term growth by: (i) having crude and product storage to support refinery throughput and future expansion of up to 30,000 bbls per day; (ii) increasing the processing capacity and complexity of the Nixon Facility for expanded refined product opportunities; and (iii) generating additional revenue from leasing product and crude storage to third parties.
  
 Capital expenditures at the Nixon Facility are being funded primarily through borrowings under credit bank facilities that were secured in 2015. Capital expenditures as of the dates indicated were as follows:
 
 
 | Years Ended December 31,
--------------------+-------------------------
 | 2016 | 2015 
Cash disbursements | $14,100,897 | $11,370,993
Accounts payable(1) | 2,286,082 | 873,665 
 | $16,386,979 | $12,244,658


 
(1) Represents construction-related vendor invoices awaiting payment from the loan disbursement account.
  
 During 2016, capital improvements at the Nixon Facility primarily related to construction of new petroleum storage tanks to add to existing petroleum storage tank capacity. In 2016, we completed construction of four new tanks, and we began construction on several additional new tanks that will be completed in 2017. When expansion of the Nixon Facility is complete, total crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity will exceed 1,000,000 bbls. (See “Part I, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (10) Long-Term Debt, Net” for additional disclosures related to borrowings for capital spending.)
  
  Explore New Revenue Opportunities
  
 In April 2016, private companies were authorized to participate in the Mexican diesel market, part of recent energy reforms in Mexico that opened the doors to private foreign investment. As a result, we began exporting low-sulfur diesel to Mexico via truck in the second quarter of 2016. We also began fulfilling heavy oil-based mud blendstock orders from new customers within PADD 3 by barge. Going forward, we will continue to explore ways to maximize refined petroleum product sales through new delivery mediums.
  
 In addition to new delivery modes, we also began restructuring customer agreements as they come up for renewal. New pricing models with minimum volume requirements are expected to further improve revenue in 2017.

----------------------------+---------------

 Pipeline Transportation
  
 Our pipeline transportation operations involve the gathering and transportation of oil and natural gas for producers/shippers operating offshore near our pipelines, as well as leasehold interests in oil and natural gas properties, in the Gulf of Mexico. Our pipeline transportation operations represented less than 1% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
  
 We recorded an impairment expense of $968,684 related to our pipeline assets at December 31, 2016. All pipeline transportation services to third-parties have ceased, existing third-party wells along our pipeline corridor are being permanently abandoned, and no new third-party wells are being drilled near our pipelines. However, management believes our pipeline assets have future value based on large-scale, third-party production facility expansion projects near the pipelines. Our oil and gas properties had no production during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. All leases associated with our oil and gas properties have expired, and our oil and gas properties were fully impaired in 2011.
  
  Acquisition, Disposition and Restructuring Activities
  
 We regularly engage in discussions with third-parties regarding the possible purchase of assets and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. However, we do not anticipate any material acquisition activity in the foreseeable future.
  
 In 2013, the Board established a Master Limited Partnership (“MLP”) Conversion Special Committee to oversee a potential conversion of Blue Dolphin from a Delaware “C” corporation to a Delaware MLP. Due to a shift in market conditions over the past three years, the MLP Conversion Special Committee determined that a conversion in the foreseeable future would not be in the best interests of shareholders.
  
  Insurance and Risk Management
  
 Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in crude oil and condensate refining operations and in the transportation and storage of crude oil and condensate, as well as finished and intermediate petroleum products. We have property damage and business interruption coverage at the Nixon Facility. Business interruption coverage is for 24 months from the date of the loss, subject to a deductible with a 45-day waiting period. Our property damage insurance has deductibles ranging from $5,000 to $500,000. In addition, we have a full suite of insurance policies covering workers’ compensation, general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, environmental liability, and other business risks. These are supported by safety and other risk management programs. See also, “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business” in this Annual Report.
 Governmental Regulation
  
 Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety statutes, regulations, and ordinances. These rules govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum, solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and hazardous substances; the emission and discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection; waste management; characteristics and composition of diesel and other fuels; and the monitoring, reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions. These laws impose costly obligations on our operations, including requiring the acquisition of permits and authorizations to conduct regulated activities, restricting the way regulated activities are conducted, limiting the quantities and types of materials that may be released into the environment, and requiring the monitoring of releases of materials into the environment.
  
 Failure to comply with environmental, health or safety laws and our existing permits or other authorizations issued under such laws could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, injunctive relief compelling the installation of additional controls, a revocation of our permits, and/or the shutdown of our facilities.

BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY | 2016 FORM 10-K
----------------------------+---------------


 
 We cannot predict the extent to which additional environmental, health, and safety laws will be enacted in the future, or how existing or future laws will be interpreted with respect to our operations. Many environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. The cost of compliance with and governmental enforcement of environmental, health, and safety laws may increase in the future. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures or incur increased operating costs to achieve or sustain compliance with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws. This Governmental Regulation section should be read in conjunction with “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report, which discusses our expectations regarding future events based on currently available information.
  
  Air Emissions
  
  Toxic Air Pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) is a comprehensive law that regulates toxic air pollutants from stationary and mobile sources. Among other things, the law authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and public welfare and to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants. The CAA, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations regarding emissions of pollutants into the air, affect our crude oil and condensate processing operations and impact certain emissions sources located offshore. Under the CAA, facilities that emit volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) or nitrogen oxides face increasingly stringent regulations.
  
 Refineries, which are major stationary sources of Hazardous Air Pollutants (“HAPs”), have historically been high-visibility targets for enforcement by the EPA under the CAA. In 1995, the EPA implemented the National Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for petroleum refineries. These standards require petroleum refineries to meet emission standards reflecting the application of the maximum achievable control technology. The affected sources at petroleum refineries are defined to include all process vents, storage vessels, marine tank vessel loading operations, gasoline rack operations, equipment leaks, and wastewater treatment systems located at the refinery. To meet emission standards, we are required to obtain permits, as well as test, monitor, report, and implement control requirements.
  
 In 2007, the EPA finalized a rule to reduce HAPs from mobile sources.  Mobile Source Air Toxics (“MSAT”) regulations established stringent new controls on gasoline, passenger vehicles, and gas cans to further reduce emissions of mobile source air toxics. The EPA has continued to adopt MSAT emission control programs to further reduce HAPs from mobile sources, including sulfur control requirements in gasoline and diesel transportation fuels. New sulfur control standards required most refineries to produce transportation fuels for highway use at or below 15 ppm sulfur for “on-road” diesel and 30 ppm sulfur for gasoline. “Off-road” diesel requirements were also reduced to 15 ppm sulfur in 2014. The Nixon Facility does not produce gasoline, and the facility ceased production of NRLM, a transportation-related diesel fuel product in 2014.  In 2014, the Nixon Facility began producing HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product.  The shift in product slate from NRLM to HOBM was the result of the EPA’s new sulfur control requirements. “Topping units,” like the Nixon Facility, typically lack a desulfurization process unit to lower sulfur content levels within the range required by the EPA’s new sulfur control standards, and integration of such a desulfurization unit generally requires additional permitting and significant capital upgrades. We can produce and sell diesel with sulfur content levels above the EPA’s new sulfur control standards in the U.S. as a feedstock to other refineries and blenders and to other countries as a finished petroleum product.
  
 In May 2016, the EPA took further steps to cut emissions of methane from the oil and gas industry by issuing three (3) final rules intended to curb emissions of methane, VOC’s, and air toxics from new, reconstructed and modified oil and gas sources, while providing greater certainty about CAA permitting requirements for the industry. The EPA also issued for public comment an Information Collection Request (“ICR”) to obtain extensive information instrumental for developing regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources.
  
  Greenhouse Gas Emissions. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Massachusetts vs. EPA that emission of Greenhouse Gases (“GHGs”) may be regulated under the CAA. In 2009, the EPA published its findings that GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, are contributing to the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic conditions, presenting a potential danger to public health and the environment. By allowing the regulation of GHGs under the CAA, the EPA’s findings also indirectly impacted many other carbon-intensive industries, which would potentially become subject to federal New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V permitting requirements under the CAA (the “CAA Permitting Requirements”). 
  
   
13


  
BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY | 2016 FORM 10-K
----------------------------+---------------


 
 In 2010, the EPA set GHG emissions thresholds to define when permits under the CAA Permitting Requirements are required for new and existing industrial facilities (the “2010 Tailoring Rule”). Emissions from small farms, restaurants, and all but the very largest commercial facilities are not covered by the 2010 Tailoring Rule. The 2010 Tailoring Rule established a schedule that: (i) initially focused on the largest stationary sources with the most CAA permitting experience, (ii) then expanded to cover the largest stationary sources of GHG that may not have been previously covered by the CAA for other pollutants, and (iii) finally described the EPA’s plan for any additional steps in this process. Without this tailoring rule, the lower emissions thresholds would have taken effect automatically for GHGs in 2011, leading to dramatic increases in the number of required permits. The EPA implemented the 2010 Tailoring Rule in phases.
  
 In May 2016, the EPA updated New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) by setting emission limits for methane, covering additional sources, such as hydraulically fractured oil wells, and requiring owners/operators to find and repair leaks. The EPA also updated the Source Determination rules to clarify when multiple pieces of equipment and activities must be deemed a single source when determining whether major source permitting programs apply.
  
 Although we are not currently subject to reporting requirements under GHG-related regulations, the future adoption of any regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from the Nixon Facility could require us to incur significant costs and expenses or changes in operations, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
  
  Renewable Fuels
  
 Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA issued Renewable Fuels Standards (“RFS”) that require the blending of biofuels into transportation fuel. Since the compliance mechanism for RFS - Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) – would have created a burden on the Nixon Facility related to its NRLM production through 2014, we applied for an extension of the temporary exemption afforded small refineries through December 31, 2010 under the CAA Section 211(o)(9)(B). In 2014, the EPA granted the Nixon Facility a small refinery exemption from RFS requirements for 2013 and 2014. We ceased production of NRLM, a transportation-related diesel fuel product in 2014.  In 2014, we began producing HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product.
 Hazardous Waste
  
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes strict, joint and several liability on responsible parties with uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites, as well as accidents, spills, and other emergency releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment. The law authorizes two kinds of response actions: (i) short-term removals, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response, and (ii) long-term remedial response actions, that permanently and significantly reduce the dangers associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances that are serious, but not immediately life threatening. As of the filing of this Annual Report, neither we nor any of our predecessors have been designated as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute.
  
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state and local laws impose requirements related to the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Our refining operations generate petroleum product wastes, solid wastes, and ordinary industrial wastes, such as from paint and solvents, that are regulated under RCRA and state law. Certain wastes generated by the Nixon Facility are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes, but are subject to non-hazardous waste regulations. In the future, these wastes could be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and therefore may become subject to more rigorous and costly requirements.
  
 The Nixon Facility has been used for refining activities for many years. Although prior owners and operators may have used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and various wastes may have been released on or under the Nixon Facility site. A 2008 third-party environmental study determined that petroleum hydrocarbon and VOC concentrations were below Tier 1 protective concentration levels (“PCLs”). However, RCRA-8 metals were found to be above Tier 1 PCLs. An additional third-party study determined that metal concentrations from the soil would not leach beyond groundwater concentrations exceeding their respective PCLs. As a result, groundwater resources would not be threatened and no further reporting was required.

 Water Discharges
  
 Stormwater from the Nixon Facility is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable stormwater permits. Process wastewater from the Nixon Facility is tested and discharged to a nearby municipal treatment facility pursuant to applicable process wastewater permits. Wastewater from our offshore facilities, including our oil and natural gas pipelines and anchor platform, are tested and discharged pursuant to applicable produced water permits.
 Spill Prevention and Control
  
 The federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and stringent controls on the discharge of pollutants, including oil, into federal and state waters. These laws affect our crude oil and condensate processing operations and petroleum storage and terminaling operations, as well as our pipeline, facilities, and exploration and production assets. The CWA prohibits the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters except as authorized by the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a state agency with delegated authority. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements mandate the use of structures, such as berms and other secondary containment, to prevent hydrocarbons or other pollutants from reaching a jurisdictional body of water in the event of a spill or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA or analogous state laws and regulations.
  
 The EPA covers inland oil spills. In 2015, the EPA published a final rule expanding the definition of “Waters of the United States” under the CWA. The final rule did not expand federal jurisdiction. However, the final rule identified waters that are specifically excluded from jurisdiction, including, among others, depressions incidental to mining or construction that may become filled with water, puddles, groundwater, and stormwater control features constructed to convey, treat, or store stormwater on dry land. See “Offshore Safety and Environmental Oversight” within this governmental regulation section for information on oil spills that occur in coastal waters.
  
  Offshore Safety and Environmental Oversight
  
 In addition to the CAA, our pipeline, exploration and production assets are also subject to the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (the “OCSLA”). The OCSLA is administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the “BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (the “BSEE”) and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (“ONRR”). The BOEM manages the nation's offshore resources in an environmentally and economically responsible way, including leasing, plan administration, environmental studies, National Environmental Policy Act analysis, resource evaluation, economic analysis, and the Renewable Energy Program. The BSEE enforces safety and environmental regulations, including permitting and research, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response, and training and environmental compliance functions. Regarding oil spill response, the BSEE has partnered with the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”). In the event of an oil spill, the BSEE is responsible for monitoring and directing all efforts related to securing the source of the spill and re-establishing control over the facility. The USCG is responsible for monitoring and directing all efforts to mitigate a spill’s impact on the water, shoreline, or economic centers that could be impacted, as well as recovering any oil that has spilled. In recent years, the BOEM and the BSEE have been more aggressive in proposing and implementing several reforms to offshore oil and gas regulations.
  
  Spill Liability. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the “OPA”) and the CWA, in connection with the OCSLA, impose liability on owners or operators of vessels and facilities that discharge oil into the navigable waters of the U.S., adjoining shorelines, waters of the contiguous zone, or when the discharge may affect natural resources of the U.S. With limited exceptions, responsible parties are liable for all removal costs and damages arising from oil spills. Damages may include: injury or economic losses resulting from destruction of real or personal property, damages or loss of use of natural resources used for subsistence, lost tax revenue, royalties, rents, or net profit shares suffered by federal, state, or local governments due to injury to real or personal property, lost profits or impaired earning power because of injury to real or personal property or natural resources, and the net costs of providing increased or additional public services during or after removal activities.

 In 2015, the BOEM increased the offshore limit of liability for damages under the OPA from $75 million to $133.65 million, plus all clean-up costs, to reflect the significant increase in the Consumer Price Index. The onshore facilities limit of liability for damages under the OPA is $350 million plus all clean-up costs. A party cannot take advantage of the liability limits if the spill is caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from a violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations. If a party fails to report a spill or cooperate in the clean-up, liability limits do not apply.
  
 The OPA requires responsible parties to provide proof of financial responsibility for potential spills. The evidence of financial responsibility amount required is $35 million for certain types of offshore facilities located seaward of the seaward boundary of a state, including properties used for oil transportation. The BOEM’s 2015 regulatory change did not affect the ongoing required coverage amount. We currently maintain the statutory $35 million coverage.
  
  Spill Response. Pursuant to the OPA, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan, provides a blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The National Contingency Plan requires, among other things, that responsible parties have an oil spill response plan in place. We have an oil spill response plan in place.
  
  Decommissioning Requirements. To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM generally requires that lessees and rights-of-way holders demonstrate financial strength and reliability per regulations or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied, unless the BOEM exempts the lessee or rights-of-way holder from such financial assurance requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning and removing platforms and pipelines at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by the BOEM.
  
 In 2014, the BOEM issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining proposed changes to financial assurance requirements to modernize financial assurance and risk management and better address potential costs and liabilities of offshore energy development. Part of the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes the BOEM revising its supplemental bonding procedures by shifting from the current “waiver” model for self-insurance to a credit based model. In July 2016, the BOEM issued NTL No. 2016– N01, Notice to Lessees and Operators of Federal Oil and Gas, and Sulfur Leases, and Holders of Pipeline Right-of-Way and Right-of-Use and Easement Grants in the Outer Continental Shelf—Requiring Additional Security (“NTL 2016-N01”). NTL 2016-N01 outlines new criteria that will be used to determine the financial ability of a lessee, right-of-way holder, or right-of-use and easement holder to carry out its obligations, and addresses the possibility of individually tailoring a plan to enable the lessee, right-of-way holder, or right-of-use and easement holder to use one or more forms of security other than surety bonds and pledges of treasury securities and/or to phase-in compliance with the additional security requirement pursuant to such a plan. Lessees will no longer be granted waivers from the additional security obligations, and the BOEM is discontinuing the policy of considering the combined strength and reliability of co-lessees when determining a lessee’s additional security requirements. NTL 2016-N01 became effective in September 2016. In 2016, the BSEE issued NTL 2016-N03, Reporting Requirements for Decommissioning Expenditures on the OCS (“NTL 2016-N03”). Issued in April 2016, NTL 2016-N03 provides guidance and clarification regarding submission of certified decommissioning cost expenditure summaries following permanent plugging of any well, removal of any platform or other facility, and clearance of any site.
  
 The BOEM is requiring that we provide additional supplemental bonds or acceptable financial assurance of approximately $4.2 million for existing pipeline rights-of-way. We are currently working with the BOEM to develop a tailored plan to address the financial assurance requirements, particularly considering existing permit requests to abandon-in-place certain of our pipeline assets. There can be no assurance that the BOEM will accept a reduced amount of supplemental financial assurance or not require additional supplemental pipeline bonds related to our existing pipeline rights-of-way. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM.

  Offshore Safety. In 2010, the BSEE issued The Workplace Safety Rule, which requires operators to employ a comprehensive safety and environmental management system (“SEMS”).  Revisions to SEMS (“SEMS II”), which added several requirements to the original SEMS, became effective in 2013. The purpose of SEMS II is to reduce human and organizational errors as root causes of work-related accidents and offshore spills, develop protocols as to who at the facility has the ultimate operational safety and decision-making authority, and establish procedures to provide all personnel with “stop work” authority. SEMS II must be periodically audited by an independent third party auditor approved by the BSEE. We have a SEMS II plan in place.
  
  Health, Safety and Maintenance
  
 We are subject to several federal and state laws and regulations related to the health and safety of workers pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. These laws and regulations are administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (the “OSHA”) and, in states not participating in OSHA-approved state safety plans, comparable state regulatory bodies.
  
 Our refinery operations are also subject to OSHA process safety management regulations. In 2007, the OSHA launched the National Emphasis Program for Petroleum Refineries (the “RNEP”), which requires that refineries be inspected for compliance with process safety management regulations. Under RNEP, The Nixon Facility is subject to inspections under RNEP. Inspections may last from two to six months, including one to three months onsite. Inspectors primarily focus on process safety management implementation and recordkeeping.
  
 The Nixon Facility was inspected by OSHA in 2013 and again in June 2016. Following the 2013 inspection, we were assessed a civil penalty of $38,500. Following the 2016 inspection, we were assessed a civil penalty of $6,006. Citations issued by OSHA primarily related to failure to comply with documentation and notice posting requirements.
  
 We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by personnel at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely monitor our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
