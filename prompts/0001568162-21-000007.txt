Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are an externally managed real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) focusing on acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of primarily service-oriented and traditional retail and distribution related commercial real estate properties located primarily in the United States. Our assets consist primarily of freestanding single-tenant properties that are net leased to “investment grade” and other creditworthy tenants and a portfolio of multi-tenant retail properties consisting primarily of power centers and lifestyle centers. We intend to focus our future acquisitions primarily on net leased, single-tenant service retail properties, defined as properties leased to tenants in the retail banking, restaurant, grocery, pharmacy, gas, convenience, fitness, and auto services sectors. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 920 properties, comprised of 19.3 million rentable square feet, which were 93.9% leased, including 887 single-tenant net leased commercial properties (849 of which are leased to retail tenants) and 33 multi-tenant retail properties. Based on annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2020, the total single-tenant properties comprised 70% of our total portfolio and were 60% leased to service retail tenants, and the total multi-tenant properties comprised 30% of our total portfolio and were 50% leased to experiential retail tenants, defined as tenants in the restaurant, discount retail, entertainment, salon/beauty and grocery sectors, among others.
Investment Strategy
In addition to focusing on acquiring a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate properties with the tenants and other attributes noted above we also focus on:
•acquiring and owning service-oriented retail properties or experiential retail tenants that we believe are more resistant to e-commerce and the factors impacting traditional retail;
•maintaining high portfolio occupancy with a balance of service retail single-tenant assets featuring long-term leases;
•targeting a leverage level of not more than 45% loan-to-value at the time of acquisition; and
•maintaining diversity by tenant as well as a geographic location and lease term.
There is no limit on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire. The number and mix of properties depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition of properties. 
Since we acquired all of the multi-tenant properties in our portfolio in February 2017 in our merger with American Realty Capital - Retail Centers of America, Inc. which was sponsored and advised by affiliates of American Finance Advisors, LLC (the “Advisor”), we have not acquired any additional multi-tenant properties. We do not currently intend to acquire additional multi-tenant properties in the future. Moreover, pursuant to the provisions in our revolving unsecured corporate credit facility (our “Credit Facility”), we are prohibited from acquiring additional multi-tenant properties until after March 31, 2021. We may also acquire or own properties through joint ventures with third parties although we do not presently have any of these arrangements. We do not intend to develop or redevelop properties. In evaluating prospective investments, our Advisor considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting it, the creditworthiness of its major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans (secured by real estate) but do not currently own any of these asset types. Our Advisor has substantial discretion to select specific investments, subject to approval by our board of directors, including any related guidelines. 
Tenants and Leasing
We seek to lease space at our properties to “investment grade” rated tenants. For our purposes, “investment grade” includes both tenants (or lease guarantors) with actual investment grade ratings or tenants with “implied” investment grade ratings. Implied investment grade may include the actual rating of a tenant’s parent or the guarantor of the parent (regardless of whether the parent has guaranteed the tenant’s obligation under the lease) or tenants that are identified as investment grade by using a proprietary Moody’s analytical tool which generates an implied rating by measuring an entity’s probability of default. Based on annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2020, approximately 61.5% of the tenants in our single-tenant portfolio were considered “investment grade” consisting of 50.4% with actual investment grade ratings and 11.1% with implied investment grade ratings, and approximately 31.2% of the anchor tenants in our multi-tenant portfolio were considered “investment grade” consisting of 20.2% with actual investment grade ratings and 11.0% with implied investment grade ratings. 
We do not have any leases or contracts with governmental entities. We also seek to maintain high occupancy rates through long-term leases. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 93.9% occupied.
Our business is generally not seasonal.
Financing Strategies and Policies 
We use various sources to fund our business, including acquisitions and other investments as well as property and tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. These sources have recently consisted of: (1) equity offerings of common and preferred stock; (2) property-level financing secured by the underlying property or properties; and (3) draws on our revolving unsecured corporate credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with BMO Harris Bank N.A.. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein for a discussion of how we have funded our capital needs. We expect to raise additional equity capital and borrow additional monies in the future to fund our capital needs, including future acquisitions. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, these types of transactions in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. See Note 7 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. We may reevaluate and change our investing or financing policies in our board’s sole discretion.
COVID-19 Update
As discussed, in more detail in other sections of this Annual Report, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, us and our operations. Because of the rigorous underwriting standards used by our Advisor and our focus on credit worthy tenants, we collected 99%, 87%, 93% and 96% of cash rent due for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as of February 15, 2021. In addition, we collected 99% of cash rent due for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 from our top 20 tenants, 99% from our single-tenant portfolio and 88% from our multi-tenant portfolio (based on annualized rental income on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2020). For additional information on our rent collection efforts, including deferral or abatement agreements, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis -Management Update on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
Organizational Structure
Substantially all of our business is conducted through American Finance Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “OP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our Advisor manages our day-to-day business with the assistance of our property manager, American Finance Properties, LLC (the “Property Manager”). Our Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments LLC (“AR Global”) and these related parties receive compensation and fees for providing services to us. We also reimburse these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services to us.
Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and have operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but can provide no assurance that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a REIT. To continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)), determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
Competition
The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We compete for tenants in all of our markets based on various factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to a tenant’s needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 
In addition, we compete for acquisitions with other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, mutual funds, and other entities. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater financial resources than we have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants.
Competition from these and other third-party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase prices, which will lower yields, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. 
Regulations - General
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Regulations - Environmental 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future. We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase. 
Human Capital Resources
We are an externally managed company and thus have no employees. We have retained the Advisor pursuant to a long-term advisory contract to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. We have also entered into agreements with our Property Manager to manage and lease our properties. The employees of the Advisor, Property Manager, and their respective affiliates perform a full range of services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, investor relations and all general administrative services. We depend on the Advisor and the Property Manager for services that are essential to us. If the Advisor and the Property Manager were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide these services ourselves or obtain them from other sources.
