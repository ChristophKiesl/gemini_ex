ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
LKQ Corporation ("LKQ" or the "Company") is a leading provider of alternative and specialty parts to repair and accessorize automobiles and other vehicles. LKQ has operations in North America, Europe and Taiwan. LKQ offers its customers a broad range of replacement systems, components, equipment and parts to repair and accessorize automobiles, trucks, and recreational and performance vehicles.
Buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"); new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are sometimes referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. Collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new OEM products as alternative parts.
Specialty automotive and RV aftermarket accessories and equipment are purchased by consumers to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of their vehicles.
We are organized into five operating segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; Glass and Self Service. We aggregate our Wholesale - North America, Glass and Self Service operating segments into one reportable segment, North America, resulting in three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Specialty. See Note 14, "Segment and Geographic Information" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information by reportable segment and by geographic region.
HISTORY
LKQ was initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. We subsequently expanded through internal development and over 235 acquisitions of aftermarket, recycled, refurbished, and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers; self service retail businesses; specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers; and a distributor of automotive glass products. Our most significant acquisitions include:

• | 2007 acquisition of Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc., which, at the time of acquisition, was the leading domestic distributor of aftermarket products, including collision replacement products, paint products, refurbished steel bumpers, bumper covers and alloy wheels.


• | 2011 acquisition of Euro Car Parts Holdings Limited ("ECP"), a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company operating in the United Kingdom. This acquisition allowed us to expand our operations into the European automotive aftermarket business.


• | 2013 acquisition of Sator Beheer B.V. ("Sator"), a vehicle mechanical aftermarket parts distribution company based in the Netherlands, with operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France. This acquisition allowed us to further expand our geographic presence into continental Europe.


• | 2014 acquisition of Keystone Automotive Holdings, Inc. (“Keystone Specialty”), which expanded our product offering and increased our addressable market to include specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories.


• | 2016 acquisition of Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts Italia S.p.A. (“Rhiag”), a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles in Italy, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Poland and Spain. This acquisition expanded LKQ’s geographic presence in continental Europe.


• | 2016 acquisition of Pittsburgh Glass Works LLC (“PGW”), which performs wholesale and retail distribution services and automotive glass manufacturing. The acquisition expanded our addressable market in North America and globally. In December 2016, we reached an agreement to sell the glass manufacturing business of PGW; the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. The continuing portion of PGW’s business related to wholesale and retail distribution services is included in our North America reportable segment as of December 31, 2016.

Further information regarding our recent acquisitions is included in Note 2, "Business Combinations" and information related to our discontinued operations is included in Note 3, “Discontinued Operations” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
STRATEGY
Our strategy is to build economic value for our stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading source for alternative collision and mechanical repair products, and by expanding into other product lines and businesses that may benefit from our operating strengths. We strive to offer our customers the most comprehensive, available and cost effective selection of 
4

part solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. We believe a supply network with a broad inventory of quality alternative collision and mechanical repair products and specialty vehicle aftermarket products, high fulfillment rates, and superior customer service provides us with a competitive advantage. To execute our strategy, we are focused on the following key areas:

• | Extensive in-place network. We have invested significant capital to develop a network of alternative and specialty vehicle parts facilities across our operating segments. Additionally, our ability to move inventory throughout our distribution networks increases the availability of our products and also helps us to fill a higher percentage of our customers’ requests. In order to expand our distribution network, we will continue to seek to grow into new markets and to improve penetration through acquisitions. We will continue to seek opportunities to leverage the distribution network by delivering more parts through our existing network in our North America and Specialty operations. In our Europe segment, we are attempting to implement the same strategy as our North America operations to build a Pan-European distribution network.


• | Acquisitions. We have focused on growth through acquisitions both domestically and abroad. The primary objective of our acquisitions is to expand our presence to new or adjacent markets, to expand into other product lines and business that may benefit from our operating strengths, and to increase the size of our addressable market. When we identify potential acquisitions, we attempt to target companies with a leading market presence, an experienced management team and workforce that provide a fit with our existing operations, and strong cash flows. After completing an acquisition, we focus on integrating the company with our existing business to provide additional value to the combined entity through cost savings and synergies, such as logistics cost synergies resulting from integration with our existing distribution network, administrative cost savings, shared procurement, and cross-selling opportunities.


• | Strong business relationships. We have developed business relationships with key constituents, including automobile insurance companies, suppliers and other industry participants in North America and Europe.


• | Broad product offering. The breadth and depth of our inventory across all of our operating segments reinforces LKQ’s ability to provide a “one-stop” solution for our customers’ alternative vehicle replacement, maintenance, and specialty vehicle product needs.


• | High fulfillment rates. We manage local inventory levels to improve delivery and maximize customer service. Improving local order fulfillment rates reduces transfer costs and delivery times, and improves customer satisfaction.


• | Technology driven business processes. We focus on technology development as a way to support our competitive advantage. We believe that we can more cost effectively leverage our data to make better business decisions than our smaller competitors.

NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT
Our North America segment is composed of wholesale operations, which consists of aftermarket and salvage operations, and self service retail operations. We are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and a leading provider of alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the U.S. and Canada. 
Wholesale Operations
Inventory
Our wholesale automobile product operations in North America sell all five product types (aftermarket, recycled, remanufactured, refurbished and OEM parts) to professional collision and mechanical automobile repair businesses. Our principal aftermarket product types consist of those most frequently damaged in collisions, including bumper covers, automotive body panels, lights and automotive glass products such as windshields. Platinum Plus is our exclusive product line offered under the Keystone brand of aftermarket products. Certain of our products are certified by independent organizations such as the Certified Automotive Parts Association (“CAPA”) and NSF International (“NSF”). CAPA and NSF are associations that evaluate the quality of aftermarket collision replacement products compared to OEM collision replacement products. We also developed a product line called "Value Line" for more value conscious, often self-pay, consumers. Our salvage products include both mechanical and collision parts, including engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products such as trunk lids, fenders and hoods; lights; and bumper assemblies. 
The aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from independent manufacturers and distributors located primarily in the U.S., Taiwan, and China. In 2016, approximately 39% of our aftermarket purchases were made from our top four vendors, with our largest vendor providing approximately 16% of our annual inventory purchases. We believe we are one of the largest customers of each of these suppliers. Outside of this group, no other supplier provided more than 5% of our supply of aftermarket products in 2016. We purchased approximately 48% of our aftermarket products in 2016 directly from 
5

manufacturers in Taiwan and other Asian countries. Approximately 50% of our aftermarket products were purchased from vendors located in the U.S. and Canada; however, we believe the majority of these products were manufactured in Taiwan, Mexico or other foreign countries. 
We procure recycled products for our wholesale operations by acquiring total loss vehicles, typically sold at regional salvage auctions, and then dismantling and inventorying the parts. The availability and pricing of the salvage vehicles we procure for our wholesale recycled products operations may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the production level of new vehicles and the portion of damaged vehicles declared total losses. Our bidding specialists are equipped with a proprietary software application that allows our bidding specialist to compare the vehicles at the salvage auctions against our current inventory levels, historical demand, and recent average selling prices to arrive at an estimated maximum bid.
Within our wholesale operations, we focus our procurement on products that are in the most demand, based on a number of factors such as historical sales records of vehicles by model and year, customer requests, projections of future supply and demand trends. Because lead times may take 40 days or more on imported aftermarket products, sales volume and in-stock inventory are important factors in the procurement process.
In our aftermarket operations, we use a third party enterprise management system and other third party software packages to leverage the centralized data and information that a single system provides, such as a data warehouse to conduct enhanced analytics and reporting, an integrated budgeting system, an electronic data interchange tool, and E-commerce tools to enhance our online business-to-business initiatives - OrderKeystone.com and Keyless. 
Our wholesale recycled product locations in North America operate an internally-developed, proprietary enterprise management system called LKQX. We believe that the use of a single system across all of our wholesale recycled product operations helps facilitate the sales process, allows for continued implementation of standard operating procedures, and yields improved training efficiency, employee transferability, access to our national inventory database, management reporting and data storage. The system also supports an electronic exchange process for identifying and locating parts at other select recyclers and facilitates brokered sales to fill customer orders for items not in stock. 
Scrap and Other Materials
Our salvage operations generate scrap metal and other materials that we sell to metals recyclers. Vehicles that have been dismantled for recycled products and "crush only" end-of-life vehicles acquired from other companies are typically crushed using equipment on site. In other cases, we will hire mobile crushing equipment to crush the vehicles before they are transported to shredders and scrap metal processors. Damaged and unusable wheel cores are melted in our aluminum furnace and sold to consumers of aluminum ingot and sow for the production of various automotive products, including wheels. We also extract and sell the precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts such as catalytic converters.
Customers
We sell our products to wholesale customers that include collision and mechanical repair shops and new and used car dealerships, as well as to retail customers. The majority of these customers tend to be individually-owned small businesses, although the number of independent and dealer-operated collision repair facilities has declined over the last decade, as regional or national multiple location operators have increased their geographic presence through acquisitions. Automobile insurance companies affect the demand for our collision products; while insurance companies do not pay for our products directly, they ultimately pay for the repair costs of insured vehicles in excess of any deductible amount. As a result, insurance companies often influence the types of products used in a repair. The use of our products provides a direct benefit to insurance companies by lowering the cost of repairs, decreasing the time required to return the repaired vehicle to the customer, and providing a replacement product that is of high quality and comparable performance to the part replaced. 
Our sales personnel are encouraged to promote LKQ to customers as a “one-stop shop” by offering comparable options from our other product lines if the desired part isn’t in stock. To support these efforts, we have provided our sales staff with access to both recycled and aftermarket sales systems, and we have developed sales incentive programs that encourage cross selling throughout our wholesale operations.
To better serve our customers, a consolidated approach has been taken for the electronic sale of wholesale products in our North American Segment. A full suite of E-commerce services is available to approved partners that helps us improve order accuracy, reduce return rate and better fit our customer workflow. Using these services in coordination with our partners, products can be searched, priced and ordered without leaving the customers' own operating systems.
Distribution
We have a distribution network of warehouses and cross dock facilities, which allows us to develop and maintain our service levels with local repair shops while providing fulfillment rates that are made possible by our nationwide presence. Our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes, and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs. Our local presence allows us to provide daily deliveries as required by our customers, using drivers who 
6

routinely deliver to the same customers. Our sales force and local delivery drivers develop and maintain critical personal relationships with the local repair shops that benefit from access to our wide selection of products, which we are able to offer as a result of our regional inventory network. We operate a delivery fleet of medium-sized trucks and smaller trucks and vans, which deliver multiple product types on the same delivery routes to help minimize distribution costs and improve customer service. 
Competition
We consider all suppliers of vehicle collision and mechanical products to be competitors, including aftermarket suppliers, recycling businesses, refurbishing operations, parts remanufacturers, OEMs and internet-based suppliers. We compete with alternative parts distributors on the basis of our nationwide distribution system, our product lines and inventory availability, customer service, our relationships with insurance companies, and to a lesser extent, price; we compete with OEMs primarily on the basis of price and, to a lesser extent, on service and product quality. We do not consider retail chains that focus on the do-it-yourself market to be our direct competitors since many of our wholesale product sales are paid for by insurance companies rather than the end user. 
Self Service Operations
Our self service retail operations, most of which operate under the name “LKQ Pick Your Part,” sell parts from end-of-life vehicles directly to consumers. In addition to revenue from the sale of parts, core, and scrap, we charge a nominal admission fee to access the property. 
Inventory
We acquire inventory for our self service retail product operations from a variety of sources, including but not limited to towing companies, auctions, the general public, municipality sales, insurance carriers, and charitable organizations. We typically procure salvage vehicles that are more than seven model years old for our self service retail product operations; these vehicles are generally older and of lower quality than the salvage vehicles we purchase for our wholesale recycled product operations. Vehicles are delivered to our locations by the seller, or we arrange for transportation. Once on our property, minimal labor is required to process the vehicle other than removing the battery, fluids, refrigerants, catalytic converters and hazardous materials. The extracted fluids are stored in bulk and subsequently sold to recyclers; in the case of gasoline, the fuel retrieved is primarily used to power our delivery vehicles. Vehicles are then placed in the yard for customers to remove parts. In our self service business, availability of a specific part will depend on which vehicles are currently at the site and to what extent parts may have been previously sold. We usually keep a vehicle at our facility for 30 to 120 days, depending on the capacity of the yard and size of the market, before it is crushed and sold to scrap metal processors. 
Scrap and Other Materials
Our self service operations generate scrap metal, alloys and other materials that we sell to recyclers. Vehicles that we no longer make available to the public and "crush only" vehicles acquired from other companies, including OEMs, are typically crushed using equipment on site.
Customers
The customers of our self service yards are frequently do-it-yourself mechanics, small independent repair shops servicing older vehicles, auto rebuilders, and resellers. The scrap from the vehicle hulks, when not processed by us, is sold to metals recyclers, with whom we may also compete when procuring salvage vehicles for our operations.
Competition
There are competitors operating self service businesses in all of the markets in which we operate. In some markets, there are numerous competitors, often operating in close proximity to our operations. We try to differentiate our business by the quality of the inventory and the size and cleanliness of the property.
EUROPE SEGMENT
As noted in the History section, the Europe segment was built on three key acquisitions: ECP (2011), Sator (2013) and Rhiag (2016). Our Rhiag acquisition provides a potential platform to capitalize on the large and fragmented aftermarket mechanical replacement parts market in Europe, and also complements our existing operations in the U.K. and the Benelux region given the significant overlap in suppliers and product mix, which allows for potential cost savings from the leveraging of our combined purchasing power. In 2014, we expanded our European segment to include wholesale recycling operations through our acquisition of a business with salvage and vehicle repair facilities in Sweden and Norway. In addition to expanding our geographic presence in Europe, we believe these acquisitions provide us with the opportunity to leverage our experience in operating salvage facilities in a new market and to expand our aftermarket operations to include these countries. In December 2016, we acquired an equity investment in Mekonomen AB ("Mekonomen"), the leading independent car parts and service 
7

chain in the Nordic region of Europe. Mekonomen will remain independent of our existing European operations, but we plan to explore areas where the companies can work together in a mutually beneficial manner. We have acquired many smaller businesses within these regions and over time, we anticipate further integration of our European operations as we optimize purchasing, warehousing, cataloging, logistics and back-office functions. 
Inventory
Our inventory is primarily composed of mechanical aftermarket parts for the repair of vehicles 3 to 15 years old. Our top selling products include brake pads; discs and sensors; clutches; electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries; steering and suspension products; filters; and oil and automotive fluids. In addition to mechanical aftermarket parts, we also sell collision parts in our Europe operations. We believe the historically low alternative collision parts usage percentage in Europe provides an opportunity for us in this segment, particularly as insurance companies look to lower their costs. 
In 2016, our top five suppliers represented 22% of our aftermarket inventory purchases, with each of our top two suppliers representing approximately 6% of our purchases. No other suppliers comprised a significant portion of our purchases during 2016. The aftermarket products we distribute are purchased from vendors located primarily in the U.K. and continental Europe. In 2016, we purchased 92% of our products from companies in Europe. The remaining 8% of our 2016 purchases were sourced from vendors located primarily in China or Taiwan, some of which also supply collision parts for our Wholesale - North America operations. In 2016, 57%, 29%, and 8% of our total inventory purchases were made in Euros, Pounds Sterling, and U.S Dollars, respectively.
Our aftermarket operations in the U.K. use a single integrated IT platform for our purchasing, branch stock, and finance activities, which are further supported by a national distribution center system to manage inventory movement. The IT system allows customers to identify the correct part for repairs, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing return rates. Our aftermarket operations in continental Europe use several IT systems, which are linked to transfer data between systems, to manage customer orders and inventory movement, and for financial reporting purposes. Certain of our IT systems can interface with our repair shop customers' respective IT systems, which enables them to identify the part required for the repair.
In our Scandinavia operations, we purchase severely damaged or totaled vehicles from insurance companies, which are transferred to our dismantling facilities or sold to other third party dismantlers.
Customers
We operate under both two-step (i.e. direct sales to customers) and three-step (i.e. sales to distributors who in turn sell to customers) distribution models in Europe. In our two-step operations, such as the UK and Czech Republic, we sell the majority of our products to commercial customers primarily consisting of professional repairers, including both independent mechanical repair shops and collision repair shops. In our three-step operations, such as Italy, Belgium and Switzerland, we sell products to wholesale distributors or jobbers. Historically, our distribution network in the Benelux Region operated under a three-step distribution model where the immediate customers were warehouse distributors. Since the second quarter of 2014, we have acquired a number of aftermarket parts distributors in the Netherlands, which has enabled us to transform the original distribution model in this region to a two-step distribution model. In addition to our sales to repair shops and wholesale distributors, we generate a portion of our revenue through sales to retail customers from ECP’s e-commerce platform and from counter sales at the branch locations. 
Distribution
Our European operations employ a distribution model in which inventory is stored at regional distribution centers or hubs, with fast moving product stored at branch locations or at local warehouse distributors (for some of our Netherlands, Italy and Check Republic operations) for timely delivery to the repair shop customers. Product is moved through the distribution network on our vans or via common carrier. In our U.K. operations, we also sometimes employ a third party motorcycle fleet to deliver parts from our branch locations to nearby repair shop customers. 
In the U.K., we have undertaken a major project to expand our distribution capabilities by building a new national distribution center in Tamworth, which is expected to be completed in 2018. Between now and completion, we will incur some duplicate operating and other start-up costs, which may be material, as a result of having multiple warehouses during the build out phase. 
Competition
We view all suppliers of replacement repair products as our competitors, including other alternative parts suppliers and OEMs and their dealer networks. While we compete with all alternative parts suppliers, there are few with national distribution networks like ours that can reach the majority of repair shop customers within the required delivery time in their respective markets. We believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other alternative parts suppliers primarily through our distribution network, efficient stock management systems and proprietary technology which allows us to deliver our products 
8

quickly, as well as through our product lines and inventory availability, pricing, and service. We compete with OEMs primarily on the basis of price, service and availability.
SPECIALTY SEGMENT
Our Specialty operating segment was formed in 2014 with our acquisition of Keystone Specialty, a leading distributor and marketer of specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories in North America. Our Specialty operations reach most major markets in the U.S. and Canada and serve the following six product segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; RV; towing; wheels, tires and performance handling; and miscellaneous accessories. 
Inventory
The specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories we distribute are purchased from suppliers located primarily in the U.S., Canada, and China. Our top selling products are RV appliances & air conditioners, towing hitches, truck bed covers, vehicle protection products, cargo management products, and wheels, tires & suspension products. Specialty aftermarket suppliers are typically small to medium-sized, independent businesses that focus on a narrow product or market niche. Due to the highly fragmented supplier base for specialty vehicle aftermarket products, we have limited supplier concentration. In 2016, approximately 24% of our specialty vehicle aftermarket purchases were made from our top five suppliers, with our largest vendor providing approximately 8% of our annual inventory purchases.
Our Specialty operations utilize an internally developed inventory management and order entry system that interfaces with third party software systems for accounting, transaction processing, data analytics, and reporting. 
Customers
Overall, the specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and accessories market contains a fragmented customer base composed of RV and specialty automotive dealers, installers, jobbers, builders, parts chains, and mail-order businesses. Our customers are principally small, independent businesses. These customers depend on us to provide a broad range of products, rapid delivery, marketing support and technical assistance. In addition to traditional customers, in recent years we have increased sales to several large parts and accessory online retailers. Our Specialty segment also operates retail stores in northeast Pennsylvania. 
We promote our products to customers through marketing programs, which include: catalogs, advertising, sponsorships and promotional activities; product level marketing and merchandising support; and online initiatives. Our national footprint allows us to stage trade shows across the U.S., which provide an opportunity to improve sales through the showcasing of new and innovative products from our vendors to our customers.
Online sales of our Specialty products take place through our ekeystone.com and viantp.com sites. These sites provide customers (i) the ability to match products with the make and model of car thus allowing the customer to order the right part, (ii) the product information (e.g. pictures, attributes) available for review and (iii) the convenience of searching inventory availability and ordering the product on the site. Additionally, the site can provide sales opportunities by suggesting other parts to purchase based on an inquiry submitted by the customer.
Distribution
Our Specialty segment operations employ a hub-and-spoke distribution model which enables us to transport products from our primary distribution centers to our non-inventory stocking cross docks, a majority of which are co-located with our North America wholesale operations and provide distribution points to key regional markets and synergies with our existing infrastructure. We believe this provides added value to our customers through a broader product offering and more efficient distribution process. We use our delivery routes to provide multi-day per week delivery and returns of our products directly to and from our customers in all 48 continental U.S. states and 9 Canadian provinces, and we ship globally to customers in other countries. Our delivery fleet utilizes a third party software provider to optimize delivery routes, and to track the progress of delivery vehicles throughout their runs.
Competition
Industry participants have a variety of supply choices. Vendors can deliver products to market via warehouse distributors and mail order catalog businesses, or directly to retailers and/or consumers. We view all suppliers of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories as our competitors. While we compete with all specialty vehicle aftermarket parts suppliers, there are few with national distribution networks like LKQ’s that can reach the majority of customers within the optimum delivery time. We believe we have been able to distinguish ourselves from other specialty vehicle aftermarket parts and equipment suppliers primarily through our broad product selection, which encompasses both popular and hard-to-find products, our distribution network, and efficient inventory management systems, as well as through our service. We compete on the basis of product breadth and depth, rapid and dependable delivery, marketing initiatives, support services, and price.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We own various trade names and trademarks as a result of past acquisitions. In addition to acquired trade names and trademarks, we also have technology-based intellectual property that has been both internally developed and obtained through license agreements. We do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single or group of related trademarks, licenses or registrations, nor would the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property license agreement materially affect our business.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 42,500 persons, which includes approximately 3,000 persons employed by PGW's glass manufacturing business that we expect to sell in the first quarter of 2017. Of the approximately 39,500 employees of our continuing operations, approximately 20,500 were employed in North America and approximately 19,000 were employed outside of North America. Of our employees in North America associated with continuing operations, approximately 1,370 were represented by unions. Outside of North America, we have government-mandated collective bargaining agreements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where many of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
FACILITIES
Our continuing operations include 1,339 facilities, including 548 facilities in the U.S. and 791 facilities located in 20 other countries, most of which are leased. Many of our locations stock multiple product types or serve more than one function. 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 500 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois 60661. We operate a field support center in Nashville, Tennessee that performs certain centralized functions for our North American operations, including accounting, procurement, and information systems support; in 2017, we announced our plans to expand the size of our field support center via construction of a new 100,000 square foot facility in Nashville. Our Specialty operations maintain primary procurement, accounting and finance functions in Exeter, Pennsylvania. Certain back-office support functions for our segments are performed in Bangalore, India. Our European operations maintain procurement, accounting, and finance functions in Wembley, outside of London, England and Tamworth, England; in Schiedam, the Netherlands; in Milan, Italy; and in Prague, Czech Republic. In addition to these offices, we have a 500,000 square foot national distribution center in Tamworth that houses inventory to supply the hubs and branches of our U.K. operations. We are in the process of constructing a second national distribution center in Tamworth; we expect the 750,000 square foot facility will be fully operational by 2018. Additionally, we operate an aftermarket parts warehouse in Taiwan to aggregate inventory for shipment to our locations in North America. 
REGULATION
            Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the U.S. and the other countries in which we operate. See the risk factor “We are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the effects of environmental laws and regulations on us.
SEASONALITY
Our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs. Our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year, when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment. We expect our aftermarket glass operations to generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters, when the demand for glass replacements increases after the winter weather.
