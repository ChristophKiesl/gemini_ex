ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
EnerSys (the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) is a world leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications. We also manufacture and distribute energy systems solutions and motive power batteries, specialty batteries, battery chargers, power equipment, battery accessories and outdoor equipment enclosure solutions to customers worldwide. Energy Systems which combine enclosures, power conversion, power distribution and energy storage are used in the telecommunication and broadband, utility industries, uninterruptible power supplies, and numerous applications requiring stored energy solutions. Motive Power batteries and chargers are utilized in electric forklift trucks and other industrial electric powered vehicles. Specialty batteries are used in aerospace and defense applications, large over the road trucks, premium automotive and medical. We also provide aftermarket and customer support services to over 10,000 customers in more than 100 countries through a network of distributors, independent representatives and our internal sales force around the world.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company's chief operating decision maker, or CODM (the Company's Chief Executive Officer), changed the manner in which he reviews financial information for purposes of assessing business performance and allocating resources, by focusing on the lines of business on a global basis, rather than on geographic basis. As a result of this change, the Company re-evaluated the identification of its operating segments and reportable segments. The new operating segments were identified as Energy Systems, Motive Power and Specialty. The Company’s operating segments also represent its reportable segments under ASC 280, Segment Reporting. Therefore, the Company has changed its segment presentation from three reportable segments based on geographic basis to three reportable segments based on line of business. All prior comparative periods presented have been recast to reflect these changes.
The Company's three reportable segments, based on lines of business, are as follows:
•Energy Systems - uninterruptible power systems, or “UPS” applications for computer and computer-controlled systems, as well as telecommunications systems, switchgear and electrical control systems used in industrial facilities and electric utilities, large-scale energy storage and energy pipelines. Energy Systems also includes highly integrated power solutions and services to broadband, telecom, renewable and industrial customers, as well as thermally managed cabinets and enclosures for electronic equipment and batteries.
•Motive Power - power for electric industrial forklifts used in manufacturing, warehousing and other material handling applications as well as mining equipment, diesel locomotive starting and other rail equipment; and
•Specialty - premium starting, lighting and ignition applications in transportation, energy solutions for satellites, military aircraft, submarines, ships and other tactical vehicles as well as medical and security systems. 

See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on segment reporting.
Fiscal Year Reporting
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when we refer to our fiscal years, we state “fiscal” and the year, as in “fiscal 2021”, which refers to our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The Company reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31. The four quarters in fiscal 2021 ended on July 5, 2020, October 4, 2020, January 3, 2021, and March 31, 2021, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2020 ended on June 30, 2019, September 29, 2019, December 29, 2019, and March 31, 2020, respectively.
History
EnerSys and its predecessor companies have been manufacturers of industrial batteries for over 125 years. Morgan Stanley Capital Partners teamed with the management of Yuasa, Inc. in late 2000 to acquire from Yuasa Corporation (Japan) its reserve power and motive power battery businesses in North and South America. We were incorporated in October 2000 for the purpose of completing the Yuasa, Inc. acquisition. On January 1, 2001, we changed our name from Yuasa, Inc. to EnerSys to reflect our focus on the energy systems nature of our businesses.
In 2004, EnerSys completed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) and the Company’s common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the trading symbol “ENS”.
Key Developments
There have been several key stages in the development of our business, which explain to a significant degree our results of operations over the past several years.
In March 2002, we acquired the reserve power and motive power business of the Energy Storage Group of Invensys plc. (“ESGI”). Our successful integration of ESGI provided global scale in both the reserve and motive power markets. The ESGI acquisition also provided us with a further opportunity to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency.
During fiscal years 2003 through 2021, we made thirty-four acquisitions around the globe. There were no acquisitions in fiscal 2021 but in fiscal 2020, we completed the acquisition of NorthStar, headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden and in fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisition of Alpha. 
NorthStar Acquisition
On September 30, 2019, we completed the acquisition of NorthStar, for $77.8 million in cash consideration and the assumption of $107.0 million in debt, which was funded using existing cash and credit facilities. NorthStar, through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, manufactures and distributes thin plate pure lead (TPPL) batteries and battery enclosures. NorthStar has two large manufacturing facilities in Springfield, Missouri. 
The results of the NorthStar acquisition have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition. Pro forma earnings and earnings per share computations have not been presented as this acquisition was not considered material.
The results of operations of NorthStar have been included in our Energy Systems segment and Specialty segment, respectively.
Alpha Acquisition
On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “Alpha share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “Alpha asset acquisition” and together with the Alpha share purchase, the “Alpha acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in the comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The initial purchase consideration for the Alpha acquisition was $750.0 million of which $650.0 million was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing, in accordance with the purchase agreement. The 1,177,630 shares had a closing date fair value of $93.3 million, based upon the December 7, 2018 closing date spot rate of $79.20. The total purchase consideration, consisting of cash paid of $650.0 million, shares valued at $93.3 million and adjustment for working capital (due from seller of $0.8 million) was $742.5 million.
The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7. below).
The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Energy Systems segment beginning December 8, 2018. 
Our Customers
We serve over 10,000 customers in over 100 countries, on a direct basis or through our distributors. We are not overly dependent on any particular end market. Our customer base is highly diverse, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of our revenues.
Our Energy Systems customers consist of both global and regional customers. These customers are in diverse markets including telecom, UPS, electric utilities, security systems, emergency lighting, services to broadband, telecom, renewable and industrial customers, as well as thermally managed cabinets and enclosures for electronic equipment and batteries.
Our Motive Power products are sold to a large, diversified customer base. These customers include material handling equipment dealers, forklift and heavy truck original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and end users of such equipment. End users include manufacturers, distributors, warehouse operators, retailers, airports, mine operators and railroads. 
Our Specialty products are utilized in transportation, aerospace and defense markets. The products are sold globally to OEMs, distribution partners, vehicle fleets and directly to government entities such as the United States of America, Germany and the United Kingdom. 
Distribution and Services
We distribute, sell and service our products throughout the world, principally through company-owned sales and service facilities, as well as through independent manufacturers’ representatives. Our company-owned network allows us to offer high-quality service, including preventative maintenance programs and customer support. Our warehouses and service locations enable us to respond quickly to customers in the markets we serve. We believe that the extensive industry experience of our sales organization results in strong long-term customer relationships.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
We manufacture and assemble our products at manufacturing facilities located in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. With a view toward projected demand, we strive to optimize and balance capacity at our battery manufacturing facilities globally, while simultaneously minimizing our product cost. By taking a global view of our manufacturing requirements and capacity, we believe we are better able to anticipate potential capacity bottlenecks and equipment and capital funding needs.
The primary raw materials used to manufacture our products include lead, plastics, steel and copper. We purchase lead from a number of leading suppliers throughout the world. Because lead is traded on the world’s commodity markets and its price fluctuates daily, we periodically enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our projected requirements to reduce the volatility of our costs.
Competition
The industrial energy storage market is highly competitive both among competitors who manufacture and sell industrial batteries and other energy storage systems and solutions and among customers who purchase industrial energy solutions. Our competitors range from development stage companies to large domestic and international corporations. Certain of our competitors produce energy storage products utilizing technologies or chemistries different from our own. We compete primarily on the basis of reputation, product quality, reliability of service, delivery and price. We believe that our products and services are competitively priced.
Energy Systems
We compete principally with East Penn Manufacturing, Exide Technologies (Stryten), New Power, C&D Technologies Inc., Vertiv, ABB, Amphenol (Delta/Eltek), as well as Chinese producers.
Motive Power
Our primary global competitors in traditional lead-acid include East Penn Manufacturing, Exide Technologies (Stryten), Hoppecke, Eternity, Midac, Sunlight and TAB, as well as a number of domestic Chinese manufacturers. 

Additionally, while lithium-ion battery technology in the motive power space has traditionally been relegated to smaller material handling applications, we have seen the entrance of a number of companies into larger battery types, acting as lithium cell packagers or integrators of cells sourced primarily from Asia. The integrators include forklift original equipment manufacturers either directly or through partnership with other entities.
Specialty
We compete globally within the Transportation, Aerospace and Defense markets and specialized lithium technologies used in these critical applications. Our TPPL technology is a significant player in the applications using absorbed glass materials (AGM). Our major competitors in AGM technology are Clarios, East Penn Manufacturing, Exide Technologies (Stryten) Stryten, Fiamm, Banner and Atlas. In the Aerospace and Defense specialized markets our main competitors are Eagle Picher and SAFT.
Warranties
Warranties for our products vary geographically and by product type and are competitive with other suppliers of these types of products. Generally, our Energy Systems product warranties range from one to twenty years, our Motive Power product warranties range from one to seven years and from one to four years for Specialty transportation batteries. The length of our warranties is varied to reflect regional characteristics and competitive influences. In some cases, our warranty period may include a pro rata period, which is typically based around the design life of the product and the application served. Our warranties generally cover defects in workmanship and materials and are limited to specific usage parameters.
Intellectual Property
We have numerous patents and patent licenses in the United States and other jurisdictions but do not consider any one patent to be material to our business. From time to time, we apply for patents on new inventions and designs, but we believe that the growth of our business will depend primarily upon the quality of our products and our relationships with our customers, rather than the extent of our patent protection.
We believe we are the leader in TPPL. We believe that a significant capital investment would be required by any party desiring to produce products using TPPL technology for our markets.
We own or possess exclusive and non-exclusive licenses and other rights to use a number of trademarks in various jurisdictions. We have obtained registrations for many of these trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions. Our various trademark registrations currently have durations of approximately 10 to 20 years, varying by mark and jurisdiction of registration and may be renewable. We endeavor to keep all of our material registrations current. We believe that many such rights and licenses are important to our business by helping to develop strong brand-name recognition in the marketplace.
Seasonality
Our business generally does not experience significant quarterly fluctuations in net sales as a result of weather or other trends that can be directly linked to seasonality patterns, although transportation and power electronics can experience seasonality in colder months. Despite that, historically our fourth quarter is our best quarter with higher revenues and generally more working days while our second quarter is the weakest due to the summer holiday season in Western Europe and North America. 
Product and Process Development
Our product and process development efforts are focused on the creation of new stored energy products, and integrated power systems and controls. We allocate our resources to the following key areas:
•the design and development of new products;
•optimizing and expanding our existing product offering;
•waste and scrap reduction;
•production efficiency and utilization;
•capacity expansion without additional facilities; and
•quality attribute maximization.
Employees
At March 31, 2021, we had approximately 11,400 employees. Of these employees, approximately 27% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in the next twelve months were approximately 11% of the total workforce. The average term of these agreements is 2 years, with the longest term being 3.5 years. We consider our employee relations to be good. We did not experience any significant labor unrest or disruption of production during fiscal 2021.

Environmental Matters and Climate Change Impacts
We are committed to the protection of the environment and train our employees to perform their duties accordingly. In the manufacture of our products throughout the world, we process, store, dispose of and otherwise use large amounts of hazardous materials, especially lead and acid. As a result, we are subject to extensive and evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, we are required to comply with the regulation issued from the European Union called Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals or “REACH”. Under the regulation, companies which manufacture or import more than one ton of a covered chemical substance per year are required to register it in a central database administered by the European Chemicals Agency. The registration process requires the submission of information to demonstrate the safety of chemicals as used and could result in significant costs or delay the manufacture or sale of our products in the European Union. Additionally, industry associations and their member companies, including EnerSys, have scheduled meetings with the European Union member countries to advocate for their support of an exemption for lead compounds. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in ongoing costs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or to obtain or comply with required environmental permits, could result in fines, criminal charges or other sanctions by regulators. From time to time, we have had instances of alleged or actual noncompliance that have resulted in the imposition of fines, penalties and required corrective actions. Our ongoing compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits could require us to incur significant expenses, limit our ability to modify or expand our facilities or continue production and require us to install additional pollution control equipment and make other capital improvements. In addition, private parties, including current or former employees, can bring personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or their exposure to, hazardous substances used, stored, transported or disposed of by us or contained in our products.
Environmental and safety certifications 
Sixteen of our facilities in the Americas, EMEA and Asia are certified to ISO 14001 standards. ISO 14001 is a globally recognized, voluntary program that focuses on the implementation, maintenance and continual improvement of an environmental management system and the improvement of environmental performance. Eight facilities in EMEA and Asia are certified to ISO 45001 standards. The ISO 45001 is a globally recognized occupational health and safety management systems standard.
Climate change impacts
The potential impact of climate change on our operations is uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensity and increased temperature and sea levels. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report), including in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our operating results are significantly influenced by weather, and significant changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in drier weather and more accommodating temperatures over a greater period of time, we may be able to increase our productivity, which could positively impact our revenues and gross margins. Conversely, if climate change results in a greater amount of rainfall, snow, ice or other less accommodating weather conditions, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively impact our revenues and gross margins. Further, while an increase in severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, blizzards and ice storms, can create a greater amount of emergency restoration service work, it often also can result in delays or other negative consequences for our manufacturing operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. Climate change may also affect the conditions in which we operate, and in some cases, expose us to potentially increased liabilities associated with those environmental conditions. Concerns about climate change could also result in potential new regulations, regulatory actions or requirements to fund energy efficiency activities, any of which could result in increased costs associated with our operations. 
We strive to operate our facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. We have implemented company-wide environmental, health and safety policies and practices, which includes monitoring, training and communication of these policies, formulation of relevant policies and standards. 
Quality Systems
We utilize a global strategy for quality management systems, policies and procedures, the basis of which is the ISO 9001:2015 standard, a worldwide recognized quality standard. We believe in the principles of this standard and reinforce the same by requiring mandatory compliance for all manufacturing, sales and service locations globally that are registered to the ISO 9001 standard. We also focus on specific plant certifications such as AS9100 (Aerospace), ISO13485:2016 (Medical Devices), ISO/TS 22163:2017 (Rail), TL9000 (Telecom), IATF16949:2018 (Automotive). We have also acquired our first Lithium-Ion product certification in accordance with ISO 26262 (Product Safety). 
This strategy enables us to provide consistent quality products and services to meet our customers’ needs.
Human Capital Management 
EnerSys is committed to developing a comprehensive, cohesive and positive employee experience. We consider talent acquisition, development, engagement and retention a key driver of our business success. 
Our Board of Directors, through the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, retains oversight of our human capital management process, including demographics, talent development, employee retention, material aspects of employee compensation, as well as diversity and inclusion, recruitment, and compensation efforts. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reports on human capital matters at each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting. The most significant human capital measures, objectives and initiatives include the following:
Equity, Inclusion and Belonging: We strive to create a work environment that emphasizes respect, fairness and dignity and that does not tolerate discrimination or harassment. Individuals are evaluated based on merit, without discrimination, including discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, marital status, gender (including pregnancy), gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, or other characteristics protected by law. We are committed to providing equal opportunities to every member of our workforce. In addition to following all applicable local laws and regulations, for fiscal year 2022, we have also formed an executive steering committee and funded additional staffing to further support these efforts. 
Health, Safety, and Wellness:  Our fundamental responsibility as an employer is to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all of our employees. This undertaking is explained further in our Safety and Health Policy. We equally realize that we must address environmental challenges, which include undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility and encouraging the development of new technologies.
Our health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing the multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of our manufacturing and production facilities, service centers and headquarter operations. Above all else, we are dedicated to the safety and well-being of our employees. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in 2020, we quickly shifted to a remote work environment where possible, and provided employees with the resources necessary to effectively perform their job responsibilities. Additionally, we implemented changes to our manufacturing and distribution operations to include the use of personal protective equipment, intensive cleaning measures, and social distancing.
Philanthropy and Volunteerism: EnerSys is strongly committed to being an outstanding corporate citizen on a global basis in all of the countries and communities where we do business. This commitment is reflected in a strong ethic for charitable contributions, endorsement of community activities, encouraging employees to give freely of their own time to serve on boards or committees in many organizations and supporting educational programs in schools and colleges.
We created several committees to assist the company in its philanthropic endeavors that support all communities in which we work. Additionally, we regularly sponsor volunteer events and fundraising campaigns, to encourage our employees to give back to our communities, a commitment that we further support by offering employees paid time off for charitable volunteering. 
Training and Career Management: Employees receive regular development feedback through quarterly 1:1 reviews with their manager, which encourages open dialogues to identify and cultivate skills and opportunities. We encourage our leaders to facilitate effective conversations and measure the effectiveness of these conversations by regularly surveying our employees. In addition to training and development opportunities, all new employees are required to participate in substantial training seminars to introduce them to the EnerSys business, our strategy, our culture and philosophies. We encourage all of our employees to engage in ongoing training, professional development and educational advancement programs. Through our 
established EnerSys Academy, we provide employees worldwide with resources to expand their knowledge on a broad scope of relevant topics to promote their growth and development. 
Compensation and Benefits: To attract, retain and recognize talent, we aim to ensure merit-based, compensation practices and strive to provide competitive compensation and benefit packages to our workforce. We provide employee wages that are consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. We align our executives' and eligible employees' annual bonus opportunity and long-term equity compensation with our stockholders' interests by linking realizable pay with company financial and stock performance. We completed an initial pay equity study in fiscal year 2021 to further evaluate our global pay practices across the organization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided resources for well-being and work life flexibility for our employees to take care of themselves and their families. 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
We have been integrating the fundamental sustainable values of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) into our everyday operations and future business strategies. Our sustainability team leads our significant efforts with respect to climate change management, product sustainability, operations, supply chain management, workforce health and safety, diversity, equity, inclusion, and community engagement.
We further believe that the power systems and energy management sector has a key role to play in finding innovative solutions to address global climate change. Our climate change policy underscores our goal to carry out all business activities in a sustainable manner. Our environmental policies and practices aim to protect, conserve, and sustain the world’s natural resources, as well as to protect our customers and the communities in which we live and operate. We also offer a complete battery recycling program to assist our customers in preserving our environment and comply with recycling and waste disposal regulations.
Relationships between EnerSys and our suppliers must be based on mutual respect and integrity. Our purchasing and quality teams strive to maintain the highest standards and principles of business ethics, courtesy and competence in dealings and transactions with suppliers. Our code of supplier conduct reflects our commitment to the values of honesty, integrity, respect, and responsibility. We expect our suppliers will share and embrace our values, as well as our commitment to regulatory compliance.
We have formed an ESG steering committee, which includes members of senior management and funded additional staffing to further support the ongoing development of our ESG program. In addition, we clarified that our Board of Directors oversees our programs related to matters of corporate responsibility and sustainability performance, including climate change, through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. These actions demonstrate the strength and commitment to sustainability throughout the organization worldwide.
