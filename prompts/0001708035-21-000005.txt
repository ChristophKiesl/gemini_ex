Our Company
We are an integrated global provider of specialty catalysts, chemicals and services that enable environmental improvements and enhance consumer and industrial products. Our value-added products seek to address global demand trends that are often either the subject of significant environmental and safety regulations or are driven by consumer preferences for environmentally friendlier alternative products, which provides us with high-margin growth opportunities. Specifically, our products and solutions help companies produce vehicles with improved fuel efficiency and cleaner emissions. Our materials are critical ingredients in consumer products that make teeth brighter and skin softer. Because our products are predominantly inorganic and carbon-free, we believe we contribute to improving the sustainability of our planet.
We believe we are a leader in each of our business segments, holding what we estimate to be a number one or number two supply share position for products that generated more than 90% of our 2020 sales. We believe that our global footprint and efficient network of strategically located manufacturing facilities provide us with a strong competitive advantage in serving our customers both regionally as well as globally.
We believe, with our long history of established partnerships with our customers and our reputation for providing reliable, quality of products and solutions, our products deliver significant value to our customers, as demonstrated by our profit margins. Our products typically constitute a small portion of our customers’ overall end-product costs yet are critical to product performance.
We have a near 200-year track record of innovation that is reflected in our technical and production expertise in silicates, silica, zeolites and catalyst technologies.
We are highly diversified by business, geography and end use. In 2020 the majority of our sales were for applications that have historically had relatively predictable, consistent demand patterns driven by consumption or frequent replacement cycles.
As a result of our competitive strengths, we have generally maintained stable margins through changing macro economic cycles.
In 2020, we served over 2,000 customers globally across many end uses and, as of December 31, 2020, operated 40 manufacturing facilities which are strategically located across five continents.

Our Strategy
We intend to capitalize on our strong business foundation, market-based approach, and experienced management team to grow sales profitably, maintain high margins, deploy capital efficiently and generate free cash flow in order to create shareholder value. We believe that our long history of operational excellence and proven reliability, technology leadership, strong customer relationships, innovation track record and consistent business execution developed from our almost two centuries of combined industry experience positions us well to execute our business strategy.
Our Industry
Our industry is characterized by constant development of new products and the need to support customers with new product innovation and technical services to meet their needs, coupled with consistent product quality and a reliable source of supply in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner. Products sold to our customers can be high value-add even when they represent a small portion of the overall end product costs, and success can be achieved by helping customers improve their product performance, value, and quality. As a result, operating margins in this sector have historically been high and generally stable through economic cycles. In addition, many products in the specialty chemicals industry benefit from economics that favor incumbent producers because the capital cost to expand existing capacity is typically significantly less than the capital cost necessary to build a new plant. The combination of attractive operating margins and generally predictable maintenance capital expenditure requirements can produce attractive cash flows.

Competitive Business Strengths
Favorable Secular Growth Trends Across the Portfolio
We focus on serving end use applications where we believe significant future growth potential exists. Our products address our customers’ needs, which are typically driven either by regulatory requirements or consumer preferences, on a global basis. In 2020, a majority of our sales were to end uses such as fuels and emission controls, consumer products and industrial applications that generally do not exhibit as much cyclicality as other applications. We believe that our products incorporate innovative environmental and safety solutions to address evolving customer demands, examples of which include the following:
Increased use of plastics as a substitute for heavier and less versatile materials, such as glass and metal, is driving increased global demand for polyethylene capacity expansions and production. Further, we are seeing expansions shift towards silica-based technology, which we believe will drive growth for our Silica Catalysts product group within our Catalysts segment.
Light- and heavy-duty diesel engines are subject to a broad set of regulatory requirements and are subject to increasingly strict standards. We believe these trends present global opportunities for the Zeolyst Joint Venture to support our customers in meeting these standards through our sales of emission control catalysts. While the US Environmental Protection Agency and European Union have led other nations in terms of standards that limit the amount of nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and other emissions for diesel engines, other emerging regions are implementing similar standards, specifically China, with the China VI (equivalent to Euro VI) emission standard enacted in 2020.
Given stringent fuel efficiency standards that are driving the design of new engines and the resulting higher-octane gasoline requirements that can be achieved through alkylate blending, we believe that our Refining Services segment is well positioned to benefit from any related growth in demand for alkylates.
We also believe we have opportunities to displace other less environmentally friendly materials for industrial and consumer good applications through our business segments. Our Refining Services segment is the largest North American recycler and one of the largest consumers of refinery by-products of sulfur, enabling them to be converted to other applications. In our Catalysts segment, we are helping our customers meet evolving regulatory requirements for the reduction of sulfur from diesel fuel and reduction of NOx emissions from diesel engines through our custom zeolites. Similarly, our specialty zeolites and silica supported catalysts are enabling our customers to improve fuel economy and utilize renewable resources through development of improved lubricants, lightweight polymers and renewable transportation fuel. Our Performance Chemicals products are manufactured from commonly found materials such as industrial sand and soda ash, which are more environmentally friendly than carbon-based products.
Leading Supply Positions
We believe that we maintain a leading supply position for certain products sold within each of our segments, holding what we estimate to be the number one or two supply share position in 2020 for products that generated more than 90% of our sales. We believe that our global footprint and efficient network of strategically located manufacturing facilities provides us with a strong competitive advantage in serving our customers both globally and regionally, and that it would be costly for our competitors to replicate our network.
In our Catalysts segment, we primarily compete on a global basis. We are a leading supplier of refinery hydrocracking catalyst finished and support catalysts used to remove sulfur, and emission control catalysts used in the heavy- and light-duty diesel industries to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions. We are also a global supplier of silica catalysts and supports for polyethylene manufacturers and the exclusive supplier of methyl methacrylate (“MMA”) catalysts used in the patented Alpha process practiced by a global MMA leader.
In our Refining Services segment, we hold an estimated number one supply share position in the United States in sulfuric acid regeneration based on 2020 sales volume of greater than 50%.
In our Performance Chemicals segment, we are a leading supplier in the United States, Europe and Latin America, and largely support customers with regional and local production due to costs of shipping. We estimate that we had at least two times the sodium silicate supply share of our nearest competitor based on 2020 sales volume.
Innovation Track Record
A key competitive advantage is derived from our depth of expertise in silicates, silica, zeolites and catalysts technologies. Further, we have the ability to tailor and scale specialty grades to meet changing demands and technical support for large scale commercialization. Many of our products require close customer collaboration to address constantly evolving customer application challenges. Given the long lead-time required for product development and commercialization, which can be up to ten years, we work closely and build long-term relationships with our customers. In many cases, our relationships have spanned decades given our ability to meet customized specifications and performance characteristics while also maintaining strict quality standards. 
These long-term relationships have allowed us to innovate together with our customers to meet evolving demands. For example, we have developed zeolite-based catalysts that are an effective and efficient method to reduce pollutants from heavy- and light-duty diesel engines and enable our customers to meet increasingly stringent vehicle emission standards worldwide. In personal care applications, we have collaborated with leading consumer products companies over a number of years to develop a family of gentle silica-based dentifrice abrasives that produce more effective cleaning toothpastes. In addition, our proprietary silica catalyst has enabled development of a high strength high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) resin that is used for making lightweight plastic gasoline tanks for automobiles.
Long-Term, High-Quality Customer Relationships
We collaborate with leading multinational companies that often seek global solutions. Our customers include large industrial companies such as ExxonMobile, BASF, and Unilever, and global catalyst producers such as Albemarle and W.R. Grace. We also supply catalysts to leading chemical and petrochemical producers such as BASF, Dow Chemical, Lucite, LyondellBasell, and Shell. We supply personal care ingredients and additives to leading consumer products companies such as Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive. We have long-term relationships with our top ten customers, based on 2020 sales, that average more than 50 years. In addition, our customer base is diversified, with our top ten customers in 2020 representing approximately 30% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 and no customer representing more than 5% of our sales during this period.
Secured Contractual Pass-through of Raw Material Costs Support Stable Margins
We have been able to mitigate the impact of raw material or energy price volatility using a variety of mechanisms, including hedging and raw material cost pass-through clauses in our sales contracts and other adjustment provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 30% of our Performance Chemicals sales (mostly comprised of sodium silicate sales) were derived from contracts that included raw material pass-through clauses. Most of our Refining Services contracts feature minimum volume protection and/or quarterly price adjustments for items such as commodity inputs, labor, the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index and natural gas. In 2020, approximately 80% of our Refining Services segment sales were sold under contracts that included some form of raw material pass-through clause. These price adjustments generally reflect our Refining Services actual cost structure in producing sulfuric acid, and tend to provide us with some protection against volatility in labor, fixed costs and raw material pricing. Freight expenses are generally passed through directly to customers.
Our products are predominantly inorganic and carbon-free, and are produced from readily available raw materials such as industrial sand and soda ash, which prices have historically been less volatile than oil. We also use natural gas in our furnaces where our North American facilities have benefited from the plentiful supplies of shale gas. In addition, we have long-term supply contracts with many of our key raw materials suppliers across all our business segments.
Long Term Customer Contracts Enhance Sales Predictability and Stability
We partner with many of our customers under long-term contract agreements, mutually exclusive product supply arrangements and/or specified products for certain license production processes. In our Refining Services segment, approximately 50% of our production capacity serves customers with staggered five to ten year “take or pay” contracts with potential for value pricing resets and cost pass-through for our regeneration services product line that enhances sales and margin predictability and stability. Excluding contracts with automatic evergreen provisions, approximately 40% of our sulfuric acid volume for the year ended December 31, 2020 was under contracts expiring at the end of 2021 or beyond.
In our Catalysts segment, we are either the sole or dual supplier to key global customers under various term agreements up to 10 years for each of polyolefin catalysts and silica catalysts supports. Further, we are an exclusive multi-year supplier of MMA catalyst to a leading global producer. In our zeolite catalysts product group, we operate with a mix of evergreen and various term contracts depending on the product customization with value pricing ranging from 1 to 3 years to supply catalysts and zeolite powders for the refining, petrochemical and chemical industries and nitrogen oxides control catalysts for diesel transportation industries. These terms, in line with industry standards, provide us with flexibility in satisfying customers. Our Performance Chemicals segment operates under key customer supply contracts with material cost pass-through ranging from 1 to 5 years, largely depending on terms for customer demand given regional and/or product solution needs.
Strategic and Differentiated Manufacturing Know-how and Supply Chain Global Network
Our manufacturing platform is based on furnace technology and proprietary knowledge developed from almost two centuries of combined experience applying silicates chemistry production and the development of applications across a broadening set of end uses. All of our segments produce materials through our furnace process, other than our silica catalysts and zeolite catalysts product groups, which are derivatives of our Performance Chemicals segment. We believe we have a differentiated capability around furnace operations that enables us to operate more efficiently than most of our competitors.
Stable Margins and Cash Flow Generation Across Changing Macroeconomic Cycles
We have demonstrated the ability to maintain stable margins while continuing to grow in different macroeconomic environments given secular trends supporting many of our business segments. We believe that the stability of our margins and cash flows is also aided by long term sales contracts and material cost pass-through. Our ability to enter into favorable contracts and terms with customers is driven by our long history of collaborative relationships and track record of providing value-added products and services. We believe that our value-added products and services have proven to be critical to the performance of our customers’ products, and typically represent only a small portion of our customers’ overall end-product costs.
Our cash flow generation has been driven, in part, by our disciplined capital investment as well as tax attributes that provide us with cash flow benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had $263.7 million of tax deductible intangibles and goodwill with respect to Eco Services Operations LLC of which provides us with cash tax savings as we generate taxable income.
Our Business Segments
We are an integrated, global provider of specialty catalysts, chemicals and services that share common end uses, manufacturing techniques, and process technology. We conduct operations through three reporting segments: (1) Refining Services, (2) Catalysts (including our 50% interest in the Zeolyst Joint Venture) and (3) Performance Chemicals. Effective October 15, 2020, our former Performance Materials segment was treated as a discontinued operation and was subsequently sold on December 14, 2020.

Refining Services
Our Refining Services segment is a leading provider of sulfuric acid recycling (Regeneration Services) and end-to-end logistics to North American refineries for the production of alkylate, a high value gasoline blending component required for meeting gasoline specifications and producing premium grade fuel. We are also a leading North American producer of on-purpose virgin sulfuric acid for water treatment, mining, and industrial applications. By providing regeneration services, as well as purchasing by-product sulfur from customers as a source of energy and for use in manufacturing virgin sulfuric acid, we believe that we provide our refining customers with a complete solution for their sulfuric acid needs.
Trends for increased alkylate production are being driven by: rising demand for premium gasoline used in smaller, more efficient turbocharged engines, which requires higher octane rated gasoline with an alkylate content of approximately 35%-45%, as compared to the 12% alkylate content in regular gasoline; the need for more alkylate to meet the minimum octane ratings in regular gasoline following the continued significant share growth of shale oil refining in the U.S.; the full implementation of Tier 3 gasoline sulfur standards in the United States was enacted for 2020, which requires the blending of additional low sulfur high octane gasoline components such as alkylate; and rising gasoline exports, which generally contain no ethanol and will generally require more alkylate to replace the ethanol in order to meet the minimum octane requirements for the destination countries.
Our Refining Services segment is highly regionalized due to shipping costs and our customer integration requirements. Our network of facilities is concentrated in the Gulf Coast and the state of California, where approximately 68% of the United States refining capacity is located. The strategic locations of our plants in these key refining regions contribute to our highly efficient supply chain networks with our customers, including in some cases captive pipelines connecting us to our refinery customers. Alternatively, product can be shipped by barge, rail and truck.
Our primary product groups include Regeneration Services and Virgin Sulfuric Acid.
Regeneration Services serves a critical need for refining customers. Sulfuric acid serves as a catalyst in the alkylation process. The resulting spent sulfuric acid needs to be regenerated, which is no longer a core competency of most refiners. Since storage space for fresh and spent acid is typically limited, and the cost to refineries of interruption to their alkylation units would be significant, refineries seek to have a continuous and reliable source of supply for sulfuric acid.
Our end-to-end regeneration service offering takes the spent acid from the refinery, through our network of plants and transportation systems, and recycles the acid into a high strength fresh acid for reuse in the alkylation process. Because of the number and strategic locations of our plants, and the breadth of our transportation logistics, we believe we bring the highest reliability and flexibility to our refining customers, allowing them to focus on their core competency by optimizing their alkylation capacity.
Virgin sulfuric acid is created either through the burning of sulfur in furnaces, or as a by-product of other industrial processes, primarily the smelting of copper and other base metals. We produce a range of high quality virgin sulfuric acid products by burning sulfur in our plants for supply into a diverse set of end uses. Sulfur-burned acid is generally considered to be of higher purity and quality than smelter-produced acid and, as a result, smelter-produced acid is not suitable for some industrial users including several of our larger customers who require higher quality and differentiated sulfuric acid products, such as super-saturated sulfuric acid (oleum) and other high purity specialty acids. Virgin sulfuric acid is produced at all of our facilities utilizing the same production equipment as our regeneration services.
Competition
Given our strategic presence on the Gulf Coast and in California, and our relationships with leading refineries, we estimate that our regenerated sulfuric acid supply share is substantially larger than our closest competitor. We compete in the North American refining services industry with competitors such as Chemtrade and Veolia. We compete on the basis of price, reliability, and responsiveness to changes in customer demand, which is a function of scale, proximity to customer locations and operational expertise. We believe that we benefit from industry economics that favor incumbent producers because the capital cost and regulatory challenges to expand existing capacity are typically significantly less than to build a new plant. In addition, existing robust supply chains, including captive pipeline connections and other transportation logistics add to the competitive advantages available to incumbent producers. As a result, we believe that our integrated and strategically located network of facilities and end-to-end logistics assets in the United States provide us with a significant competitive advantage and would be costly for our competitors to replicate.
Manufacturing
We produce regenerated sulfuric acid and virgin sulfuric acid through our furnace operations. Regenerated sulfuric acid is produced by thermally decomposing the spent acid in our furnace into a clean gas stream which is converted into sulfuric acid. Virgin sulfuric acid is produced by burning sulfur and certain sulfur-rich components at high temperatures within a furnace. The chart below summarizes the manufacturing platform for our Refining Services segment.
Refining Services Manufacturing Platform
Catalysts
We are a leading global provider of customized and innovative catalyst products and process solutions to leading producers and licensors of polyethylene, or PE, and methyl methacrylate, or MMA. Our finished silica-based catalysts and catalyst supports are necessary to produce high strength and high stiffness plastics used in packaging films, bottles, containers, and other molded applications. Global consumer demand for high strength lightweight plastics is expected to continue in the near to medium term driving increased production capacity expansions. Our zeolite-based emission control catalysts enable the removal of nitrogen oxides from diesel engine emissions as well as sulfur dioxide from fuels during the refining process. The continued expansion of stricter global regulations for reducing sulfur in all fuel pools is expected to drive the ongoing demand for our products.
Our product groups include Silica Catalysts and Zeolite Catalysts. Zeolite Catalyst products are sold through the Zeolyst Joint Venture.
Silica Catalysts supplies both the finished catalyst and catalyst supports, which are critical catalyst components for the production of HDPE, a high strength and high stiffness plastic used in bottles, containers, and molded applications and LLDPE used predominately for films. We also produce a catalyst that is used globally for the production of MMA, the monomer for acrylic engineering resins, a clear scratch-resistant plastic used in sheet or molded form to replace glass and as a durable surface coating. Because these catalysts are highly technical and customized for our customers to produce resins with specific properties, they are often covered under long-term supply agreements and, in some cases, we are a customer’s sole source supplier. In addition, we produce silica anti-blocking products that are used to prevent opposite faces of polyolefin and polyester films from adhering to one another during manufacturing and in use.
The Zeolyst Joint Venture, (formed in 1988 specifically as Zeolyst International and Zeolyst C.V., our 50% owned joint venture with Shell Catalysts & Technologies, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc. or “Shell”), supplies critical high technology specialty zeolite and zeolite-based catalysts to customers in three end uses: refining (primarily hydrocracking catalyst and dewaxing), petrochemicals, and emission control systems for both on-road and non-road diesel engines. We also supply custom zeolites to catalyst companies who compete in similar industries. The Zeolyst Joint Venture leverages each partner’s technology and production expertise, including Shell’s expertise in hydrocracking catalyst to maximize liquid product yields, especially distillate while at the same time removing sulfur, and PQ’s expertise in zeolite technology. We also believe the Zeolyst Joint Venture is a first mover in zeolite fuels and emissions control technology and we expect continued expansion as environmental emissions standards increase globally.
To meet sulfur emission control standards, hydrocracking catalyst is the most economic method for refiners while maintaining yields for one of the most profitable product streams. The Zeolyst Joint Venture is the sole supplier of hydrocracking catalyst to Shell, but a majority of sales are to third-party refineries. We also provide precursor supports to many of the hydrocracking catalyst suppliers, positioning us as a leading supplier in the global hydrocracking catalyst supply chain.
To meet nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission control regulations that are expanding globally, many of our zeolite powders are used in an advanced emission control technology called selective catalytic reduction, largely focused on heavy duty diesel (HDD) transportation. This process uses ammonia to react with engine exhaust gases via our catalysts in order to convert NOx, a pollutant, into nitrogen and water. We believe that our zeolite catalysts can enable selective catalytic reduction technology to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides in such exhaust gases by more than 90% and is one of the most cost-effective methods to reduce diesel engine emissions.
Competition
Our Silicia Catalysts product group primarily competes with W.R. Grace. The Zeolyst Joint Venture competes with global catalyst producers such as W.R Grace, BASF, UOP, Axens, and Haldor Topsoe, while at the same time providing many of them customized zeolite solutions for their product offerings. Some direct competition with niche companies exists, including competitors such as Tosoh and Clariant. We typically compete on the basis of performance, product consistency, reliability, and responsiveness to changes in customer demand.
Manufacturing
We manufacture our catalyst products using sodium silicate liquids purchased directly from our Performance Chemicals segment or silica sol liquids made by others from Performance Chemicals sodium silicate to make specialty zeolite and silica products. These zeolites and silicas are either used directly to produce catalysts or are sold as precursors to other catalyst manufacturers.
    The chart below summarizes the manufacturing platform for our Catalysts segment.
Silica Catalysts Manufacturing Platform
Zeolyst Joint Venture Manufacturing Platform
Performance Chemicals
Our Performance Chemicals segment is a leading global producer of sodium silicates, and downstream specialty silicas as well as other silicate derivative products. These products are used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as matting agents in surface coatings, clarifying agents for edible oils and beverages, precursors for green tires, additives for dental cleaning and personal care products, and as feedstock for our additives and catalyst platforms. Given our products are derived from quartz sand, which makes them natural and inert materials, we believe they have the environmental and safety profile to address evolving customer demands to replace certain other chemicals. Silicates and silicate derivatives are recognized on the Safer Chemicals Ingredients List of the EPA’s Safer Choice program, which we believe positively impacts our ability to compete in consumer product applications.
Given the breadth of our global infrastructure in terms of scale operations, geographic diversity and production know-how, we are a leading global supplier to key multi-national industrial and consumer product companies. While we are global, our network is highly regionalized in silicate products and strategically located to support customers in a cost effective manner because of the expense of shipping sodium silicates extended distances due to their water content. We believe that we are the only global silicates producer who can supply all of the major regions, excluding China, and we estimate that we hold at least two times the sodium silicates supply share as our nearest competitor based on 2020 sales volume.
Our product groups include Sodium Silicates, Specialty Silicas and Other Silicate Derivatives.
Sodium Silicates have functional attributes that are used as additives and ingredients to enhance product performance as binders, detergent-builders, pH buffers, adhesives or as chemical feedstock and are in extensive diverse customer applications for construction, cleaning, water treatment, pulp & paper, foundry & refractory, green tires, electronics and refining catalysts.
Specialty Silicas are used as ingredients in consumer products such as personal care products, food, edible oils and beer where customers are seeking more environmentally friendly products without loss of effectiveness or performance. In industrial, uses include gloss control and corrosion control in coil, wood, general industrial leather, and other high-performance surface coating applications. 
Other Silicate Derivatives include metasilicates, spray dried silicates, and magnesium silicates and potassium silicates which supply diverse uses in cleaning, specialty fertilizer, oil & gas, mining, paints, food, and cosmetics. We also produce zeolites, by reaction with aluminum trihydrate, which are used as builders in detergents and in other applications as stabilizers in the production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) applications.
Competition
 In our Performance Chemicals segment, we primarily compete with other global producers such as OxyChem, Grace and Evonik. We believe that we have a leading industry position and technical expertise that provides us with a competitive advantage over competitors who manufacture only in particular end uses. Further, we believe that it would be costly and difficult for a new entrant or existing competitor to replicate our breadth or economies of scale in the production of sodium silicate.
We believe that our network of strategically located manufacturing facilities, with operations in North America, Europe, South America and Africa, allows us to serve our customers at a lower cost than our competitors and with quicker delivery times for our products. In the industry, we compete primarily on the basis of performance, product consistency, quality, reliability, and ability to innovate in response to customer demands.
Manufacturing
Performance Chemicals’ products are produced through an integrated supply chain beginning with regional and large scale upstream production of sodium silicates and downstream derivatives. Sodium silicates are produced regionally because of the expense of shipping sodium silicates extended distances due to their water content. Our sodium silicates are produced by fusing readily available industrial sand and soda ash in our proprietary furnace operations. We dissolve the molten silicate from the furnace into water and sell these products in liquid form. Downstream derivatives are produced through a variety of chemical operations that create aqueous, solid, and gel forms for our products.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 50% of our North American silicate sales, which represented a significant portion of our Performance Chemicals segment sales, were derived from contracts that included raw material cost pass-through clauses. Under these contracts, there is usually a time lag of between three and nine months for cost changes to pass-through, depending on the magnitude of the change, industry dynamics and the terms of the particular contract.
The chart below summarizes the manufacturing platform for our Performance Chemicals segment.

Raw Materials
We estimate that our raw material costs represent approximately 40% of total cost of goods sold in the year ended December 31, 2020. Our products are predominantly inorganic and carbon-free, and are produced from readily available raw materials such as industrial sand and soda ash, which prices have historically been less volatile than oil. We also use natural gas in our furnaces, with our North American facilities benefiting from the plentiful supplies of shale gas. In addition, we have long-term supply contracts with many of our key raw materials suppliers across our segments. We have also been able to mitigate the impact of raw material or energy price volatility using a variety of mechanisms, including hedging and raw material cost pass-through clauses in our sales contracts and other adjustment provisions.
We are able to negotiate our supply agreements for our key raw materials based on our leading industry position and global scale in an effort to achieve competitive pricing. We also maintain a raw material quality audit and qualification program designed to ensure that the material we purchase satisfies stringent quality requirements. Key raw materials for our segments include:

Key Raw Materials | Segments 
Soda Ash | Refining Services, Performance Chemicals
Sodium hydroxide ("caustic soda") | Refining Services, Performance Chemicals
Sulfur | Refining Services 
Industrial sand | Performance Chemicals 
Aluminum trihydrate | Refining Services, Performance Chemicals

While natural gas is not a direct feedstock for any individual product, we use natural gas powered furnaces to heat raw materials and create the chemical reactions necessary to manufacture our products. We maintain multiple suppliers wherever possible and we seek to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in prices for natural gas, forward purchases of natural gas in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and the use of pass-through clauses for raw material and natural gas costs in our customer contracts. However, we may not be successful in passing through all increases in raw material costs or maintaining an uninterrupted supply of natural gas for all of our furnaces. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business - If we are unable to pass on increases in raw material prices, including natural gas, to our customers or to retain or replace our key suppliers, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected”.
Joint Ventures
We have entered into several long-standing joint ventures to supplement our businesses and access other geographic locations, minimize costs and accelerate growth in areas we believe have significant business potential, with the most significant of these joint ventures including the following:
Zeolyst Joint Venture. The Zeolyst Joint Venture is a long-standing partnership with Shell Catalysts & Technologies, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc. or “Shell”, that dates back to 1988 and is focused on the development, manufacture and sale of zeolite-containing catalysts through manufacturing facilities located in Kansas and the Netherlands. We combine our expertise in zeolite supply and technology with our partner’s expertise in global refinery catalyst sales and technology. We have a 50% ownership stake in the Zeolyst Joint Venture. We supply sodium silicate from our Performance Chemicals segment to the Zeolyst Joint Venture to make specialty zeolites, which are used as precursors in emission control and custom catalysts. We also produce specialty zeolites that are precursors for the production of hydrocracking catalyst and other refinery and petrochemical catalysts that are used by our other segments and sold to third parties. We manage the production of these specialty zeolites due to our expertise in zeolite production. These catalysts include aromatic catalysts that upgrade aromatic by-product streams, dewaxing catalysts that improve lube oil performance and diesel cold flow performance, and paraffin isomerization catalysts that upgrade olefins to high octane gasoline blending components for refinery and petrochemical customers.
PQ Holdings Mexicana S.A. de C.V. PQ Holdings Mexicana was established in 2000 as a joint venture with Solvay Alkalis, Inc. for the manufacture, marketing and sale of various chemicals, including sodium silicate, through manufacturing facilities in Tlalnepantla and Guadalajara, Mexico. We have an 80% ownership stake in PQ Holdings Mexicana.
Research and Development
We benefit from the highly-skilled technical capabilities of our employees dedicated to new product development. We operate four research and development facilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Our research and development activities are directed toward the development of new and improved products, processes, systems and applications for customers. Our research and development team is organized to support each of our operating businesses and staffed with experienced scientists, technical service representatives and process engineers with direct knowledge of our products. This business group and customer-oriented team structure provides strong links between our product development and manufacturing functions and our customer collaboration and specifications. These connections enable us to focus our development on timely and relevant products for our customers while remaining attentive to manufacturing considerations to enable us to produce new products profitably and in a timely manner. Product development activities are organized into research and development projects that are subject to regular reviews by the business teams in order to understand and address our customers’ evolving needs and invest in our growth by prioritizing innovation driven by these identified needs. In addition, we hold senior-level project reviews to ensure best practices are shared and consistent metrics are used to determine a project’s merit and the size of the potential opportunity.
Intellectual Property
We evaluate on a case-by-case basis how best to use patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other available intellectual property protections in order to protect our products and our critical investments in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. We focus on securing and maintaining patents for certain inventions such as composition-of-matter, while maintaining other inventions such as process improvements as trade secrets, derived from our market-based business model, in an effort to maximize the value of our product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities and reinforce our competitive advantage. Our policy is to seek appropriate intellectual property protection for significant product and process developments in the major areas where the relevant products are manufactured or sold. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product uses. Patents extend for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries in which the patents are registered. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of subject matter covered by the patent and the scope of the claims of the patent.
In most industrial countries, patent protection may be available for new substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production processes. However, given the geographical scope of our business and our continued growth strategy, there are regions of the world in which we do business or may do business in the future where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. Moreover, we monitor our competitors’ products and, if circumstances were to dictate that we do so, we would vigorously challenge the actions of others that conflict with our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We maintain appropriate information security policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the safeguarding of confidential information including, where appropriate, data encryption, access controls and employee awareness training.
We own or have rights to a number of patents relating to our products and processes. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 39 patented inventions in the United States, with approximately 286 patents issued in countries around the world and approximately 69 patent applications pending worldwide covering more than 11 additional inventions. As of December 31, 2020, we also had trademark rights in approximately 379 trademark registrations worldwide, including approximately 44 U.S. trademark registrations. We also have approximately 21 pending trademark applications, which include applications in the United States and worldwide. In addition to our registered and applied-for intellectual property portfolio, we also claim ownership of certain trade secrets and proprietary know-how developed by and used in our business. Including our joint ventures, we are party to certain arrangements whereby we license in the right to use certain intellectual property rights in connection with our business.
Seasonality
Our Refining Services segment typically experiences seasonal fluctuations as a result of higher demand for gasoline products in the summer and lower demand in the winter months. These demand fluctuations results in higher sales and working capital requirements in the second and third quarter.
Environmental Stewardship
Sustainability is intertwined with our daily business and is reinforced through our strategy and values. Our diverse product technologies enable downstream sustainability. Our Performance Chemicals segment provides products that are designed to support bio-fuel purification, specialty silicas for low-VOC environmentally preferred coatings, and our sodium silicates are designed to extend the durability of municipal water treatment pipelines by inhibiting corrosion. Our Refining Services segment regenerates sulfuric acid for the refining industry avoiding significant landfill or deep well disposal annually. Certain of our Catalyst segment’s products are designed to reduce pollutants, such as nitrous oxides (NOx) in vehicle exhaust and by removing sulfur from fuels. 
Our global product technology team formalized its ideation process in 2019 and continues to drive transformational growth through innovation. The team considers product sustainability across the life-cycle in its stage-gate process.
As an American Chemistry Council (“ACC”) Responsible Care® member company, we continue to report our health, safety, and environmental metrics annually. Our sustainability metrics, including waste generation and water consumption for 2018 and 2019, have been third party assured in 2020. On the sustainability pages of our website, we provided our inaugural sustainability report, including our sustainability goals, materiality matrix, letters of assurance, and the corresponding Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Disclosure and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index. Building on our commitment of improvement across sustainability elements, we selected and began implementation of our corporate-wide sustainability software platform in late 2020. Upon full implementation of our software in 2021, we plan to introduce our internal real-time sustainability performance dashboard to enable improved analytics and greater visibility into our sustainability impacts.
Social Responsibility, including human capital discussions
We are focused on the safety of our employees. We continued our flagship health, safety and environmental program - PQ Perfect Days (“Perfect Days”). The Perfect Days program targets at-risk behaviors and celebrates positive health, safety and environmental performance across the organization on a daily basis. As part of that program, we have set annual Perfect Day and Total Recordable Incident Rate goals and targets that link to performance and drive accountability. We concluded 2020 with no material environmental and safety incidents or accidents and achieved our 2020 target of ACC top quartile total case incident rate performance based upon 2019 benchmark data. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced another level of health and safety performance concerns in 2020 as the entire globe entered the COVID-19 pandemic. We quickly introduced, and have maintained protocols to minimize risk of exposure and transmittal within all of our work sites so that we could continue to provide for all of our customers while keeping our employees safe and healthy. 
Our executive leadership across the organization, led by our Chairman and CEO, formed our COVID Rapid Response Team (CRRT). The team has worked to maintain our health and safety standards while effectively managing COVID-19 impacts to the business and our sites. The team’s responsibilities include tracking and implementing government requirements and CDC guidelines to enable appropriate actions be taken; leading communications to our employees, customers, and entire supply chain; and sharing best practices and lessons learned from our response. Business leadership executed established business continuity plans, which included our market response with the primary goal of safeguarding the health and safety of our people and supporting the needs of our customers, while also maximizing productivity for the Company.
Further in 2020, the leadership and rapid response teams prepared guidance for all sites and functions, which included preventative measures and return-to-work procedures. Operations shifts were adjusted, up to and including temporary shutdowns as necessary, to minimize exposures and to protect all personnel. Most of the practices remain in place today and are now part of our preparation standards.
Our flagship “Success through people” program furthers our strategy by acknowledging our workforce is key to our success. We offer highly competitive salaries, benefits, developmental opportunities and work/life balance. We proactively seek to attract, incentivize and retain a talented and motivated workforce. Our global succession planning process is designed to provide sufficient talented personnel to fill key leadership, innovation and manufacturing roles well into the future and to better prepare employees for their future at the Company. In order to enable a pipeline for our leadership, we maintain a robust Emerging Leaders program to identify top talent to build leadership capabilities and provide the fundamental skills we believe every leader needs to generate passion and productivity in their team. The program also provides an important networking opportunity that creates a connected community of leaders at the Company. 
We review our compensation and benefits programs periodically to ensure continued competitiveness. In the US, our benefit program is designed to help protect the health and financial well-being of our full-time employees and their family members today, offering a choice of several medical & dental plans, as well as vision, flexible spending accounts, short-term and long-term disability insurance and an employee assistance program. To help them prepare for their future, we offer a defined contribution savings plan, which includes company contributions. Benefits outside the US are designed to supplement government-provided programs in each country.
We actively promote diversity within the Company and seek to have a workforce that reflects the diversity of the societies in which we operate. We strive to hire candidates from diverse backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities. 
Building on a global footprint that spans across 16 countries, we benefit from our talented and dedicated employees that make up a diverse population, where more than half of our workforce of 2,274 employees are located outside the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we had 2,274 employees worldwide, of which 1,019 were employed in the United States, 343 were employed in Canada, Mexico, and Brazil, 735 were employed throughout Europe, 37 were employed in South Africa and 95 were employed in Indonesia. Our remaining employees are dispersed throughout Asia, primarily in Thailand. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 49% of our employees were represented by a union, works council or other employee representative body. We believe we have good relationships with our employees and their respective works councils, unions or other bargaining representatives. Further, at December 31, 2020, approximately 25% of our U.S.-based executives, managers and professionals were women.
This international strength, supported by our core values of integrity and fairness, fosters a rich culture founded on diverse of thought. We firmly believe that success is achieved through the intellect and commitment of our people, so we employ a long-term human capital program to attract, retain and develop talent for the future. We are proud of our highly collaborative teams that enable an inclusive workplace where employees are encouraged to bring their own experiences to promote innovation from all levels of the organization. This constructive work environment has been re-enforced with the recent implementation of a fully integrated on-line performance management process that improves the communication of aligned goals, encourages consistent feedback and furthers employee engagement. Today, there are women on the management teams of each of our businesses as well as in all our functions: R&D, Finance, HSE and Human Resources.
While the COVID-19 pandemic limited the opportunities for in-person engagement in our communities, our sites continued to support food security programs and people in need across our global network. For example, our Hammond site supported efforts to stock food pantries through their participation with the local United Way and Heels for Meals programs. The Malvern office continued its support for local families with donations to the Pennridge FISH Organization.
Governance
Our governance programs and policies can be found in the Company’s Ethics section of the sustainability webpages, which is routinely updated and includes our policies on child labor, human trafficking, anti-harassment, antibribery, and cyber security all of which are evaluated by third-parties, including Ecovadis. Our 2020 Ecovadis Assessment scored PQ’s Ethics response in the top quartile of our sector category, basic chemicals. We continue to provide annual Code of Conduct training to all our global employees and have enhanced our delivery with online learning modules.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental laws and regulations, which address, among other things, the following:
•emissions to the air;
•discharges to soils and surface and subsurface waters;
•other releases into the environment;
•prevention and remediation of releases into the indoor or outdoor environment;
•generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials;
•maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace;
•registration and evaluation of chemicals;
•production, handling, labeling or use of chemicals used or produced by us; and
•stewardship of products after manufacture.
We apply the principles of the Environmental Management standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14001) at our facilities throughout the world. For chemical facilities in the United States, we also adhere to the Responsible Care RC14001 Technical Specifications of the American Chemistry Council.
We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control health, safety, and environmental risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable state, national, and international health, safety, and environmental requirements. We have a strong health, safety, environmental organization. We have a staff of professionals who are responsible for environmental, safety, health and product regulatory compliance. We have implemented a corporate audit program for all of our facilities. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will be in full compliance at all times with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and our industry in general. Evolving chemical regulation programs throughout the world could impose testing requirements or restrictions on our chemical raw materials and products.
Environmental Remediation. Environmental laws and regulations require mitigation or remediation of the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances. Under some of these regulations, as the current or former owner or operator of a property, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on or under the property, without regard to whether we knew of or caused the contamination, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were permitted at the time they occurred. Many of our current or former production sites have an extended history of industrial use, and it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future. Soil and groundwater contamination requiring investigation and remediation has been discovered at some of the sites, and might occur or be discovered at other sites. Several active and former facilities currently are undergoing investigation and remediation, including sites in Dominguez, CA; Martinez, CA; Rahway, NJ; and Tacoma, WA.
Environmental Programs. We have comprehensive health, safety and environmental compliance, auditing and management programs in place to assist in our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and with internal policies and procedures, as appropriate. Each facility has developed and implemented specific critical occupational health, safety, environmental, security and loss control programs.
We also have implemented a Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) organizational structure with executive committee level leadership and dedicated environmental experts. We have Regional HSE Specialists and Managers who are embedded in the field and provide HSE expertise and support to operating sites. Certain, larger sites may have dedicated environmental or safety personnel.
Product Safety and Product Stewardship
We have established a Product Safety and Product Stewardship management system that is compliant with the RC14001 technical specification and is supported by two highly skilled Product Stewardship Managers, one of which is a REACH Specialist. We conduct Product Stewardship reviews as part of new product development and routinely evaluate product safety risk for raw materials, intermediates, and products. 
As a chemical company, we are subject to extensive and evolving regulations regarding the manufacturing, processing, distribution, importing, exporting, and labeling of our products and their raw materials. In the European Union, the REACH regulations came into effect in 2007, with implementation rolling out over time. Registered chemicals then can be subject to further evaluation and potential restrictions. Our high-volume chemicals have been registered under REACH; lower-volume chemicals (mainly catalysts) were registered by the applicable 2018 deadline. To date, no further testing has been required. 
Since the promulgation of REACH, other countries have enacted or are in the process of implementing similar comprehensive chemical regulations. These programs include the Korea REACH law, which is requiring registration and
potential testing of chemicals, and similar programs under development in the UK, Taiwan, Turkey, India, and elsewhere. In the US, all pertinent chemicals have been designated as “active” under the US EPA Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. At this time, none have been designated as chemicals which the EPA will prioritize and evaluate for regulation. Based on our chemicals and the various regulations promulgated to date, we do not anticipate costly testing requirements nor severe restrictions, but cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to requirements for our products or raw materials that could materially affect our operations. In particular, some of our products might be characterized as nanomaterials and then be subject to evolving, new nanomaterial regulations.
We remain alert for any regulatory changes which may impact our products and their end uses. In the EU, we are actively working with other industry partners to challenge the recent draft proposal concerning potential listing of silica on Annex II of the regulation on cosmetic products (substances prohibited in cosmetic products).
