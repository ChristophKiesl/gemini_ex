 In-Line and Near-Line
 AutoGauge®: Our automated metrology systems are used in assembly and fabrication plants to contain, correct, and improve the quality of complex assemblies. AutoGauge® systems are placed directly in the manufacturing line or near the line to automatically measure critical dimensional characteristics.  
 AutoGauge®ACF: Our turnkey near-line robotic measurement systems are used in assembly and manufacturing facilities to replace traditional checking fixtures. Virtually everything about AutoGauge®ACF is automatic – from high speed data collection, to real-time reporting and analysis. AutoGauge®ACF measures parts within minutes, greatly increasing inspection throughput compared to CMMs, ring gauges, manual tools, and other optical metrology systems.
 AutoFit®: Our gap and flush systems are used in automotive manufacturing plants to contain, correct, and control the fit of exterior body components. Customers receive critical fit and finish data on the four corners of the fully assembled vehicle, such as tail lamp fit to the quarter panel and decklid; head lamp fit to the hood, fender, and bumper assemblies. They can be installed at multiple locations in the manufacturing process, including in the body shop just after the door load process and in the final assembly area after the vehicle has been painted and completely assembled.  AutoFit® can measure vehicles while in motion along the assembly line or in a stationary position.  
 AutoGuide®:  Our robot guidance systems are used by manufacturing companies to automate assembly operations – improving productivity and quality at the same time.  These systems utilize Perceptron sensors and software to guide and control robots for numerous assembly applications, including automotive windshield insertion, roof loading, hinge mounting, door attachment, and sealant dispensing.  We recently expanded our robot platform for the requirements of de-racking, seam sealing, and glue bead applications. These applications require a simple, robust configuration with minimum setup to eliminate the customers’ need for precision fixtures, large conveyors, station operators and part handlers. 
 AccuSite®:  Our optical tracking technology actively tracks robots on the plant floor providing metrology grade accuracy for both automated metrology and robot guidance solutions.  Absolute accurate systems do not require expensive, time consuming CMM comparison activities and provide the customer with actionable data sooner.  In robot guidance systems, AccuSite® monitors the robots positional drift in high precision assembly operations.  
 Helix®evo:  Our Helix®evo 3D scanning sensors measure the multitude of materials used in today’s manufacturing, such as chrome, aluminum, sheet metal and painted surfaces. Its scan acquisition provides accurate feature extraction along with the pristine scan quality required for form analysis. Helix®evo also uses a single power-over-ethernet cable which reduces the number of auxiliary components required and is designed for fast and accurate measurement on the plant floor. 
 Helix®solo:  Our Helix®solo family of contour and surface sensors are a cost-effective option for single feature measurements. Helix®solo utilizes a high-resolution camera and multiple laser color options offering unparalleled return images on challenging materials without applying sprays, stickers, or additional part preparation.

We supply sensors and software to a number of wheel alignment equipment manufacturers in Europe, Asia and North America who in turn sell alignment systems to automotive manufacturers.
Value Added Services
 Value Added Services: Value Added Services sales in our fiscal year 2020 and 2019 represented 5%, and 5% of our Net Sales, respectively.  Value Added Services include training, field service, calibration, launch support services, consulting services, maintenance agreements and repairs.
Sales and Marketing
 We market our in-line and near-line products directly to end-user Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) customers and through manufacturing line builders and system integrators. We market our Coord3 CMM product line through both direct sales and value added resellers.
 Our principal customers for Measurement Solution products have historically been automotive manufacturing companies that we either sell to directly or through manufacturing line builders, system integrators or assembly equipment manufacturers.  These products are typically purchased for installation in connection with retooling programs undertaken by these companies.  Because sales are dependent on the timing of customers’ retooling programs, sales by customer vary significantly from year to year.  During our fiscal years 2020 and 2019, direct sales to Kuka accounted for approximately 12% and 7%, respectively, and direct sales to Volkswagen Group accounted for approximately 11% and 13%, respectively, and direct sales to General Motors Company accounted for approximately 4% and 11%, respectively, of our Net Sales.  
 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly and calibration of hardware components and the development, testing and integration of our software with these hardware components.  We build our products from a combination of commercially available parts and uniquely designed and manufactured parts.  The components are primarily manufactured by third parties.  Individual components such as printed circuit boards are manufactured and supplied by third parties.  We believe a low level of vertical integration gives us significant manufacturing and inventory flexibility and minimizes total product costs.  
 We purchase certain component parts and assemblies from single and multi-source suppliers.  With respect to the majority of our components, we believe that alternative suppliers could be found if existing suppliers could not ship to us.  Many of our components are customized for our specific manufacturing needs.  Due to these specifications, various lead times would be required, based on the specific component that needed to be re-sourced.  Component supply shortages in certain industries, including the electronics industry, have occurred in the past and are possible in the future due to imbalances in supply and demand.  We use global purchasing sources to minimize the risk of part shortages.  We have not experienced significant component supply shortages from single source suppliers in recent years. Significant delays or interruptions in the delivery of components, assemblies or products by suppliers, or difficulties or delays in shifting manufacturing capacity to new suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on us.  
 Competition
 We believe our products provide cost-efficient and complete solutions for our customers in terms of system capabilities, level of support and competitive pricing for the value provided, which we believe are the principal competitive factors in our markets. We also believe the technology within our products is more advanced than our competition.
 There are a number of companies that sell similar and/or alternative technologies and methods into the same markets and regions as Perceptron. We believe there may be entities, some of which may be larger and have greater resources than our resources, that could develop technology and products which could prove to be competitive with us.   We also believe that certain existing or potential customers may be capable of internally developing their own technology.  See Item 1A: “Risk Factors” titled “There are a number of companies offering competitive products in our markets, or developing products to compete with our products, which could result in a reduction in our revenues through lost sales or a reduction in prices”.
 
Backlog
 Backlog represents orders or bookings we have received but have not yet been filled, that is, our unsatisfied performance obligations.  As of June 30, 2020, we had a backlog of $36.3 million, compared to $38.4 million at June 30, 2019.  Most of our backlog is subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, often with limited or no penalties.  Historically, cancellations of orders once they have been booked have been very infrequent although several cancellations have occurred during the last two fiscal years.  The level of our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of our future operating performance.  We expect to be able to fill substantially all of the orders
