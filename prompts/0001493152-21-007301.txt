Item 1. Business
Background
 
urban-gro, Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively “urban-gro”, “we”, “us” or “the Company”) was originally formed on March 20, 2014, as a Colorado limited liability company. In March 2017, we converted to a Colorado corporation and exchanged shares of our common stock for every member interest issued and outstanding on the date of conversion. On October 29, 2020, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. On December 31, 2020, we effected a 1-for-6 reverse stock split with respect to our common stock. All information in this Report gives effect to this reverse stock split, including restating prior period reported amounts.
Overview
 
urban-gro is a leading engineering and design services company focused on the sustainable commercial indoor horticulture market. We engineer and design indoor controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”) facilities and then integrate complex environmental equipment systems into those facilities. CEA is a market segment that is defined by type of facility, and has no correlation to the industry, or more specifically the crop being grown in the facility. The CEA segment is represented by any horticultural facility that is fully self-contained, and has a fully-controlled environment. There are three facility types that meet these qualifications:

i. | Indoor Facilities - new building; or the retrofit of an existing building; 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | Vertical Farms – a building with a smaller footprint that is built up vertically and we view this category as including modular container farms; and 
iii. | Greenhouses – traditional and made out of a variety of translucent materials as to provide natural sunlight for the crop being grown. 

 
While historically we have been focused on engineering, design, and equipment integration into indoor facilities, of which some are ultimately used for the cultivation of plant-based medicines, we are planning to expand our reach within CEA across both facility type and crop type. The term “plant-based medicines” includes (i) a wide array of herbal supplements including but not limited to curcumin, saffron extract and ginger, (ii) cannabidiol (“CBD”) based therapeutics, (iii) cannabis based therapeutics and (iv) a host of medicines derived from plants such as caffeine, menthol, foxglove and others. We are focusing on expanding to the vertical farming CEA sub-segment, which is ultimately and predominantly used for the cultivation of a variety of crops including, but not limited to, leafy greens, herbs, cucumbers, peppers, and strawberries. As the global horticulture market has become more focused on the safety of the food supply chain, reducing emissions with current transportation methods associated with these crops, and, growing local, we are confident that the vertical farming CEA sub-segment will represent a significant and increasing share of our revenue and be a significant factor in our organic growth moving forward.

Through this work, we create high-performance indoor cultivation facilities for our clients to grow specialty crops, including leafy greens, vegetables, herbs, and cannabis. Historically, a large number of our clients were cannabis producers, and we still do substantial work for those clients, but we have shifted our priorities to non-cannabis crops as we seek to address a broader market. Our custom-tailored approach to design, procurement, and equipment integration provides a single point of accountability across all aspects of indoor growing operations. We also help our clients achieve operational efficiency and economic advantages through a full spectrum of professional services and programs focused on facility optimization and environmental health which establish facilities that allow clients to manage, operate and perform at the highest level throughout their entire cultivation lifecycle once they are up and running.
 
Since commencing business in March 2014, we have introduced new equipment solutions, products and services to the CEA market, expanded our ongoing operations across North America, and most recently, we have entered into several engagements in Europe, and we plan on opening a European Headquarters office.
 
The majority of our clients are commercial CEA cultivators. We believe one of the key points of our differentiation that clients value is the depth of experience of our employees and our Company. We currently employ 47 individuals. Approximately two-thirds of our employees are considered experts in their areas of focus, and our team includes Engineers (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Controls, and Agricultural), Professional Engineers, and individuals with Masters Degrees in Plant Science, Horticulture, and Business Administration. As a company, we have worked on more than 300 indoor CEA facilities, and believe that the experience of our team and Company provide clients with the confidence that we will proactively keep them from making common costly mistakes during the build out that impact operational stages. Our expertise translates into clients saving time, money, and resources through expertise that they can leverage without having to add headcount to their own operations. We provide this experience in addition to offering a platform of the highest quality equipment systems that can be integrated holistically into our clients’ facilities.
 
Our Services and Integrated Equipment Solutions
 
We aim to work with our clients from inception of their project in a way that provides value throughout for the life of their facility. We are a trusted partner and advisor to our clients and offer a complete set of engineering and managed services complemented by a vetted suite of select cultivation equipment systems. Outlined below is an example of a complete project with estimated time frames for each phase that demonstrate how we provide value to our clients.

Service Solutions
 
Engineering and Design Services
 
As a leader in indoor CEA facilities, we provide our clients with service offerings that span from engineering design to the operational stages of the facility. Our engineering and design services offering includes three engagements: CSP, ICD, and MEP.

● | CSP revolves around early-stage engagement with stakeholders and provides for a basis of design that optimizes for interactions between people, plants and processes, saving stakeholders money and time, immediately and in the future, through smart, informed decision-making. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ICD revolves around professionally designed layouts for climate control, fertigation, benching, air flow and lighting, together ensuring optimal space utilization and product performance. These detailed plans are taken through the Construction Document stage and are leveraged by our clients to efficiently solicit contractor bids. 
● | MEP engineering design focuses on the gross square footage of the building, not just the cultivation space, which in turn eliminates the “gap” between cultivation systems and the building systems. We provide engineered construction contract documents for mechanical, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”), plumbing and electrical systems required for the building permits necessary to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy. 

Our Service Offering
 
We provide value for clients in the form of facility commissioning and staff training. Combined, this solution focuses on the troubleshooting, tuning, and support of a myriad of cultivation systems and equipment while further providing guidance for client interactions with tradespeople working on HVAC, electrical, and plumbing in the facility.

-


Many of the current service options available to clients are isolated to vendors providing post-sale service for a single piece of equipment – whereas our service has a cultivation-level view of the complex system made up by each piece of equipment.
 
Training Services. Complex cultivation systems encompass a multitude of variables and environment readings such as temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure differential (VPD), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, network status, light status, photosynthetically active radiation, sunrise/sunset modules, CO2, HVAC status, fan status, vents (including windward and leeward), shades, network status and flow rates. In our CEA world there is a scarcity of skilled labor which impedes our clients’ ability to drive operating proficiency across their teams. Our engineering team uses a series of tools and processes to ensure clients are proactive in preventing equipment downtime, can operate all equipment and processes fluently, and have expert support in resolving potential issues. These services range from equipment standard operating procedure (“SOP”) libraries to staff training sessions. With a unique knowledgebase acquired from both our commissioning and training for a wide breadth of cultivation equipment, we provide our clients’ teams with the skills to minimize equipment downtime and optimize processes in their facilities.
 
Facility and Equipment Commissioning Services. Today’s cultivation systems are custom designed and extremely complex. Our team of project managers and engineers supports the installation process by coordinating with a client’s engineers and stakeholders to avoid project bottlenecks while supporting construction trades. Our commissioning team ensures that the equipment is installed according to the design and operates per the defined manufacturer specifications.
 
Program Overview and Pricing. We estimate that, on average and depending on the crop, CEA facilities can lose up to $10,000 per 1,000 square feet of canopy per day when offline – our training services are centered around proactively minimizing this potential loss for a fraction of the cost. Our clients are best described as automation- and margin-focused and have an understanding of the importance of preventing downtime in their facilities.
 
Related-Party Hardware and Software Platforms. Since initially collaborating with California-based Edyza Corporation (“Edyza”) in 2018, our multiple investments have culminated into a 19.5% equity position in Edyza. Edyza’s IoT platform employs a robust, high performance, proprietary, tree-mesh wireless network topology and utilizes wireless hardware sensors to acquire data within the cultivation environment. Our training services can help clients utilize the data garnered from these sensors to provide a high-resolution understanding of what’s happening within a client’s facility through detailed multi-point information on temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, soil moisture, and electrical conductivity.
 
Integrated Equipment Solutions
 
While our engineers play an integral part in the design of most of the complex equipment systems that are then integrated into a CEA facility, we also provide consultative reselling of more common solutions that we integrate into the overall design. For CEA, the environmental goal is to maintain a stable and consistent VPD according to the client’s priorities through environmental control of relative humidity and temperature during all stages of growth. There are four main variables in CEA that affect plant growth (and can impact VPD): (i) water and nutrients; (ii) environmental control; (iii) CO2; and (iv) lighting.


Design, Source, and Integration of Complex Environmental Equipment Systems
 
Complex Environment Systems for CEA include the integration of environmental controls, fertigation and irrigation distribution, a complete line of water treatment and wastewater reclamation systems, and purpose-built HVAC equipment systems.
 
The most significant variable of interest in a CEA facility is the control of the environment, which is accomplished through the integration of both environmental controls and the purpose-built HVAC system. Without proper design, the environmental control system is the most influential variable in terms of temperature and relative humidity control within an indoor agriculture space. With properly designed equipment, the environmental controls variable is less volatile, enabling efficient growing conditions.

Purpose-built HVAC equipment systems will provide a more stable environment, maximize plant health and yields, minimize crop loss, minimize utility costs, save on capital equipment, and maximize sustainability. Additionally, private studies of a partner comparing purpose-built HVAC environmental controls equipment to standard commercial HVAC and dehumidification, found increased crop yields with purpose-built equipment.
 
VAR of Cultivation Equipment Systems
 
We act as an experienced VAR to our clients when selling vetted best-in-class commercial horticulture lighting solutions, rolling and automated container benching systems, specialty fans, and microbial mitigation and odor reduction systems. The acquired knowledge of how each of these systems work in combination with and in tangent to the overall ecosystem is a significant benefit that our engineers and product experts offer to our clients. Not only are many competing products reviewed in each category with the intention of vetting the best solution, we continually search out and review competing technologies to ensure that only the best-in-class equipment systems are integrated into our projects. As such, we believe it will be imperative to maintain and to continue to develop close relationships with both existing and new leading technology and manufacturing providers.
 
Today, we typically do not sell any cultivation equipment systems individually as a one-time sale. The majority of equipment sales are sold as part of a larger all-encompassing project solution that spans over a 12 to 18 month period and includes engineering design and the sale of both custom complex and more standard equipment systems.


Strategic Vendor Relationships with Premier Manufacturers
 
We work closely with leading technology and manufacturing providers to deliver an integrated solution designed to achieve the stated objectives of our clients. While we previously manufactured certain lighting products, we discontinued all manufacturing in 2019, although we continued to sell existing inventory through 2020. Although we have numerous provider relationships, three vendors are particularly important to our solution: Fluence, Argus, and Desert Aire.

● | Fluence’s LED-based lighting systems are designed to provide high levels of photosynthetically active radiation ideal for commercial cultivation and research applications. From sole-source indoor grow lighting to supplemental greenhouse lighting, Fluence custom tailors the light spectrum and form-factors to optimize plant growth and increase yields while consuming less energy and reducing operating costs as compared to legacy technologies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | After working closely together since early 2019, we have demonstrated our value to Fluence by engaging with clients, and introducing their product line, up to 18 months prior to facility start-up. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Building on this success, in the second quarter of 2020, we signed an exclusive two-year global System Integrator Agreement with Fluence. 


● | Argus provides automated control systems for the horticulture and aquaculture industries. Argus systems provide three essential functions: (i) fully integrated equipment control; (ii) advanced monitoring and alarms; and (iii) comprehensive crop and environmental data acquisition and management information. Argus capabilities include facilities automation and specialty monitoring and control applications to support the needs of cultivators. Argus’ systems are used in horticulture and biotechnology research facilities, universities, aquaculture and aquaponics, and many other custom control applications at sites throughout the world. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | In the fourth quarter of 2019, we renewed our multi-year strategic agreement with Argus to provide cultivators in North America with industry-leading, plant-centric solutions for environmental control, automation, and nutrient management. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | We have worked with Argus on over 50 projects and the extended agreement demonstrates both companies’ commitment to client success through early and ongoing collaboration with cultivators throughout their project lifecycles.

We have not experienced any material changes in the availability of equipment systems and products from Fluence, Argus, or Desert Aire.
 
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
Sales Overview
 
Our sales team is comprised of one Executive Vice President, three Directors of Sales, one Sales Operations Manager, and one Sales Associate. The Directors of Sales, serving as “relationship ambassadors,” are located across the United States and are tasked with cultivating leads, generating and supporting sales, and managing client relationships.
 
With the experience garnered from providing engineering and design services to over 300 CEA projects, and our continued research on finding best-in-class complex equipment solutions, our clients choose to work with us because our team custom tailors a solution to address the client’s unique combination of process flow, complex environmental systems, cultivation equipment solutions, and any potential sensitivities of the crop.
 
When potential clients express an interest in our solution, we provide them with a technical expert, referred to as a sales engineer, who can quickly and effectively explain a proposed solution to resolve the client’s specific challenges. We believe this technical sales process requires true segment expertise, which we also believe has not been readily available to indoor cultivators. Our team includes talented and experienced individuals including licensed Professional Engineers, as well as individuals with Masters Degrees in Business Administration, Plant Science, Horticulture, and post-secondary degrees in Environmental Science, Horticulture, Agricultural Engineering, and Electrical/Mechanical/Controls Engineering. We leverage these technical experts in their areas of expertise to continually find and vet what we believe are the best-in-class solutions, and then educate and inform our clients on best solution use and techniques.
 
In addition to leads generated from the execution of our marketing strategy, for additional new business opportunities, we focus on referrals generated from our relationships with industry partners and from contract referral agents. By offering a referral program to consultants whose primary business model is to help their clients set up cultivation facilities from the design stage through cultivation, we ensure access to a strong network of cultivators.
 
Sales Cycle and Average Revenues and Gross Margins
 
We generate revenue and profits based on selling engineering design and managed services, customized environmental and cultivation equipment systems, and consumable products once facilities are operational.
 
Sales Cycle. At the outset of a client design project, we utilize a proprietary project estimation tool that accounts for multiple variables relating to the size and complexity of the new or retrofitted facility. This tool optimizes the facility layout, taking into consideration the initial costs of all custom cultivation equipment systems as well as the ongoing operational costs associated with labor and utilities required to move the crop, in order to establish a facility that meets the objectives of the client. After the project estimate is determined, a design fee and project deposit are determined. The design fee is dependent on the desired design services and on the complexity of the overall project, including facility and canopy size, type and complexity of controls and irrigation distribution system, which is dependent on number of irrigation zones, types of nutrients, and the number of individual plants that require irrigation. We provide our solution pursuant to a contract that typically requires a project design deposit equal to 50% of the project estimate, with the remaining balance due prior to delivery of the construction documents, which collectively takes, approximately twelve months.

-


Following the design stage, we contract with clients to procure and sell customized equipment systems. To begin the procurement process, we charge a deposit ranging from 20% to 50% of total cost, which varies based on lead time, complexity, and the type of systems. After the procurement window, which ranges from one week to five months to allow for the manufacturing and assembly of systems, we charge a final shipment payment for the balance owed, which is due within two weeks of system readiness and prior to shipment. Following installation of the systems, we dispatch an engineering team for commissioning they systems.
 
Once the client’s facility is operational, we are able to support the client’s ongoing operations by selling consumable products to ensure the facilities function at optimal performance.
 
Revenues and Gross Profit Margins by Category. Service Revenues for engineering design services contracts can be hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the spectrum of services desired by the client and the size of the facility. Product Revenues for customized equipment systems can be millions of dollars, depending on the size of the cultivation facilities, the complexity and types of systems purchased by the client, and the number of systems purchased by the client. Sales of consumable products are typically of a recurring nature each month to a client and can be in the tens of thousands of dollars.
 
Targeted gross profit margins for each of the Company’s revenue categories are as follows:
 

● | Engineering design services – thirty to sixty percent; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Customized equipment systems - mid-teens to mid-thirty percent; and 
● | Consumable products revenues - high-teens to high-twenty percent. 

 
Gross profit margins on engineering design services and customized equipment systems are highly dependent on the complexity and size of the project.
 
Our Clients
 
We primarily market and sell our products and services to CEA operators and facilitators in the United States and Canada. Our historical client base has been comprised of indoor commercial cultivators seeking to grow high-quality cannabis crops. Since launching the engineering and design division in 2018, we have designed and assisted in the build-out of 300+ projects for some of the largest independent and multi-state operators in both the United States and Canada. Although the cannabis market has been our historical target market and an unknown but substantial portion of all of our revenues to date have been generated from clients in the cannabis industry, we are seeking to diversify our client base by expanding our reach within CEA. The term “plant-based medicines” includes (i) a wide array of herbal supplements including but not limited to curcumin, saffron extract and ginger, (ii) CBD based therapeutics, (iii) cannabis based therapeutics and (iv) a host of medicines derived from plans such as caffeine, menthol, foxglove and others. We are focusing on expanding to the vertical farming CEA sub-segment, which is ultimately and predominantly used for the cultivation of a variety of crops including, but not limited to, leafy greens, herbs, cucumbers, peppers, and strawberries. During 2020, we also continued exploring the potential demand for our solutions in select countries, including those within Latin America and Europe.
Marketing Strategy
 
We provide our clients with equipment and service solutions for their facility that empowers their success for the life of their grow — from early stage facility programming, engineering design, and the integration of complex equipment systems, through commissioning / facility start-up services. Our team of engineers and experts understand the highly regulated market, challenges, and opportunities unique to cultivators.
 
Marketing serves two general purposes at urban-gro – brand image and lead generation.
 
Brand Image
 
Our marketing strategy is to position urban-gro as a leading engineering and design services company that integrates complex environmental equipment systems into high-performance indoor CEA cultivation facilities for the global commercial horticulture market. Managing the clarity of our brand is a key component of supporting our organization’s growth initiatives and lead generation. We support our brand through (i) interviews, (ii) website, (iii) e-commerce, (iv) events, and (v) corporate responsibility.

Interviews. We retain a public relations firm to amplify our business objectives through earned media to support of our corporate activities and marketing functions. The focus of our publicity efforts is to engage and inform key audiences, build relationships, and provide vital feedback for analysis and action. Our spokespeople have received media training and are briefed prior to each interview.
 
Website. Our online experience supports our brand by being both educational and transactional. By applying an established set of key metrics, user activity on the website is used to generate Marketing Qualified Leads (“MQL”) to be passed to the sales team for engagement. With the technology advancements and market expansion into CEA, our website offers educational content for investors, managers, and cultivators to ensure they are considering key facility programming, design, and engineering aspects critical to high-performance buildings. Given our team’s early involvement with indoor cultivation, our experts are uniquely positioned to share knowledge, thereby qualifying us for future projects. As a lead-generation tool, the urban-gro website produces qualified, trackable sales leads. The leads move through the qualification and nurture process before being passed to sales and engaged by the appropriate contact for advancement through the sales funnel.
 
Events. In the era of COVID-19, events and tradeshows have changed dramatically. Now virtual experiences, we participate in select events promoting thought leadership through speaking and participation on panels. Event sponsorship is carefully evaluated with clear goals and objectives established ahead of time. Participation in events must meet the following four-part qualification criteria: 1) engaging with potential clients during and after the event, 2) building a network of collaborative design and construction firms across North America, 3) repurposing event content and delivering across our digital media platforms as curated content, and 4) continue to protect our brand, image and reputation as the thought and delivery leader in the CEA marketplace. According to Freeman, a top leader in event logistics, in-person events are anticipated to resume in the second quarter 2021 at the earliest. This is subject to change based upon the developments of COVID-19 in the spring of 2021.


Corporate Responsibility. We leverage our leadership position in the market as an opportunity to promote our corporate values of inclusion, innovation, and connection.
 

● | Inclusion: Internally, we hire and promote underrepresented communities in STEM (science, technology, education, mathematics). Our project design and engineering teams reflect our commitment as demonstrated by leadership positions held by women across our project design, project management, and client engagement departments. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy
 
Our employees and the application of their acquired knowledge is our most valuable asset as an organization. Our growth strategy involves leveraging this considerable strength as a basis for growth across three pillars of focus and exploration. These three pillars allow us to continue to provide value to our current and future clients:

1. | Expertise as a Service 
---+---------------------------------------------------------
2. | Expansion of Geographical Reach 
3. | Expansion within the Commercial Horticulture Segment 

 
1. Expertise as a Service
 
We have always aimed to provide the highest level of service and expertise to our clients from initial cultivation ideation to helping prior to go-live to proactively solve for issues that may arise once operations begin and continue at their facilities. Our commissioning and training services allow our clients to manage, operate and perform at the highest level throughout their entire cultivation lifecycle once they are up and running.
 
2. Expansion of Geographical Reach
 
While we will continue to establish our end-to-end solution as the industry standard for CEA indoor cultivation, we intend to continue to focus on integrating our expertise and service offerings with the best available technologies to allow our clients to achieve operational superiority and profitability. While we believe that the U.S. market will experience continued strength, and this will represent significant growth opportunities for us, we also intend to expand our reach within Europe.
 
European Expansion - Historically, our business has found success with clients in the United States and Canada. While North America currently presents the dominant opportunity for indoor new build and retrofit CEA facilities, the European CEA market, especially in the vertical farming sub-segment, is rapidly expanding.
 

11
--


We first entered the European market in early 2020, through key partners who have brought us into opportunities as a value-added component to their own sales cycle. We have demonstrated the transferability of our expertise to the EU and have closed several deals to provide value-added solution services to European clients. Further, in Switzerland, where the majority of our engineering and design contracts were signed, the plant-based medicines market (hemp-derived CBD) has shown a strong, positive response for our solutions. Based on our due diligence, we believe that the most common facilities in demand in this market will mirror that of our niche – indoor, CEA, GMP-certified operations. We will look to capitalize on our current approach and expand our reach into Europe with our services and products through a staged and cost-efficient approach by first entering the market through our strong partnerships and leveraging our existing U.S.-based engineering expertise and overhead.
 
The term “plant-based medicines” includes (i) a wide array of herbal supplements including but not limited to curcumin, saffron extract and ginger, (ii) CBD based therapeutics, (iii) cannabis based therapeutics and (iv) a host of medicines derived from plans such as caffeine, menthol, foxglove and others.
 
Approach to Market Expansion - Due to the rapid development of the European market and the lack of established companies experienced in the design, construction, and operations of indoor cultivation facilities, we will make a strategic and staged entry into the European market to ensure a sustainable use of resources and capital. The market entry will be designed around a three-phased approach:
 

● | Phase One – Focus on establishing a client base and pipeline surrounding early license applicants and current license holders by providing facility and systems design for indoor projects. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase Two – Building on established vendor relationships, integrate purpose-built custom environmental equipment systems from U.S. manufacturers into our European offering. 
● | Phase Three – Incorporate the development of the initial two phases combined with the partnerships, joint ventures, and domestic manufacturing of equipment to provide a turn-key project solution offering in Europe. 

 
We believe this three-phased approach, paired with the evolution of partnerships and domestic equipment manufacturing, will establish us as an experienced leader and solution provider in the design, engineering, and turn-key systems for the European indoor CEA market.
 
3. Expansion within the Commercial Horticulture Segment
 
Utilizing our in-house engineering capabilities and synergies, we confidently believe that we can efficiently expand our diversification to include working on projects in the CEA indoor vertical farming market segment in both the North American and European markets.
 
Global CEA Vertical Farming Segment - CEA vertical farm facilities for cultivation are typically indoor warehouse farms and plant factories that are in purpose-built or retrofitted facilities.
 
According to Allied Market Research, the global vertical farming market is estimated to reach $12.8 billion by 2026, with a compounded annual growth rate of 24.6% from 2019 to 2026. The market for non-container facilities—on which we already focus and have had success—is forecasted to grow even faster. This rate of growth forecast is buttressed by the fact that more and more food will be needed closer to where population resides, and CEA eliminates many of the risks of traditional agriculture, minimizing risk and allowing localities to be closer and control their food supply more readily.
 
Market Entry - Our end-to-end approach, solutions, and expertise are applicable for and valuable to clients creating high performance indoor vertical farms to cultivate high value crops such as leafy greens, micro-greens, herbs, peppers, or even floriculture. After studying the opportunity over the last two quarters, we see relatively few barriers to entry as:
 

● | our engineers’ design expertise in indoor CEA seamlessly flows through to indoor vertical farming facilities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our experts’ backgrounds are predominantly built on a commercial horticulture foundation; and 


12
--


● | our acquired expertise in engineering over 300 indoor CEA projects with the highest valued crop in the world will allow us to design high performance vertical farms. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our approach to entering this market will follow what we have done as we entered Europe – we will continue to reinforce our core strengths as we expand into new markets through our partnerships. The first phase of entering this CEA market will be as a value-add to our partners who already successfully sell to this market in North America. As we find success here, we will look to continue to partner to accelerate our reach and begin to supply much of the equipment needed to build out a facility, and finally, after identifying and solving for any potential gaps, we will look to offer turn-key, end-to-end design, engineer, and build services for indoor CEA facilities.
 
Acquisition Strategy - While entering any new market can be challenging, we believe that our existing brand combined with the strength of our partnerships and expertise will allow us to capture a meaningful amount of this market through targeting the most sophisticated, well-funded producers who are in need of a partner that has a demonstrated history of success growing crops in this way.
 
To speed up our expansion plan, and with the intention of forming strategic relationships to assist in lead generation, we plan to place investments in or acquire horticulture-related positive cash flow entities at discounted prices based upon the synergistic upside available for both organizations.

While we feel that our complex end-to-end solution places us as a leader in the CEA segment, we do face competition from companies that offer some, but not all, portions of an all-encompassing facility package. Further, these companies often outsource to third parties for the integration and sale of equipment systems and products, particularly within the cannabis industry. We also compete with other smaller and mid-sized companies that focus primarily on either engineering design services or product sales. Within the services space, there are several product or services specific competitors that offer similar services, such as MEP services or basic fertigation design. Currently, we view our competition to be focused on equipment sales that are predominantly commodity “off-the-shelf” items like lighting and other cultivation staple products, both pre- and post-startup. This competition comes from traditional wholesale horticulture dealers, online retailers, and some manufacturers who sell direct.
 
Greenhouse manufacturers and European systems integrators may increasingly seek to offer comprehensive product and service solutions to compete with our integrated solution, but they are primarily focused on the greenhouse industry, and not on indoor CEA facilities. European systems integrators in particular are experienced and have a strong operating history in traditional horticulture and provide specialized, intensive, and large-scale solutions that revolve around greenhouse projects. Instead of competing with these integrators, we find ourselves working with them and combining synergies to work on projects together.
 
Further, although we frequently partner with direct manufacturers to deliver our customized solution, these manufacturers may seek to engage with clients directly to deliver their products. In addition, we sometimes compete with electrical contractors with respect to specific components of facility engineering and design.
 
As the cannabis market continues to mature and develop and legalization becomes more prevalent, we expect to see more competition from cannabis-focused agricultural product and service providers. Going forward, our focus is on non-cannabis crops. These companies may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger client bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. These competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential clients, employees, strategic partners, distribution channels and advertisers. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and a potential loss of market share.
 
Regulation
 
U.S. Regulations
 
While we do not generate any revenue from the direct sale of cannabis products, we have historically, and may continue to, offer our solutions to indoor cultivators that are engaged in various aspects of the cannabis industry. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws.

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
Previously, the Obama administration took the position that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The Trump administration revised this policy but made no major changes in enforcement. Specifically, Attorney General Sessions vacated the Cole Memorandum in favor of deferral of any enforcement of federal regulation to the individual states’ Department of Justice or U.S. Attorney. However, certain other protections remain in place via budgetary element embedment (the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, now referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment), which limits funding of any enforcement of anti-cannabis legislation. The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana to prevent:
 

● | the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana; 
● | the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states; 
● | state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
● | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
● | the growing of marijuana on public lands; and 
● | marijuana possession or use on federal property. 

 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, most federally chartered banks will not accept deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry generally bank with state-chartered banks and credit unions to provide banking to the industry.
 
Although cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in many states, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in a material adverse effects on our business and revenues. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent states from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. While this appropriations measure continued from 2016 through 2020, and remains in effect, continued re-authorization cannot be guaranteed. If this appropriations rider is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana laws would increase. However, state laws do not supersede the prohibitions set forth in the federal drug laws.
 
In order to participate in either the medical or adult use sides of the marijuana industry, all businesses and employees must obtain licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.

Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
 
Canadian Regulations
 
Summary of the Cannabis Act
 
On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act came into force as law with the effect of legalizing adult recreational use of cannabis across Canada. The Cannabis Act replaced the Access to Cannabis for Medicinal Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) and the Industrial Hemp Regulations, both of which came into force under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) (the “CDSA”), which previously permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for only those Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner. The ACMPR replaced the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (Canada) (the “MMPR”), which was implemented in June 2013. The MMPR replaced the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (Canada) (the “MMAR”) which was implemented in 2001. The MMPR and MMAR were initial steps in the Government of Canada’s legislative path towards the eventual legalization and regulating recreational and medical cannabis.
 
The Cannabis Act permits the recreational adult use of cannabis and regulates the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and related oil extracts in Canada, for both recreational and medical purposes. Under the Cannabis Act, Canadians who are authorized by their health care practitioner to use medical cannabis have the option of purchasing cannabis from one of the producers licensed by Health Canada and are also able to register with Health Canada to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or to designate an individual who is registered with Health Canada to produce cannabis on their behalf for personal medical purposes.
 
Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are able to purchase fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, and cannabis plants or seeds and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis, or the equivalent amount in fresh cannabis or cannabis oil. The Cannabis Act also permits households to grow a maximum of four cannabis plants. This limit applies regardless of the number of adults that reside in the household. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial and municipal governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retail and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act, such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption.
 
Provincial and territorial governments in Canada have made varying announcements on the proposed regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. For example, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Yukon and the Northwest Territories have chosen the government-regulated model for distribution, whereas Saskatchewan and Newfoundland & Labrador have opted for a private sector approach. Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Nunavut and British Columbia have announced plans to pursue a hybrid approach of public and private sale and distribution.

In connection with the new framework for regulating cannabis in Canada, the federal government has introduced new penalties under the Criminal Code (Canada), including penalties for the illegal sale of cannabis, possession of cannabis over the prescribed limit, production of cannabis beyond personal cultivation limits, taking cannabis across the Canadian border, giving or selling cannabis to a youth and involving a youth to commit a cannabis-related offence.
 
On July 11, 2018, the Canadian federal government published regulations in the Canada Gazette to support the Cannabis Act, including the Cannabis Regulations, the new Industrial Hemp Regulations, along with proposed amendments to the Narcotic Control Regulations and certain regulations under the Food and Drugs Act (Canada). The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations, among other things, outline the rules for the legal cultivation, processing, research, analytical testing, distribution, sale, importation and exportation of cannabis and hemp in Canada, including the various classes of licenses that can be granted, and set standards for cannabis and hemp products. The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations include strict specifications for the plain packaging and labelling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed production sites. The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations also maintain a distinct system for access to cannabis. With the Cannabis Act now in force, cannabis has ceased to be regulated under the CDSA and is instead regulated under the Cannabis Act, and both the ACMPR and the Industrial Hemp Regulations have been repealed effective October 17, 2018.
 
On June 7, 2018, Bill-C45 passed the third reading in the Senate with a number of amendments to the language of the Cannabis Act. More specifically, the Senate proposed:
 

● | establishing a committee of the Senate and a committee of the House of Commons to undertake a comprehensive review of the administration and operation of the Cannabis Act; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | assisting provinces and territories to facilitate the development of workplace impairment policies; 
● | allowing provinces to place restrictions on the ability of individuals to engage in home cultivation; 
● | that law enforcement be provided with the appropriate tools and resources to address concerns about continued illicit production, diversion, and sale of cannabis to youth, including preventing the sharing of marihuana among young adults by rendering it a ticketable offense; 
● | that the prices set for cannabis products and the applicable taxes reflect the dual objective of minimizing the health dangers of cannabis consumption and undercutting the illicit market of cannabis; 
● | mandatory health warnings for cannabis products, including warnings about the danger of smoking cannabis, the danger of exposure to second-hand cannabis smoke, and the risks of combining cannabis and tobacco; 
● | testing procedures for THC content be standardized to ensure accurate measurement to better protect consumer health and safety; 
● | that forthcoming regulations for edible products and other forms of cannabis ensure that product packaging is child-resistant and does not appeal to young people, and that the type of available products should be strictly limited; 
● | adequate and ongoing funding for sustained, evidence-based cannabis education and prevention programs to provide Canadians, especially young Canadians, with knowledge about the health risks of cannabis use, including on-going research initiatives on the impact of cannabis use on the developing brain; and that the federal government commit to on-going educational initiatives to ensure youth are informed on the effects of cannabis use; 
● | to prohibit licensees under the Cannabis Act to distribute branded merchandise, such as t-shirts and baseball caps and imposing a moratorium on loosening the regulations on the branding, marketing, and promotion of cannabis for 10 years; 
● | to set aggressive targets, comparable to the successful Federal Tobacco Control Strategy, to reduce the number of youth and adult cannabis users; and 
● | to ensure that the Cannabis Tracking System be operational upon the coming-into-force of the Cannabis Act. 

 
Security Clearances - The Cannabis Regulations require that certain people associated with cannabis licensees, including individuals occupying a “key position” directors, officers, large stockholders and individuals identified by the Minister of Health, must hold a valid security clearance issued by the Minister of Health. Officers and directors of a parent corporation must be security cleared.

Under the Cannabis Regulations, the Minister of Health may refuse to grant security clearances to individuals with associations to organized crime or with past convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption or violent offences. Individuals who have histories of nonviolent, lower-risk criminal activity (for example, simple possession of cannabis, or small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants) are not precluded from participating in the legal cannabis industry, and the grant of security clearance to such individuals is at the discretion of the Minister of Health and such applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
 
Cannabis Tracking System - Under the Cannabis Act, the Minister of Health is authorized to establish and maintain a national cannabis tracking system. The Cannabis Regulations set out a national cannabis tracking system to track cannabis throughout the supply chain to help prevent diversion of cannabis into, and out of, the illicit market. The Cannabis Regulations also provides the Minister of Health with the authority to make a ministerial order that would require certain persons named in such order to report specific information about their authorized activities with cannabis, in the form and manner specified by the Minister of Health.
 
Cannabis Products - The Cannabis Regulations set out the requirements for the sale of cannabis products at the retail level permit the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in such forms as “pre-rolled” and in capsules. The THC content and serving size of cannabis products is limited by the Cannabis Regulations. The sale of edibles containing cannabis and cannabis concentrates was not initially permitted, however the federal government anticipates that such products will be legalized within one year following the coming into force of the Cannabis Act.
