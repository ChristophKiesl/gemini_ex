Item 1.    Business
General
We are an independent crude oil and natural gas company formed in 1967 engaged in the exploration, development, management, and production of crude oil and natural gas and associated products in the North, South and East regions of the United States. Additionally, we pursue the acquisition and management of perpetually owned minerals located in our key operating areas. 
During 2021 we executed strategic acquisitions to expand our operations into the Permian Basin of Texas and the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. See the subsequent section titled Acquisition Activities as well as Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information on these acquisitions. 
Our North region consists of properties north of Kansas and west of the Mississippi River and includes North Dakota Bakken, Montana Bakken, Powder River Basin, and the Red River units. Our South region includes all properties south of Nebraska and west of the Mississippi River and includes the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma and the Permian Basin of Texas. Our East region is primarily comprised of undeveloped leasehold acreage east of the Mississippi River with no significant drilling or production operations.
Our operations in the North region comprised 55% of our crude oil and natural gas production and 63% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Approximately 46% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 are located in the North region. Our operations in the South region comprised 45% of our crude oil and natural gas production, 37% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues, and 54% of our proved reserves as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.
We focus our activities in large crude oil and natural gas plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions and apply our geologic and operational expertise to drill and develop properties at attractive rates of return. We have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where three dimensional seismic, horizontal drilling, geosteering technologies, advanced completion technologies (e.g., fracture stimulation), pad/row development, and enhanced recovery technologies allow us to develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations. As a result of these efforts, we have grown substantially through the drill bit. We also grew in 2021 through the strategic acquisitions described below under Part I, Item 1. Business—Acquisition Activities. From January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, proved reserves added through extensions, discoveries and other additions totaled 828 MMBoe and proved reserves added through property acquisitions totaled 252 MMBoe. 
As of December 31, 2021, our proved reserves were 1,645 MMBoe, with proved developed reserves representing 908 MMBoe, or 55%, of our total proved reserves. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled $16.64 billion at December 31, 2021. For 2021, we generated crude oil and natural gas revenues of $5.79 billion and operating cash flows of $3.97 billion. Crude oil accounted for 49% of our total production and 68% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for 2021. Our total production averaged 329,647 Boe per day for 2021, an increase of 10% compared to 2020. 
The table below summarizes our total proved reserves, PV-10 (non-GAAP) and net producing wells as of December 31, 2021 and our average daily production for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 for our principal operating areas. The PV-10 values shown below are not intended to represent the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates.

(1)PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $3.86 billion. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion.
(2)The presentation of average daily 2021 fourth quarter production represents production during the period from the closing of our acquisition of Permian properties on December 21, 2021 through December 31, 2021 averaged over 92 days in the fourth quarter. At the time of closing, our Permian properties produced on average approximately 42,000 Boe per day based on two-stream reporting. 
Our Business Strategies
Our business strategies continue to be focused on generating significant shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at low costs and attractive rates of return. For 2022, our primary business strategies will include:
•Continuing to exercise capital and operational discipline to maximize cash flow generation and competitive returns on capital employed; 
•Reducing outstanding debt and maintaining a strong balance sheet to enhance financial flexibility;
•Maintaining strong shareholder alignment by maximizing capital and corporate returns to shareholders;
•Developing our recently acquired properties in the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin by applying our geologic and operational expertise; 
•Maintaining low-cost, capital efficient operations; and
•Driving continued improvement in our health, safety, and environmental performance and governance programs.
Our Business Strengths
We have a number of strengths to allow us to successfully execute our business strategies, including the following:
Large acreage inventory with access to both crude oil and natural gas resources. We held approximately 538,400 net undeveloped acres and 1.40 million net developed acres under lease as of December 31, 2021 concentrated in core areas of premier U.S. resource plays that provide optionality and access to crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. 
Expertise with pad and row development, horizontal drilling, and optimized completion methods. We have substantial experience with horizontal drilling and optimized completion methods and continue to be among industry leaders in the use of new drilling and completion technologies. We continue to improve drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multi-well pad and row development strategies. Further, we are among industry leaders in drilling long lateral lengths. We have also been among industry leaders in testing and utilizing optimized completion technologies involving various combinations of fluid types, proppant types and volumes, and stimulation stage spacing to determine optimal methods for improving recoveries and rates of return. We continually refine our drilling and completion techniques in an effort to deliver improved results across our properties. 
Control operations over a substantial portion of our assets and investments. As of December 31, 2021, we operated properties comprising 89% of our total proved reserves. By controlling a significant portion of our operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and completion methods used. Additionally, we capitalize on our geologic knowledge and land expertise to strategically acquire minerals in areas of future growth, thereby allowing us to enhance cash flows and project economics through the alignment of mineral ownership with our drilling schedule. Further, we continue to grow our significant portfolio of water gathering, recycling, and disposal infrastructure assets which allow for uninterrupted flow back and recycling capabilities, supports timely completion activities, and generates additional service revenues and cash flows. Our strategies for growing our mineral ownership portfolio and water infrastructure assets serve as additional avenues to generate shareholder value.
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry and with operating in challenging commodity price environments. Our Chairman of the Board, Harold G. Hamm, began his career in the oil and gas industry in 1967. Our 9 executive officers have an average of 40 years of oil and gas industry experience.
Financial Position and Liquidity. We have a credit facility with lender commitments totaling $2.0 billion that matures in October 2026. We had approximately $1.76 billion of borrowing availability on our credit facility at January 31, 2022 after considering outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. Our credit facility is unsecured and does not have a borrowing base requirement that is subject to periodic redetermination based on changes in commodity prices and proved reserves. Additionally, downgrades or other negative rating actions with respect to our credit rating do not trigger a reduction in our current credit facility commitments, nor do such actions trigger a security requirement or change in covenants.
Acquisition Activities
We regularly seek to acquire oil and gas properties that complement our operations, provide exploration and development opportunities, and provide enhanced cash flows and corporate returns. On December 21, 2021, we acquired oil and gas properties and related assets in the Permian Basin of Texas from certain subsidiaries of Pioneer Natural Resources Company for $3.06 billion of cash, representing a $3.25 billion purchase price less customary closing adjustments. The properties included approximately 92,000 net leasehold acres, approximately 50,000 net royalty acres in the same area normalized to a 1/8th royalty, production totaling approximately 42,000 Boe per day (~78% oil) based on two-stream reporting at the time of closing, and extensive water infrastructure. We funded the purchase price and related transaction costs through a combination of cash on hand, utilization of credit facility borrowing capacity, and the issuance of senior notes. 
Additionally, in March 2021 and November 2021 we executed strategic acquisitions to expand our operations into the Powder River Basin of Wyoming for aggregate cash consideration of $453 million and, on January 24, 2022, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire additional oil and gas properties in the Powder River Basin for $450 million of cash, the closing of which is expected to occur in late March 2022 and remains subject to the completion of customary due diligence procedures and closing conditions. See Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Property Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 20. Subsequent Events for additional information on the above acquisitions.
As a result of our acquisitions in the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin we now have substantial strategic positions in four leading basins in the United States, providing our Company and shareholders with enhanced geologic and geographic diversity and commodity optionality. We believe these transactions will be accretive on financial metrics and will complement our existing deep portfolio of assets in the Bakken and Oklahoma. We expect enhanced cash flows from the acquisitions will provide continued support for additional returns to shareholders via debt reduction, dividend increases, share repurchases, and increased returns on capital employed. 
Information on the proved reserves and leasehold acreage associated with our new positions in the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin as of December 31, 2021 is presented in the tables that follow. 
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations
Proved Reserves
Proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates renewal is reasonably certain. In connection with the estimation of proved reserves, the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence the quantities of crude oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. To achieve reasonable certainty, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott Company, L.P (“Ryder Scott”), our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps including isopach and structure maps, analogy and statistical analysis, and available downhole, production, seismic, and well test data.
The table below sets forth estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves information by reserve category as of December 31, 2021. Proved reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests are not material relative to our consolidated reserves and are not separately presented herein. The standardized measure of our discounted future net cash flows totaled approximately $16.64 billion at December 31, 2021. Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2021 are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. In preparing its report, Ryder Scott evaluated properties representing approximately 98% of our PV-10 and 98% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021. Our internal technical staff evaluated the remaining properties. A copy of Ryder Scott’s summary report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, Standardized Measure and PV-10 at December 31, 2021 were determined using the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the period of January 2021 through December 2021, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the lives of the properties. These prices were $66.56 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.60 per MMBtu for natural gas ($62.19 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.46 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). These average prices are significantly higher than 2020 levels, which resulted in significant upward price-related revisions to proved reserves in 2021, as further discussed below.
The following table summarizes our estimated proved reserves by commodity and reserve classification as of December 31, 2021. 

 | Crude Oil(MBbls) | Natural Gas(MMcf) | | Total(MBoe) | PV-10 (1)(in millions)

Proved reserves at end of year | 1,645,310 | | 1,103,762 | | 1,619,265

Revisions of previous estimates. Revisions for 2021 are comprised of (i) upward price revisions of 92 MMBo and 458 Bcf (totaling 168 MMBoe) due to the significant increase in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting from the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the resumption of normal economic activity, and the resulting improvement in supply and demand fundamentals, (ii) the removal of 31 MMBo and 155 Bcf (totaling 57 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to continual refinement of our drilling and development programs and reallocation of capital to areas providing the best opportunities to improve efficiencies, recoveries, and rates of return, (iii) downward revisions of 12 MMBo and 263 Bcf (totaling 56 MMBoe) from the removal of PUD reserves due to changes in anticipated well densities, economics, performance, and other factors, and (iv) downward revisions for oil reserves of 35 MMBo and upward revisions for natural gas reserves of 195 Bcf (netting to 2 MMBoe of downward revisions) due to changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors.
Extensions, discoveries and other additions. Extensions, discoveries and other additions for each of the three years reflected in the table above were due to successful drilling and completion activities and continual refinement of our drilling programs. Proved reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 202 MMBoe, 41 MMBoe, and 160 MMBoe for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while reserve additions in Oklahoma totaled 169 MMBoe, 50 MMBoe, and 205 MMBoe for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. See the subsequent section titled Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects for a discussion of our 2021 drilling activities. 
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of proved reserves in the past three years. 
Purchases of minerals in place. Purchases in 2021 were primarily attributable to our acquisitions of properties in the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin described above. Proved reserves acquired in the Permian Basin totaled 149 MMBo and 326 Bcf (totaling 203 MMBoe) and proved reserves acquired in the Powder River Basin totaled 26 MMBo and 46 Bcf (totaling 34 MMBoe). We had no individually significant acquisitions of proved reserves in 2020 and 2019.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2021 are located in our most active development areas. The following table provides information regarding changes in our PUD reserves for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our PUD reserves at December 31, 2021 include 68 MMBoe of reserves associated with wells where drilling has occurred but the wells have not been completed or are completed but not producing ("DUC wells"). Our DUC wells are classified as PUD reserves when relatively major expenditures are required to complete and produce from the wells. 
 | Crude Oil(MBbls) | Natural Gas(MMcf) | | Total(MBoe)
Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020 | 215,069 | | 1,567,713 | | 476,355 
Revisions of previous estimates | (45,340) | | (329,237) | | (100,214)
Extensions, discoveries and other additions | 157,384 | | 1,183,484 | | 354,631 
Sales of minerals in place | — | | — | | — 
Purchases of minerals in place | 77,399 | | 150,985 | | 102,563 
Conversion to proved developed reserves | (35,135) | | (363,413) | | (95,703) 
Proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021 | 369,377 | | 2,209,532 | | 737,632 

Revisions of previous estimates. As previously discussed, in 2021 we removed 31 MMBo and 155 Bcf (totaling 57 MMBoe) of PUD reserves no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years of initial booking due to continual refinement of our drilling and development programs and reallocation of capital to areas providing the best opportunities to improve efficiencies, recoveries, and rates of return. Of these removals, 25 MMBo and 53 Bcf (totaling 34 MMBoe) was related to Bakken properties and 6 MMBo and 102 Bcf (totaling 23 MMBoe) was related to Oklahoma properties. Additionally, changes in anticipated well densities, economics, performance, and other factors resulted in downward PUD reserve revisions of 12 MMBo and 263 Bcf (totaling 56 MMBoe) in 2021. The significant increases in average crude oil and natural gas prices in 2021 resulted in upward price revisions of 15 MMBo and 73 Bcf (totaling 27 MMBoe). Finally, changes in ownership interests, operating costs, anticipated production, and other factors resulted in downward revisions for oil PUD reserves of 17 MMBo and net upward revisions for natural gas PUD reserves of 16 Bcf (totaling a net downward revision of 15 MMBoe) in 2021.
Extensions, discoveries and other additions. Extensions, discoveries and other additions were due to successful drilling activities and continual refinement of our drilling and development programs. PUD reserve additions in the Bakken totaled 133 MMBo and 359 Bcf (totaling 193 MMBoe) in 2021, while PUD reserve additions in Oklahoma totaled 24 MMBo and 824 Bcf (totaling 161 MMBoe). 
Sales of minerals in place. We had no individually significant dispositions of PUD reserves in 2021.
Purchases of minerals in place. Purchases in 2021 were primarily attributable to our acquisitions of properties in the Permian Basin and Powder River Basin described above. PUD reserves acquired in the Permian Basin totaled 65 MMBo and 130 Bcf (totaling 87 MMBoe) and PUD reserves acquired in the Powder River Basin totaled 12 MMBo and 21 Bcf (totaling 16 MMBoe).
Conversion to proved developed reserves. In 2021, we developed approximately 24% of our PUD locations and 20% of our PUD reserves booked as of December 31, 2020 through the drilling and completion of 269 gross (137 net) development wells at an aggregate capital cost of approximately $508 million incurred in 2021. 
Development plans. We have acquired substantial leasehold positions in our key operating areas. Our drilling programs to date in our historical operating areas have focused on proving our undeveloped leasehold acreage through strategic drilling, thereby increasing the amount of leasehold acreage in the secondary term of the lease with no further drilling obligations (i.e., categorized as held by production) and resulting in a reduced amount of leasehold acreage in the primary term of the lease. While we may opportunistically drill strategic exploratory wells, a substantial portion of our future capital expenditures will be focused on developing our PUD locations, including our drilled but not completed locations. Our inventory of DUC wells classified as PUDs total 259 gross (83 net) operated and non-operated locations at December 31, 2021 and represent 9% of our PUD reserves at that date. The costs to drill our uncompleted wells were incurred prior to December 31, 2021 and only the remaining completion costs are included in future development plans. 
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUD reserves at December 31, 2021 are projected to be approximately $1.2 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2023, $1.7 billion in 2024, $1.7 billion in 2025, and $1.2 billion in 2026. These capital expenditure projections have been established based on an expectation of drilling and completion costs, available cash flows, borrowing capacity, and the commodity price environment in effect at the time of preparing our reserve estimates and may be adjusted as market conditions evolve. Development of our existing PUD reserves at December 31, 2021 is expected 
to occur within five years of the date of initial booking of the PUDs. PUD reserves not expected to be drilled within five years of initial booking because of changes in business strategy or for other reasons have been removed from our reserves at December 31, 2021. We had no PUD reserves at December 31, 2021 that remain undrilled beyond five years from the date of initial booking. 
Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
Ryder Scott, our independent reserves evaluation consulting firm, estimated, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC, 98% of our PV-10 and 98% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 included in this Form 10-K. The Ryder Scott technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Refer to Exhibit 99 included with this Form 10-K for further discussion of the qualifications of Ryder Scott personnel.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserves engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team is in contact regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott’s preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. Proved reserves information is reviewed by our Audit Committee with representatives of Ryder Scott and by our internal technical staff before the information is filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. Additionally, certain members of our senior management review and approve the Ryder Scott reserves report and on a semi-annual basis review any internal proved reserves estimates.
Our Vice President—Corporate Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, an MBA in Finance and 37 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations, acquisitions, engineering and evaluations. He has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering most of his career and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Vice President—Corporate Reserves reports directly to our Vice Chairman of Strategic Growth Initiatives. The reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by certain members of the Company's executive management.
Proved Reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 Sensitivities
Our year-end 2021 proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 estimates were prepared using 2021 average first-day-of-the-month prices of $66.56 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.60 per MMBtu for natural gas ($62.19 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.46 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than those used in our year-end estimates. 
Provided below are sensitivities illustrating the potential impact on our estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 at December 31, 2021 under different commodity price scenarios for crude oil and natural gas. In these sensitivities, all factors other than the commodity price assumption have been held constant for each well. These sensitivities do not take into account a potential increase in our drilling activities and associated booking of additional proved reserves that may occur at higher commodity prices and there is no assurance the outcomes reflected below will be realized. 
The crude oil price sensitivities provided below show the impact on proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 under certain crude oil price scenarios, with natural gas prices being held constant at the 2021 average first-day-of-the-month price of $3.60 per MMBtu.

The natural gas price sensitivities provided below show the impact on proved reserves, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 under certain natural gas price scenarios, with crude oil prices being held constant at the 2021 average first-day-of-the-month price of $66.56 per Bbl.

Summary of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties and Projects
In the following discussion, we review our budgeted number of wells and capital expenditures for 2022 in our key operating areas. Our 2022 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be funded from operating cash flows. Our drilling and completion activities and the actual amount and timing of our capital expenditures may differ materially from our budget as a result of, among other things, available cash flows, unbudgeted acquisitions, actual drilling and completion results, the availability of drilling and completion rigs and other services and equipment, the availability of transportation and processing capacity, changes in commodity prices, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. We monitor our capital spending closely based on actual and projected cash flows and may scale back our spending should commodity prices materially decrease from current levels. 
The following table provides information regarding well counts and budgeted capital expenditures for 2022.

North Region 
Our properties in the North region represented 46% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 and 55% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our principal producing properties in the North region are located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana and our recently acquired properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.
Bakken Field
The Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana is one of the largest crude oil resource plays in the United States. We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in the Bakken. As of December 31, 2021, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in the Bakken with approximately 1.2 million gross (771,900 net) acres under lease. 
Our total Bakken production averaged 175,585 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2021, down 4% from the 2020 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our average daily Bakken production increased 7% compared to 2020, reflecting the impact of voluntary production curtailments in 2020 and additional drilling and completion activities in 2021. In 2021, we participated in the drilling and completion of 252 gross (102 net) wells in the Bakken compared to 188 gross (77 net) wells in 2020. Our 2021 activities in the Bakken focused on ongoing multi-zone unit development in core areas of the play. 
Our Bakken properties represented 43% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2021 and 52% of our average daily Boe production for the 2021 fourth quarter. Our total proved Bakken field reserves as of December 31, 2021 were 708 MMBoe, an increase of 39% compared to December 31, 2020 primarily due to reserves added from our drilling program and upward reserve revisions prompted by improved commodity prices. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in the Bakken totaled 1,254 gross (701 net) wells as of December 31, 2021.
For 2022, our budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in the Bakken is $800 million. In 2022, we plan to average approximately six operated rigs and two well completion crews in the Bakken and expect to have first production on 264 gross (116 net) operated and non-operated wells during the year. Our 2022 drilling and completion activities in the Bakken will continue to focus on multi-zone unit development in areas that provide opportunities to improve capital efficiency, reduce finding and development costs, improve recoveries and rates of return, and maximize cash flows.
Powder River Basin
Our production in the Powder River Basin averaged 7,189 Boe per day for the fourth quarter of 2021. During 2021, we participated in the drilling and completion of 10 gross (8 net) wells in the play. Our Powder River properties represented 2% of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2021 and 2% of our average daily Boe production for the 2021 fourth quarter. Our proved reserves in the play totaled 32 MMBoe as of December 31, 2021 and our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations totaled 55 gross (34 net) wells.
For 2022, our budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in the Powder River Basin is $200 million. In 2022, we plan to average approximately two operated rigs and one well completion crew in the play and expect to have first production on 34 gross (20 net) operated and non-operated wells during the year. 
South Region
Our properties in the South region represented 54% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 and 45% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our principal producing properties in the South region are located in the SCOOP and STACK areas of Oklahoma and our recently acquired properties in the Permian Basin of Texas. 
Oklahoma
We are a leading producer, leasehold owner and operator in Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2021, we controlled one of the largest leasehold positions in Oklahoma with approximately 801,700 gross (448,300 net) acres under lease. 
Our properties in Oklahoma represented 41% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 and 43% of our average daily Boe production for the fourth quarter of 2021. Production in Oklahoma averaged 146,131 Boe per day during the fourth quarter of 2021, down 2% compared to the 2020 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2021, average daily production in Oklahoma increased 9% compared to 2020, reflecting the impact of voluntary production curtailments in 2020 and additional drilling and completion activities in 2021. We participated in the drilling and completion of 161 gross (63 net) wells in Oklahoma during 2021 compared to 145 gross (54 net) wells in 2020. Our proved reserves in Oklahoma as of December 31, 2021 totaled 679 MMBoe, an increase of 18% compared to December 31, 2020 primarily due to reserves added from our drilling program and upward reserve revisions prompted by improved commodity prices. Our inventory of proved undeveloped drilling locations in Oklahoma totaled 313 gross (170 net) wells as of December 31, 2021.
For 2022, our aggregate budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in Oklahoma is $400 million. In 2022, we plan to average approximately seven operated rigs and two well completion crews in Oklahoma and expect to have first production on 117 gross (41 net) operated and non-operated wells during the year. Our 2022 activities will focus on continued development in areas that provide opportunities to improve capital efficiency, reduce finding and development costs, improve recoveries and rates of return, and maximize cash flows.
Permian Basin
Proved reserves associated with our Permian Basin properties acquired in late 2021 totaled 203 MMBoe, representing 12% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021. Production from our Permian properties averaged approximately 42,000 Boe per day based on two-stream reporting during our short duration of ownership from December 21, 2021 to December 31, 2021. 
For 2022, our budget for exploration and development capital expenditures in the Permian Basin is $400 million. In 2022, we plan to average approximately four operated rigs and one well completion crew in the play and expect to have first production on 49 gross (46 net) operated and non-operated wells during the year.

Title to Properties
As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, upon initiation of acquiring oil and gas leases covering fee mineral interests on undeveloped lands which do not have associated proved reserves, contract landmen conduct a title examination of courthouse records and production databases to determine fee mineral ownership and availability. Title, lease forms and terms are reviewed and approved by Company landmen prior to consummation. 
For acquisitions from third parties, whether lands are producing crude oil and natural gas or non-producing, Company and contract landmen perform title examinations at applicable courthouses, obtain physical well site inspections, and examine the seller’s internal records (land, legal, operational, production, environmental, well, marketing and accounting) upon execution of a mutually acceptable purchase and sale agreement. Company landmen may also procure an acquisition title opinion from outside legal counsel on higher value properties. 
Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, Company landmen procure an original title opinion, or supplement an existing title opinion, from outside legal counsel and perform curative work to satisfy requirements pertaining to material title issues, if any. Company landmen will not approve commencement of drilling operations until material title defects pertaining to the Company’s interest are cured. 
The Company has cured material title opinion issues as to Company interests on substantially all of its producing properties and believes it holds at least defensible title to its producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The Company’s crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and leasehold burdens which do not materially interfere with the Company’s interest in the properties or affect the Company’s carrying value of such properties.
Marketing
We sell most of our operated crude oil production to crude oil refining companies or midstream marketing companies at major market centers. In the Bakken, Powder River, Permian, SCOOP, and STACK areas we have significant volumes of production directly connected to pipeline gathering systems, with the remaining production primarily transported by truck to a point on a pipeline system for further delivery. We do not transport any of our oil production prior to sale by rail, but several purchasers of our Bakken production are connected to rail delivery systems and may choose those methods to transport the oil they have purchased from us. We sell some operated crude oil production at the lease. Our share of crude oil production from non-operated properties is marketed at the discretion of the operators.
We sell most of our operated natural gas production to midstream customers at our lease locations based on market prices in the field where the sales occur, with the remaining production sold at centrally gathered locations or natural gas processing plants. These contracts include multi-year term agreements, many with acreage dedications. Under certain arrangements, we have the right to take a volume of processed residue gas and/or natural gas liquids ("NGLs") in-kind at the tailgate of the midstream customer's processing plant in lieu of a monetary settlement for the sale of our operated natural gas production. When we do take volumes in kind, we pay third parties to transport the residue gas volumes taken in kind to downstream delivery points, where we then sell to customers at prices applicable to those downstream markets. Sales at the downstream markets are mostly under daily and monthly packaged volumes deals, shorter term seasonal packages, and long term multi-year contracts. We continue to develop relationships and have the potential to enter into additional contracts with end-use customers, including utilities, industrial users, and liquefied natural gas exporters, for sale of products we elect to take in-kind in lieu of monetary settlement for our leasehold sales. Our share of natural gas production from non-operated properties is generally marketed at the discretion of the operators.
Environmental Stewardship
Throughout our operations, we seek to limit associated waste through emissions management and mitigation programs, increased recycling and re-use of produced water, and the use of footprint-reducing measures. Our environmental stewardship strategies, policies, and efforts are monitored by our Board of Directors’ Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee (“Committee”), which is the primary Committee responsible for overseeing and managing our ESG initiatives in respect of our business goals. Our focus on continuous improvement in ESG performance has resulted in sustained, year-over-year decreases since 2016 in both greenhouse gas and methane intensities. From 2019 through 2020, the most recent reporting year, we achieved a 28% decrease in greenhouse gas intensity and a 34% decrease in methane intensity. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate, and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for crude oil and 
natural gas properties, minerals, and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions economically in a highly competitive environment. In addition, as a result of depressed commodity prices in recent years, the number of providers of materials and services has decreased in the regions where we operate. Further, recent supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have led to shortages of certain materials and equipment and increased costs. As a result, the likelihood of experiencing competition and shortages of materials and services may be further increased in connection with any period of sustained commodity price recovery. Finally, the emerging impact of climate change activism, fuel conservation measures, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in energy generation devices may result in reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. 
Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry
All of our operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The crude oil and natural gas industry in the United States is subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Laws, rules, regulations, policies, and interpretations affecting our industry have been and are pervasive with the frequent imposition of new or increased requirements. These laws, regulations and other requirements often carry substantial penalties for failure to comply and may have a significant effect on our operations and may increase the cost of doing business and reduce our profitability. In addition, because public policy changes affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry are commonplace and because laws, rules and regulations may be enacted, amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws, rules and regulations. We do not expect future legislative or regulatory initiatives will affect us materially different than they will affect our similarly situated competitors.
The following is a discussion of certain significant laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, that may affect us in the areas in which we operate.
Regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids
Our physical sales of crude oil and any derivative instruments relating to crude oil are subject to anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). These laws, among other things, prohibit fraudulent or deceptive conduct in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. If we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we can be subject to substantial penalties and related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
We transport most of our operated crude oil production to market centers using a combination of trucks and pipeline transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration establishes safety regulations relating to transportation of crude oil by pipeline. Further, our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The transportation of crude oil and natural gas liquids ("NGLs") is subject to rate and access regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates interstate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and intrastate crude oil and NGL pipeline transportation rates may be subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. As the interstate and intrastate transportation rates we pay are generally applicable to all comparable shippers, the regulation of such transportation rates will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the effect on our similarly situated competitors.
Further, interstate pipelines and intrastate common carrier pipelines must provide service on an equitable basis and offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When such pipelines operate at full capacity we are subject to proration provisions, which are described in the pipelines’ published tariffs. We generally will have access to crude oil pipeline transportation services to the same extent as our similarly situated competitors.
From time to time we may sell our operated crude oil production at market centers in the United States to third parties who then subsequently export and sell the crude oil in international markets. The International Maritime Organization ("IMO"), an agency of the United Nations, has issued regulations requiring the maritime shipping industry to gradually reduce its carbon emissions over time by mandating a 1% improvement in the efficiency of fleets each year between 2015 and 2025. In conjunction with this initiative, the IMO issued regulations requiring ship owners to lower the concentration of the sulfur content used in their fuels from 3.5% to 0.5% beginning on January 1, 2020. To achieve and maintain compliance with the new regulations, it is expected ship owners will either have to switch to more expensive higher quality marine fuel, install and utilize 
emissions-cleaning systems, or switch to alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas. Failure to comply with the regulations may result in fines or shipping vessels being detained, thereby resulting in exportation capacity constraints that inhibit a third party's ability to transport and sell domestic crude oil production overseas, which may have a material impact on the markets and prices for various grades of domestic and international crude oil. The ultimate long-term impact of the IMO regulations is uncertain. 
We do not own or operate pipeline or rail transportation facilities, rail cars, or infrastructure used to facilitate the exportation of crude oil. However, regulations that impact the domestic transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at market centers throughout the United States. We do not expect such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated competitors.

We are also required to observe the aforementioned anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and CFTC in connection with physical sales of natural gas and any derivative instruments relating to natural gas. Additionally, the FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The FERC has endeavored to increase competition and make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis and has issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies. We cannot provide any assurance the pro-competitive regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe any action taken by the FERC will affect us in a materially different way than similarly situated natural gas producers.
The gathering of natural gas, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is generally regulated by the states. Although its policies on gathering systems have varied in the past, the FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the potential to increase costs for our purchasers and reduce the revenues we receive for our natural gas stream. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, equitable take requirements. We do not believe such regulations will affect us in a materially different way than our similarly situated competitors.
Intrastate natural gas transportation service is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers on a comparable basis, the regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation in states in which we operate will not affect us in a way that materially differs from our similarly situated competitors.
The U.S. Department of Energy (“U.S. DOE”) regulates the terms and conditions for the exportation and importation of natural gas (including liquefied natural gas or “LNG”). U.S. law provides for very limited regulation of exports to and imports from any country that has entered into a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) with the United States providing for national treatment of trade in natural gas; however, the U.S. DOE’s regulation of imports and exports from and to countries without an FTA is more comprehensive. The FERC also regulates the construction and operation of import and export facilities, including LNG terminals. Regulation of imports and exports and related facilities may materially affect natural gas markets and sales prices and could inhibit the development of LNG infrastructure.
Regulation of production
The production of crude oil and natural gas is regulated by a wide range of federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, which require, among other matters, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations. Each of the states where we own and operate properties have laws and regulations governing conservation, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, the plugging and abandonment of wells, the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and limitations or prohibitions on the venting or flaring of natural gas. These laws and regulations directly and indirectly limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells and locations we can drill, although we can and do apply for exceptions to such laws and regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production, severance or excise tax on the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
The failure to comply with the above laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our similarly situated competitors are generally subject to the same laws, rules, and regulations as we are.
Environmental regulation
General. We are subject to stringent, complex, and overlapping federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations governing environmental compliance, including the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may, among other things:
•require the acquisition of various permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations;
•restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transportation activities;
•limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered species of plants and animals;
•require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and
•impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations.
These laws, rules and regulations may restrict the level of substances generated by our operations that may be emitted into the air, discharged to surface water, and disposed or otherwise released to surface and below-ground soils and groundwater, and may also restrict the rate of crude oil and natural gas production to a rate that is economically infeasible for continued production. The regulatory burden on the crude oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additionally, in the name of combatting climate change, President Biden has issued, and may continue to issue, executive orders that result in more stringent and costly requirements for the domestic crude oil and natural gas industry, or which restrict, delay or ban oil and gas permitting or leasing on federal lands. Any regulatory or executive changes that impose further requirements on domestic producers for emissions control, waste handling, disposal, cleanup and remediation could have a significant impact on our operating costs and production of oil and gas. Failure to comply with these and other laws, rules and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations, and potential litigation in a particular area. Additionally, certain of these environmental laws may result in imposition of joint and several or strict liability, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. For instance, an accidental release from one of our wells could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners or other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Certain environmental laws also provide for certain citizen suits, which allow persons or organizations to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental laws. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The following is a description of some of the environmental laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, that apply to our operations.
Air emissions. Federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations have been and, in the future, will likely be enacted to address concerns about emissions of regulated air pollutants. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit standards or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. For example, in October 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) announced its intention to initiate a rule-making to reassess and lower, by the end of 2023, the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone, which was last set by the EPA under the Obama Administration in 2015. State implementation of a revised NAAQS for ground-level ozone could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, or result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries and, as a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases as well as to reduce, restrict, or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of the oil and gas industry in general are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases.
Federal regulatory initiatives have focused on establishing construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources, requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and reducing methane emissions from oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions. During 2020, the Trump Administration revised performance standards for methane established in 2016 to lessen the impact of those standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, shortly after taking office in 2021, President Biden issued an executive order calling on the EPA to revisit federal regulations regarding methane and establish new or more stringent standards for existing or new sources in the oil and gas sector, including the transmission and storage segments. The U.S. Congress also passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the 2020 rulemaking, effectively reinstating the 2016 standards. In response to President Biden’s executive order, in November 2021 the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would establish Quad Ob new source and Quad Oc first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the crude oil and natural gas source category. This proposed rule would apply to upstream and midstream facilities at oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements, operation and maintenance requirements, and so-called green well completion requirements. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal enhancing this proposed rulemaking in 2022 that will contain additional requirements that were not included in the November 2021 proposed rule. The EPA anticipates issuing a final rule before end-of-year 2022. Additionally, the House of Representatives version of the Build Back Better Act included a fee on methane emissions, targeting industries that produce, transport, and store natural gas throughout the United States at $900 per ton in 2023, $1,200 per ton in 2024, and $1,500 per ton in 2025 and beyond. Congress could seek to include this or a similar fee in future legislation.
Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” which is a non-binding agreement among participating nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50%-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. Moreover, in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”), multiple announcements (not having the effect of law) were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain measures perceived to subsidize fossil fuel production and consumption, and to pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 counties joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. The impacts of these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States’ commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time.
Governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from greenhouse gas emissions has given rise to increasing federal political risk for the domestic crude oil and natural gas industry. In the United States, President Biden has issued several executive orders calling for more expansive action to address climate change and suspend new oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters. The suspension of the federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana in June 2021, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. The federal government is appealing the district court decision. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other parties have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages, or that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose those impacts.
Moreover, our access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Stockholders and bondholders currently invested in energy companies but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to energy companies have also focused on sustainability lending practices that favor alternative power sources perceived to be more clean (despite their negative impacts on the environment), such as wind and solar. Some of these investors may elect not to provide traditional funding for energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those 
emissions. At COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (“GFANZ”) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting or eliminating access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. More recently, in November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. While we cannot predict what policies may result from this, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for acquisition, exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could impact our business and operations. To the extent the rules impose additional reporting obligations, we could face increased costs. Furthermore, the SEC has announced it will propose rules that, among other matters, will establish a framework for the reporting of climate risks. However, no such rules have been proposed to date and we cannot predict what any such rules may require. To the extent rules impose additional reporting obligations, we could face increased costs. Separately, the SEC has also announced it is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC was to allege that an issuer’s existing climate disclosures were misleading or deficient. 
Environmental protection and natural gas flaring. One of our environmental initiatives is the reduction of air emissions produced from our operations, including the flaring of natural gas from our operated well sites in the Bakken field of North Dakota. North Dakota law permits flaring of natural gas from a well that has not been connected to a gas gathering line for a period of one year from the date of a well’s first production. After one year, a producer is required to cap the well, connect it to a gas gathering line, find acceptable alternative uses for a percentage of the flared gas, or apply to the North Dakota Industrial Commission ("NDIC") for a written exemption for any future flaring; otherwise, the producer is required to pay royalties and production taxes based on the volume and value of the gas flared from the unconnected well. 
In addition, NDIC rules for new drilling permit applications also require the submission of gas capture plans setting forth plans taken by operators to capture and not flare produced gas, regardless of whether it has been or will be connected within the first year of production. The NDIC currently requires us to capture 91% of the natural gas produced from a field. We capture in excess of the NDIC requirement. If an operator is unable to attain the applicable gas capture percentage goal at maximum efficient rate, wells will be restricted in production to 200 barrels of crude oil per day if at least 60% of the monthly volume of associated natural gas produced from the well is captured, or otherwise crude oil production from such wells is not permitted to exceed 100 barrels of crude oil per day. However, the NDIC will consider temporary exemptions from the foregoing restrictions or for other types of extenuating circumstances after notice and hearing if the effect is a significant net increase in gas capture within one year of the date such relief is granted. Monetary penalty provisions also apply under this regulation if an operator fails to timely file for a hearing with the NDIC upon being unable to meet such percentage goals or if the operator fails to timely implement production restrictions once below the applicable percentage goals. Ongoing compliance with the NDIC’s flaring requirements or the imposition of any additional limitations on flaring could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our operations.
We seek to reduce or eliminate natural gas flaring, but our efforts may not always be successful or cost-effective. Our levels of flaring are impacted by external factors such as investment from third parties in the development and continued operation of gas gathering and processing facilities and the granting of reasonable right-of-way access by land owners. Increased emissions from our facilities due to flaring could subject our facilities to more stringent air emission permitting requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs and potential construction delays.
Hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppant and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate crude oil and natural gas production. In recent years there has been public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies or to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state agencies have studied the environmental risks with respect to hydraulic fracturing, and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would potentially increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. 
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance related to such activities. Also, the EPA has issued a final regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. We do not 
discharge wastewater to publicly owned treatment works, so the impact of this regulation on us is not currently, and is not expected to be, material. 
In late 2016 the EPA published a final study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources in which the EPA indicated it found evidence that such activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances. In its final report, the EPA indicated it was not able to calculate or estimate the national frequency of impacts on drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing activities or fully characterize the severity of impacts. Nonetheless, the results of the EPA’s study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. 
In 2016, the BLM under the Obama Administration published final rules related to the regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. However, the BLM under the Trump Administration published a final rule rescinding the 2016 final rule in November 2018. Litigation challenging the BLM's 2016 final rule as well as its 2018 final rule rescinding the 2016 rule has been pursued by various states and industry and environmental groups. While a California federal court vacated the 2018 final rule in July 2020, a Wyoming federal court subsequently vacated the 2016 final rule in October 2020 and, accordingly, the 2016 final rule is no longer in effect. However, appeals to those decisions are ongoing. Notwithstanding these recent legal developments, further administrative and regulatory restrictions may be adopted by the Biden Administration that could restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands and waters. 
In addition, regulators in states in which we operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (the “OCC”) has promulgated guidance for operators of crude oil and natural gas wells in certain seismically-active areas of the SCOOP and STACK plays in Oklahoma. The OCC's guidance provides for seismic monitoring and for implementation of mitigation procedures, which may include curtailment or even suspension of operations in the event of concurrent seismic events within a particular radius of operations of a magnitude exceeding 2.5 on the Richter scale. If seismic events exceeding the OCC guidance thresholds were to occur near our active stimulation operations on a frequent basis, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Waste water disposal. Underground injection wells are a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. In response to seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have investigated whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity. To address concerns regarding seismicity, some states, including states in which we operate, have pursued remedies that included delaying permit approvals, mandating a reduction in injection volumes, or shutting down or imposing moratoria on the use of injection wells. Moreover, regulators in states in which we operate have implemented additional requirements related to seismicity. For example, the OCC has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas in the Arbuckle formation of Oklahoma. These rules require, among other things, that disposal well operators conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ respective depths that, depending on the depth, could require plugging the well and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. Oklahoma utilizes a “traffic light” system wherein the OCC reviews new or existing disposal wells for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. At the federal level, the EPA’s current regulatory requirements for such wells do not require the consideration of seismic impacts when issuing permits. We cannot predict the EPA’s future actions in this regard. 
The introduction of new environmental laws and regulations related to the disposal of wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize underground injection wells. A lack of waste water disposal sites could cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans. Additionally, increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. These costs are commonly incurred by oil and gas producers and we do not expect the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In recent years, we have increased our operation and use of water recycling and distribution facilities that economically reuse stimulation water for both operational efficiencies and environmental benefits.
We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Employee Health and Safety. We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulation under Title III of the federal superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state laws and regulations require information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
Human Capital
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,254 people, all of which were employed in the United States, with 721 employees being located at our corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and 533 employees located in our field offices located in Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Texas. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We believe our overall relations with our workforce are good.
Compensation
Because we operate in a highly competitive environment, we have designed our compensation program to attract, retain and motivate experienced, talented individuals.  Our program is also designed to align employee’s interests with those of our shareholders and to reward them for achieving the business and strategic objectives determined to be important to help the Company create and maintain advantage in a competitive environment.  We align our employee’s interests with those of our shareholders by making annual restricted stock awards to virtually all of our employees.  We reward our employees for their performance in helping the Company achieve its annual business and strategic objectives through our bonus program, which is also available to virtually all of our employees.  In order to ensure our compensation package remains competitive and fulfills our goal of recruiting and retaining talented employees, we consider competitive market compensation paid by other companies comparable to the Company in size, geographic location, and operations.
Safety
Safety is our highest priority and one of our core values. We promote safety with a robust health and safety program that includes employee orientation and training, contractor management, risk assessments, hazard identification and mitigation, audits, incident reporting and investigation, and corrective/preventative action development.   
Through our “Brother’s Keeper” program, we encourage each of our employees to be a proactive participant in ensuring the safety of all of the Company’s personnel.  We developed this program to leverage and continuously improve our ability to identify and prevent reoccurrence of unsafe behaviors and conditions.  This program recognizes and rewards Company employees and contractors who observe and report outstanding safety and environmental behavior such as utilizing stop work authority, looking out for a co-worker, reporting incidents and near misses, or following proper safety procedures. This program positively impacts safety culture and performance and has contributed to a substantial increase in our reporting rates and to decreases in recordable incident and lost time incident rates. Our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), a commonly used safety metric that measures the number of recordable incidents per 100 full-time employees and contractors during a one year period, has decreased sequentially in each of the past four years and measured 0.33 for 2021, a 61% decrease compared to 2017.
Training and Development
We are committed to the training and development of our employees.  We believe that supporting our employees in achieving their career and development goals is a key element of our approach to attracting and retaining top talent.  We have invested in a variety of resources to support employees in achieving their career and development goals, including developing learning paths for individual contributors and leaders, operating the Continental Leadership Learning Center which offers numerous instructor-led programs designed to foster employee development and maintaining a learning management system which provides access to numerous technical and soft skills online courses.  We also invest time and resources in supporting the creation of individual development plans for our employees. 
Health and Wellness
We offer various benefit programs designed to promote the health and well-being of our employees and their families. These benefits include medical, dental, and vision insurance plans; disability and life insurance plans; paid time off for holidays, vacation, sick leave, and other personal leave; and healthcare flexible spending accounts, among other things. In addition to these programs, we have a number of other programs designed to further promote the health and wellness of our employees. For 
instance, employees at our corporate headquarters have access to our fitness center. Additionally, we have an employee assistance program that offers counseling and referral services for a broad range of personal and family situations. We also offer a wellness plan that includes annual biometric screenings, flu shots, smoking cessation programs, and healthy snack options in our break rooms to encourage total body wellness.
From the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic we have taken, and continue to take, proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, both at work and at home. These measures have included offering free in-office testing, providing flexible work schedules for impacted employees, holding in-office vaccination clinics so that interested employees and household members could conveniently receive vaccinations as soon as possible, maintaining physical distancing policies, limiting the number of employees attending meetings, reducing the number of people at our sites, requiring the use of masks in certain circumstances, frequently and extensively disinfecting common areas, and implementing self-isolation and quarantine requirements, among other things. We are committed to maintaining best practices with our COVID-19 response protocols and will continue to work under the guidance of public health officials to ensure a safe workplace as long as COVID-19 remains a threat to our employees and communities. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive workplace and career development opportunities to attract and retain talented employees. We prohibit discrimination and harassment of any type and afford equal employment opportunities to employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other basis protected by local, state, or federal law. We also maintain a robust compliance program rooted in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which provides policies and guidance on non-discrimination, anti-harassment, and equal employment opportunities. 
We believe embracing diversity and inclusion is more than a matter of compliance. We recognize and appreciate the importance of creating an environment in which all employees feel valued, included, and empowered to do their best work and bring great ideas to the table. We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce provides the best opportunity to obtain unique perspectives, experiences, ideas, and solutions to help sustain our business success; a diverse and inclusive culture is the high-performance fuel that enhances our ability to innovate, execute and grow. To that end, we have begun implementing a long-term initiative for enhancing awareness of, and continuously improving our approach to, building and sustaining a diverse and inclusive culture. We have chartered a Diversity and Inclusion Committee comprised of employees across all company functions. We have engaged external training resources for our entire workforce, including interview training for hiring managers focused on ensuring a fair and systematic approach for recruiting and selecting individuals from diverse backgrounds for competitive job openings. We are intentional about proactively conducting outreach and recruitment at job fairs and other events hosted by diverse organizations. We are working with our newly formed Diversity and Inclusion Committee to provide new opportunities for our leadership and all employees to hold targeted discussions on issues related to diversity and inclusion, such as unconscious bias, disability inclusion, and equality through inclusive interaction. We are committed to continuous improvement in this critical area, evaluating more ways to sustain and strengthen our diverse and inclusive workforce.
