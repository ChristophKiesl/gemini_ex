Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Mohawk Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Mohawk”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), is a rapidly growing technology-enabled consumer products platform (“CPG”) that uses machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics to design, develop, market and sell products.  Mohawk was founded on the premise that if a company selling consumer packaged goods was founded today, it would apply artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning, the synthesis of massive quantities of data and the use of social proof to validate high caliber product offerings as opposed to over-reliance on brand value and other traditional marketing tactics. Today, we predominantly operate through online retail channels such as Amazon and Walmart.
 We have launched and sold hundreds of SKUs on e-commerce platforms. Through the success of a number of those products we have incubated our own brands. We also have recently started to acquire brands and products in product categories when we believe it is more advantageous than developing our own brands and products. Today, we own and operate eleven brands that sell products in multiple categories, including home and kitchen appliances, heating, cooling and air quality, health and beauty, cookware, kitchen tools and gadgets and personal protective equipment. 
 Our eleven brands include, hOmeLabs; Vremi, Xtava; RIF6; Aussie Health; Holonix; Truweo; Mueller; Pursteam; Pohl and Schmitt; and Spiralizer. On February 2, 2021, we acquired the assets of Healing Solutions, LLC, an online seller of essential oils.

 We believe we are reinventing how to rapidly and successfully identify new product and market opportunities, and to launch, autonomously market and sell products in the rapidly growing global e-commerce market by leveraging our proprietary software technology platform, known as AIMEE. AIMEE combines large quantities of data, AI, machine learning and other automation algorithms, at scale, to allow rapid opportunity identification and automated online sales and marketing of consumer products.
 AIMEE sources data from various e-commerce platforms, the internet and publicly available data, allowing us to estimate and determine trends, performance and consumer sentiment on products and searches within e-commerce platforms. This functionality allows us to help determine which products to market, manufacture through contract manufacturers, import and sell on e-commerce marketplaces. AIMEE is also connected, through application program interfaces (“APIs”), to multiple e-commerce platforms. This allows us to automate the purchase of marketing, automate various parts of our fulfillment and logistics operations and to automate pricing changes on product listings. We generate revenue primarily through the online sales of our various digital native consumer products and substantially all of our sales are made through the Amazon U.S. marketplace.

 Our History and Corporate Information 
 We were incorporated in Delaware under the name Mohawk Group Holdings, Inc. in March 2018. We have a single direct operating subsidiary, Mohawk Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was incorporated in Delaware in April 2014. As of December 31, 2020, we have multiple operating subsidiaries located in the United States, Canada, Ireland and China and conduct various aspects of our business in a number of other geographic locations including Philippines, Israel, Poland, France and Ukraine. 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 37 East 18th Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10003, and our telephone number is (347) 676-1681. Our website address is www.mohawkgp.com. We do not incorporate the information on, or accessible through, our website into this Annual Report, and you should not consider any information on, or accessible through, our website as part of this Annual Report. We have included our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K solely as an inactive textual reference. 
Our Platform 
 AIMEE, our proprietary technology platform, allows us to identify product and market opportunities and to execute and manage online marketing strategies. In addition, AIMEE’s innovative data analytics platform provides real-time inventory visibility allowing us to automate and manage the life-cycle of our consumer product portfolio. 
 Using data and analysis provided by AIMEE, we determine which products to market, manufacture through contract manufacturers, import and sell on e-commerce marketplaces. We contract manufacturers, through purchase orders, predominately in China, to manufacture our consumer products. We have employees in China that perform sourcing, product testing, manufacturer qualification, quality assurance and control and purchasing, among other things. We take ownership and import these goods from China through various transportation methods via third-party transporters. We use a combination of Amazon warehouses, other third-party warehouses and logistics partners to fulfill direct-to-consumer orders through agreements or terms of services. Our scalable fulfillment services are integrated with AIMEE and are Amazon Prime Certified. We believe we can deliver products within two days of order through ground shipment across 99% of the U.S. market. Further, we have expanded our third-party warehouse network to add fulfillment by merchant (“FBM”) One Day Prime delivery for sales through Amazon, for approximately 76% of the U.S., based on our sales history. We believe that the increase in warehouse costs associated with this expansion will be more than offset by the decrease in shipping costs to customers, as the average last mile shipping zones will decrease due to our increased reach. Our sales, marketing and fulfillment are substantially integrated into AIMEE, which allows us to automate price, media buying, search engine optimization and shipping. 
 AIMEE is being developed to be product agnostic and we believe it can help us identify opportunities in most product categories and its other lifecycle capabilities can be applied to most consumer products. To date, we have primarily focused more on products that require limited research and development, where small but meaningful data-driven adjustments to the product can be leveraged to address customer needs. We make initial marketing investments in our products at launch to capture highly visible virtual shelf space. We believe that our marketing strategies, when combined with social proof for our products, can create longer term revenue streams for our business that will require limited human touch as AIMEE’s functionality continues to be developed to autonomously optimize certain proprietary online marketing strategies for the product. Our large and growing data set provides the foundation for proprietary algorithms that AIMEE is being developed to execute throughout our business, including algorithms that predict purchase behavior, forecast demand and optimize inventory. We believe that in the long term, technology will play a key factor in creating and sustaining our advantage in the mass market CPG industry. With the commoditization of product manufacturing and brand advertising, efficiency of supply chain through technology will be a significant differentiator. CPG companies that can harness large amounts of data and apply analytics, automation and machine learning to better understand consumer needs, automate marketing processes and reduce fixed costs will prevail.
 AIMEE’s functionality is comprised of three modules that are in various stages of development and that operate today in combination with human judgment and oversight: 
 Market Research. AIMEE’s idea generator functionality quickly analyzes and filters millions of shopping-related data points to identify product opportunities, including relevant product specifications, based on consumer sentiment, product trends and attributes and competitive landscape analysis, among other things. 
 Financial Planning & Analysis. AIMEE’s financial planning and analysis functionality is being developed to perform product cash flow projections at the individual product level to provide visibility into the product pipeline and to compare projections against real-time results.

Automated Marketing Strategy Execution. AIMEE’s algorithms select and execute online marketplace trading strategies to optimize product sales and contribution margin. These algorithms run at intervals of approximately twenty minutes to two hours to assist in evalutating price, media buying, product listing health, SEO and inventory levels. AIMEE’s architecture continues to be developed to learn new skills and to execute complex tactics and strategies.
 We continue to develop AIMEE’s capabilities, including with respect to forecasting, inventory management, online marketing and other aspects, which today involve human judgment and oversight. We believe that AIMEE can be applied to other non-competing products and have launched pilot programs for our PaaS (“Platform as a Service”) business with third-party brands. 

Our Business Model 
 We believe the digital disruption of retail, namely the consumer shift to e-commerce, will continue for decades to come. As this digital disruption continues, we believe the products consumers purchase, and the places they purchase them, will index more towards function, value, and ease / speed of delivery and less towards the historical dominance of brand recognition.  The ubiquity of data on the internet has empowered consumers to make data driven choices when it comes to nearly every consumer choice.  In this data rich world, we believe that digital marketplaces offer both brands and consumers the best value when it comes to buying and selling consumer products.
 For the consumer, digital marketplaces offer nearly endless product choice, competitive pricing and easy delivery options.  For brands and manufacturers, digital marketplaces not only offer the ability to instantly connect with millions of customers across the world, but also provide a real-time data stream of purchase behavior to decide against.  The data that digital marketplaces provide, in addition to consumer trends data that exists outside of these marketplaces, creates an opportunity for software to change the way products are ideated, merchandised, marketed, analyzed and fulfilled.
 AIMEE, our software platform, infuses technology throughout the entire consumer product value chain, allowing us to create and sell products and brands with superior value propositions versus the legacy incumbents products. 
 We believe our platform makes it possible for us to launch and automates the sales of evergreen products with features that customers have indicated are the most important to them and with profitable unit economics. With scale, we gain purchasing power both at the product level and at the overall fulfillment level, which improves our operating results. We also believe that our platform provides us with substantial leverage such that we can acquire already existing products and utilize AIMEE to optimize “make” versus “buy” decisions.
 Core to our identity is the continuous automation and optimization of every aspect of our business through technology so that our overhead remains modest in relation to the number of products on our platform.  In short, we desire to become the most efficient and scalable consumer product company in the world. Our AIMEE platform gives us the ability to track unit economics on an individual SKU basis, which we believe, combined with the automation of our fixed costs, will allow us to disrupt and scale the business model of CPG. 
 Our product lifecycle can be summarized as follows: 
  
1. | We use AIMEE to analyze shopping-related data points, assist in performing product cash flow projections at the product level and to detect product opportunities in e-commerce markets on which we sell, primarily the US Amazon marketplace.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | We contract manufacture products under our owned and operated brands based on the data analyzed by AIMEE and aim to commercially launch such products roughly within six to eight months after an idea has been identified.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. | Each of our products then typically goes through the Launch phase and depending on its level of success is moved to one of the other phases as further described below:
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | Launch phase: During this phase, we leverage our technology to target opportunities identified using AIMEE. During this period of time, and due to the combination of discounts and investment in marketing, our net margin for a product could be as low as approximately negative 35%. Net margin is calculated by taking net revenue less cost of goods sold, less fulfillment, online advertising and selling expenses. These costs primarily reflect the estimated variable costs related to the sale of a product.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | Sustain phase: Our goal is for every product we launch is to enter the sustain phase and become profitable, with a target average of positive 15% net margin and within three months of launch on average. Net margin reflects a combination of manual and automated adjustments in price and marketing spend. Over time, our products benefit from economies of scale stemming from purchasing power both with manufacturers and with fulfillment providers.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | Milk phase or Liquidate phase: If a product does not enter the sustain phase or if the customer satisfaction of the product (i.e., ratings) is not satisfactory, then it will go to the liquidate phase and we will sell the remaining inventory. In order to enter the milk phase, we believe that a product must be well received and become a strong leader in its category in both customer satisfaction and volume sold as compared to its competition. Products in the milk phase that have achieved profitability should benefit from pricing power and we expect their profitability to increase accordingly. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, none of our products have achieved the milk phase and we can provide no assurance that any of our products will do so in the future.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To date, our operating results have included a mix of products in the launch and sustain phases, and we expect such results to include a mix of products in all phases at any given period. Product mix can affect our gross profit and the variable portion of our sales and distribution expenses. Ultimately, we believe that the future cash flow generated by our products in the sustain phase will outpace the amount that we will reinvest into launching new products, driving profitability at the company level while we continue to invest in growth and technology. 
 Time to Market Advantage vs Incumbents 
 

Market Opportunity & Industry 
 The e-Commerce Industry is Experiencing Massive Growth and Technology is Driving Transformation Across Consumer Product Industries and Marketplaces 
 According to eMarketer’s December 2020 publication the global e-commerce market is forecasted to grow to approximately $6.4 trillion by the year 2024, up from $3.4 trillion in 2019, and increase as a percentage of overall retail sales from 13.6% to 21.8% during the same time period.  Digital marketplaces specifically have been, and we believe will continue to be, integral in fueling this shift to e-commerce, with nearly one-third of all e-commerce purchases coming from Amazon alone according to a recent DigitalCommerce360 report. 
 This shift in consumer behavior has enabled technological innovation that has profoundly impacted how consumers discover and purchase products. Consumer product companies must in turn adapt their businesses in order to engage effectively with this new crop 
 5


of digital-first customers. We believe that a brand’s ability to drive margin accretion in this digital / data-first world will be a function of a brand’s ability to use machine learning and automation to optimize a product’s cost of sales.  Paramount will be a brand’s ability to quickly synthesize massive quantities of data that can be considered to inform everything from a product’s aesthetic and functionality to its marketing strategy and inventory planning. 
 We believe that new, highly powered data driven business models that embrace these changes and deeply focus on the consumer will be the winners in this rapidly changing environment. We also believe that human beings cannot accurately and efficiently process the massive quantities of various data points required to address real-time dynamic marketplace changes. We believe that AIMEE’s ability to ingest, synthesize, and make decisions against the massive amount of data the internet and digital marketplaces in particular offer, positions us for success to address these structural shifts as consumers move to digital marketplaces to satisfy their needs. 
 Many CPG Companies Have Failed to Adapt to Changing Consumer Behavior in the e-Commerce Market
 The development of selling tools and software like Shopify and Amazon’s Seller Central have materially reduced the barrier to entry for new brands to launch and quickly connect with millions of customers across the globe.  This democratization of the consumer product space has produced headwinds for legacy CPG companies that have historically relied upon consumer brand recognition and predictable physical retail shelf space to maintain category dominance. We believe the traditional brick-and-mortar CPG industry lacks the dynamism and technological innovation needed to succeed in this new paradigm offering consumers nearly infinite choice. We believe digitally native brands will continue to take market share from these legacy incumbents by offering more competitive pricing and product features, and will supplant traditional brand awareness by instead focusing on creating direct relationships with consumers that ultimately manifest in durable social-proof moats across the largest e-commerce channels. We believe newer, more agile, data driven CPG companies, like Mohawk, have the ability to better understand what consumers are looking for in real time and to make our products visible to consumers on the right virtual shelves and at efficient costs. 
The Consumer Journey is Data-Driven and No Longer Relies Primarily on Brand Value to Drive Buying Decisions
 We believe the increase in consumer choice as it relates to brands, products and channels has lessened the importance of brand recognition and perception in dictating consumer product preferences.  Indeed, Amazon search data reflects this shift, with only 22% of Amazon product searches including a brand name, according to a 2019 Marketplace Pulse report. 
 We believe our platform addresses these changes in shopping behavior in a precise and scalable way. AIMEE has the ability to synthesize large quantities of data relating to relevant features and trends in consumer preferences, which allows us to quickly develop products that delight consumers. AIMEE also allows us to manage the other component parts of successfully scaling a consumer product on marketplaces, including merchandising, marketing, sales forecasting, and fulfillment. 
 Consumer Products - Make versus Buy
 We have used AIMEE to make (internally develop) our products portfolio of five owned and operated consumer product brands and have hundreds of SKUs available for sale. AIMEE’s idea generator has been developed to be product agnostic and we believe can generate product opportunities in most product categories. We have also leveraged AIMEE to buy (acquire through acquisition) consumer product brands and related products. During 2020, we acquired the brands Truweo, Mueller, Pursteam, Pohl and Schmitt, and Spriralizer and their related products and during 2019, we acquired the brand Aussie Health. 
  6



Acquisitions 
 While we intend to pursue growth from our existing product portfolio and from new product launches, we also intend to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions of digital native brands that have the potential to be quickly on-boarded onto our AIMEE platform. When looking at new potential product categories and potential acquisition targets, we typically apply a make-or-buy analysis based on the data provided from our AIMEE technology platform combined with our assessment of the risks and costs of successfully launching products in the new product category. We intend to pursue acquisitions when the target meets our financial and other criteria, including potential cost saving synergies, revenue sustainability and risk mitigation. Cost saving synergies are derived primarily from reduced labor costs because we expect that we will not hire many of the target company’s employees, if any. We expect that these consumer product businesses will typically have built a significant presence on at least one e-commerce marketplace around one or more product categories. We expect that the products of these businesses will have strong unit economics, high product quality and stable supply chains, have developed significant social proof in the form of customer reviews and high search ranking for relevant keywords and are in product categories where frequent product improvement is not required. They also tend to have significant concentration risk due to limited product categories, have limited ability to scale as they do not have a technology platform enabling automation and have limited working capital to further enable growth. 
 Our ability to complete any acquisition typically depends on a number of factors including the successful completion of confirmatory due diligence, negotiation of definitive agreements, the seller providing seller financing, our ability to use debt and equity financing, and permission from our existing lenders.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
 We believe that many brands have under-invested in their marketplace strategy due to the inherent complexities of managing businesses on Amazon and a fundamental misunderstanding of the accretive relationship between Amazon and other sales channels.  Moreover, we believe a number of macro-environmental factors, including the rising costs of customer acquisition on traditional digital channels, the growth of the Amazon Prime program, and the continued proliferation of third-party sellers across the largest e-commerce channels, will push many brands to more fully embrace the Amazon marketplace as a critical component of an omni-channel distribution strategy.  We believe AIMEE is uniquely equipped to add value to brands and manufacturers in this emerging paradigm, leveraging real-time analytics and sales automation to help brands more effectively manage their marketplace strategy.
 We believe that our PaaS solution, which includes combined access to our team’s expertise and the AIMEE platform, could provide a significant advantage over other competitors in this industry. We believe this is because many incumbent CPG companies have historically operated as business-to-businesses and have not invested sufficiently to succeed on online marketplaces. With a PaaS solution, we believe we can bridge this operational gap by offering our technology combined with our substantial know-how in managing business-to-consumer supply chains, marketing, and customer service, among other things.
 We continue to offer our Platform as a Service solution through pilot programs to brands and manufacturers.  Our offering provides substantially the same capabilities utilized for our owned and operated portfolio of products. We currently structure our offering as a standalone PaaS service or, in cases where the client’s third-party’s logistics do not allow for fulfillment direct-to-consumer, as a PaaS service suite which includes a standard reseller agreement that leverages our integrated direct-to-consumer fulfillment program. 
 Follow-on Equity Offering
 On August 26, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering (the “Follow-On Offering”) of 3,860,710 shares of common stock, which included the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock solely to cover over-allotments, at a public offering price of $7.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. We received net proceeds of approximately $23.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $2.2 million and other offering expenses payable by us of approximately $1.4 million. 
Debt Refinancing
 On November 30, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with High Trail Investments SA LLC (“High Trail”), pursuant to which, among other things, we issued and sold to High Trail in a private placement transaction (the “Private Placement”), in exchange for the payment by High Trail of $38.0 million, (i) a 0% coupon senior secured promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of $43.0 million (the “Note”), and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,864,133 shares of our common stock (the “Warrant”). On December 1, 2020, we closed the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off all obligations under the $15.0 million term loan (the “Horizon Term Loan”) previously provided pursuant to that certain Venture Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2018, by and among us, Mohawk Group, Inc. and our subsidiaries from time to time party thereto and Horizon Technology Finance Corporation (“Horizon”) as a lender and collateral agent, as amended (such Venture Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, the “Horizon Loan Agreement”), for $15.0 million and terminated the Horizon Term Loan.  
Intellectual Property 
 We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements (including open source software) to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We generally do not pursue patent applications as a means of protecting our intellectual property. We have applied to register or have registered certain of our trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
Customers 
 Our customers are primarily individual online consumers who purchase our products primarily on Amazon US, and to a lesser extent on our owned and operated websites and other marketplaces. In 2019, approximately 95% of our revenue was through or with the Amazon sales platform and in 2020, 88% of our revenue was through or with the Amazon sales platform. Customers in our PaaS business consist of third-party consumer product companies who are primarily engaged in pilot programs.
 8


Seasonality 
 Our individual product categories are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of the summer season for certain of our environmental appliance products and the fall and holiday season for our small kitchen appliances and accessories. With our current mix of environmental appliances, the sales of those products tend to be significantly higher in the summer season. Further, our small kitchen appliances and accessories tend to have higher sales during the fourth quarter, which includes Thanksgiving and the December holiday season. As a result, our operational results, cash flows, cash and inventory positions  may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in our product mix.
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing strategy and approach is substantially integrated into AIMEE and also involves human judgment. AIMEE is being developed to allow us to automate price, media buying, search engine optimization and a/b testing leveraging our proprietary technology software and algorithms we have built into AIMEE. We believe this automation will bring significant competitive advantages for our products and PaaS customers alike. For our SKUs, our advertising investment is focused on online channels and e-commerce platforms. Currently our primary focus on advertising spend is online across Amazon, Google and Facebook. Our spend and approach on advertising is different depending on the life cycle of products on our platform. We view and classify products into categories such as launch, sustain, milk or liquidate. 
 The launch phase is where we classify new products being introduced into the marketplace. The advertising spend during this stage is aggressive and can last for three months on average to ensure the product launch is successful, with a focus on search optimization and the development of social proof that our products are meeting customer needs. Once our products reach the sustain phase, our sales and marketing strategy then focuses on managing price and pay-per-click optimization, along with a corresponding reduction in spending on search optimization and social proof. 
 Third-Party Manufacturing & Logistics 
 As of December 31, 2020, we contract, through purchase orders, with approximately 94 manufacturers, predominately in China, for substantially all of our consumer products. As of December 31, 2020, we have an operations team of approximately 31 people in Shenzhen, China that performs sourcing, product testing, manufacturer qualification, quality assurance and control and purchasing, among other things. In general, we do not use master agreements with vendors and aim to have flexibility in our supply chain to match our forecasting needs. 
 We use a combination of Amazon warehouses, other third-party warehouse and logistics partners to fulfill direct-to-consumer orders, through agreements or terms of services. In addition to fulfillment by Amazon warehouses, in 2018 we began utilizing three geographically distributed third-party warehouses to allow us to deliver orders within two days through ground shipment to approximately 99% of the U.S. market. Warehouse selection for any particular product depends on the size and other aspects of the products to be warehoused, with a focus on optimizing storage and fulfillment costs. We are focused on driving manufacturing and logistics costs down as we grow, scale and improve our purchasing power. We have expanded our third-party warehouse network to provide FBM One Day Prime delivery. This expansion covered approximately 76% of the U.S. market in 2020, based on our sales history. We believe that the increase in warehouse costs associated with this expansion will be more than offset by the decrease in shipping costs to customers as the average last mile shipping zones will decrease due to our increased reach.
Competition 
 The consumer goods and e-commerce markets are highly competitive, including the market for potential M&A opportunities where there are many aggregators with substantial access to capital focused on acquiring Amazon third party sellers. Our competitors include traditional and non-traditional consumer good companies, discount stores, traditional retailers, the online platforms of these traditional retail competitors, independent retail stores and e-commerce companies. The market for PaaS services relating to e-commerce, and the U.S. Amazon marketplace in particular, is also very competitive with a variety of well-funded entrants in the space.  The market landscape is diverse, with competitors selling into brands, agencies, manufacturers and retailers alike. The services offered by these competitors vary, with some offering point solutions for specific aspects related to selling on Amazon, including research and business intelligence, Amazon services and listing management, while others focus on a more holistic approach.  Some of these competitors leverage proprietary software to execute their services, while others offer personnel with relevant expertise. In addition, Amazon also offers its sellers a variety of tools that are generally free. 
 We believe that our owned and operated products business and our PaaS business give us an advantage as we are able to quickly develop new algorithms and test them on our own products to ensure their efficacy before delivering them to PaaS clients. By having 
 9


our owned and operated businesses, we are able to better predict and develop features that we believe will deliver results for PaaS clients.
 With regard to our CPG business, we believe our competitors are Amazon, Helen of Troy, Newell Brands, Frigidaire, Trademark Global and any CPG company that sells products similar to ours in the e-commerce space. There has also been an increase in the number of sellers who are based in China that sell products similar to ours. For our acquisition growth strategy, we believe our include competitors are Thrasio, HeyDay, SellerX, Perch, Boosted Commerce, and Heroes, among numerous other aggregators in the U.S and in Europe. For our PaaS business, we believe our competitors are Feedvisor, CommerceIQ, Channel Advisor, Teikametrics, Jungle Scout, and Helium10. We believe that we are able to compete effectively because of our expertise, platform, data science, and other automation.
 Regulatory Matters/Governmental Regulations 
 We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and international laws, including but not limited to those governing the processing of payments, consumer protection, the privacy of consumer information and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices. We are also subject to various environmental laws, rules and regulations, such as California’s Proposition 65.
 The products sold by us are also subject to regulation by United States governmental agencies, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, United States Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Energy and similar state and international regulatory authorities, such as the California Energy Commission. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future. 
 We are also subject to regulations relating to our supply chain. For example, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act requires retail sellers that do business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. As part of our vendor qualification process, we review suppliers’ operations for compliance with applicable labor and workplace standards and other applicable laws, including laws prohibiting child labor, forced labor and unsafe working conditions. 
 Substantially all of our products are currently manufactured in China, which may result in additional costs, if international trade negotiations result in adverse tariffs on our products.
 Although we have not suffered any material restrictions from doing business in the past due to government regulations, significant impediments may arise in the future as we expand product offerings. 
 From time to time, we dispose of obsolete inventory, which is disposed of or destroyed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 People 
 The human capital objectives we focus on in managing our business include attracting, developing, and retaining key personnel. Our employees are critical to the success of our organization and the Company is committed to supporting our employees’ professional development. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth strategy and continue to drive shareholder value. We provide competitive compensation, which includes a focus on stock-based compensation, and benefits to attract and retain key personnel, while also providing a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace. We continue to develop and grow in-house learning and development for its employees which is primarily performed online on a variety of topics, including topics that advance leadership skills.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 121 employees, of which 120 were full-time, and 30 independent contractors. Of our employees and contractors, 39 are engaged in research and development, 93 are engaged in sales, marketing and operations and 19 are in general corporate and administrative positions.
 As of December 31, 2020, our employees and contractors are based in five offices, including shared workspaces, in seven countries, including 30 in research and development, sales, marketing, operations, general corporate and administration in New York, four in operations and revenue across remote roles in United States, 31 in China where we perform operations and manufacturers inspections, four in Israel where we perform certain sale operations and research and development functions, 59 in the Philippines where we perform customer service, sales and marketing and other logistics functions and 19 in Poland where we perform research and development. We also contract four consultants predominately for research and development functions in Ukraine and France. 
 Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements or labor unions.
