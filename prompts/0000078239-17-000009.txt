Company Overview
We are one of the largest apparel companies in the world, with a history going back over 135 years. We have over 30,000 associates operating in over 40 countries. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including the global designer lifestyle brands CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger, as well as Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner’s, Olga and Eagle, which are owned brands, and Speedo, Geoffrey Beene, Kenneth Cole New York, Kenneth Cole Reaction, Sean John, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Michael Kors Collection and Chaps, which are licensed, as well as various other owned, licensed and private label brands. We design and market branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products. Additionally, we license our owned brands over a broad range of products. We sell our brands at multiple price points and in multiple channels of distribution and geographies. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, price point, distribution channel or region. During 2016, our directly operated businesses in North America consisted principally of wholesale men’s dress shirts, neckwear and underwear sales under our owned and licensed brands; wholesale men’s sportswear sales under our CALVIN KLEIN, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD and ARROW brands; wholesale womenswear sales under our Tommy Hilfiger brand (through the fourth quarter of 2016, at which time the business was licensed to a third party); wholesale men’s and women’s jeanswear sales under our CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger brands; wholesale women’s intimate apparel sales under our Calvin Klein Underwear, Warner’s and Olga brands; wholesale swimwear, footwear, swim accessories and related product sales under the Speedo brand; the operation of digital commerce sites under the CALVIN KLEIN, Tommy Hilfiger and Speedo brands; and the operation of retail stores, principally in premium outlet centers, primarily under our CALVIN KLEIN, Tommy Hilfiger and certain of our heritage brands. As of the end of 2015, our Heritage 
 1

Brands retail business primarily consisted of our Van Heusen stores but, beginning in 2015, we started offering a limited selection of IZOD Golf, Warner’s and Speedo products in some of our Heritage Brands stores. A majority of our Heritage Brands stores now offer a broad selection of Van Heusen men’s and women’s apparel with limited selections of these other brands, some of which feature multiple brand names on the door signage. During 2016, our directly operated businesses outside of North America consisted principally of our wholesale and retail sales in Europe, Japan and, beginning in April 2016, China under our Tommy Hilfiger brands; our wholesale and retail sales in Europe, Asia and Latin America under our CALVIN KLEIN brands; and the operation of digital commerce sites under the CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Our licensing activities principally related to the licensing worldwide of our CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks for a broad range of lifestyle products and for specific geographic regions. 
On November 30, 2016, we formed a joint venture in Mexico in which we own a 49% economic interest (“PVH Mexico”). The joint venture was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed our Calvin Klein business in Mexico with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I. de C.V. that distributes certain Tommy Hilfiger brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Mexico deconsolidation”).
On April 13, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the 55% of the ownership interests in TH Asia, Ltd. (“TH China”), our former joint venture for Tommy Hilfiger in China, that we did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”). As a result of the TH China acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger business in this high-growth market. 
On February 1, 2016, we entered into a licensing agreement with G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (“G-III”) for the design, production and wholesale distribution of Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the United States and Canada (the “G-III license”), which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated Tommy Hilfiger North America womenswear wholesale business in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
We exited our Izod retail business in the third quarter of 2015. 
Our history of acquisitions has made us a more diversified global organization, with an extensive brand portfolio, retail footprint and distribution network, and a large consumer base. Our acquisition of Warnaco in 2013 provided us with direct control of Calvin Klein’s two largest apparel categories, jeanswear and underwear, and followed our transformative acquisitions of Tommy Hilfiger in 2010 and Calvin Klein in 2003. We will continue to explore strategic acquisitions of licensed businesses, trademarks and companies that we believe are additive to our overall business.
We aggregate our segments into three main businesses: (i) Calvin Klein, which consists of the Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments; (ii) Tommy Hilfiger, which consists of the Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments; and (iii) Heritage Brands, which consists of the Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments. Note 19, “Segment Data,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report contains information with respect to revenue, income before interest and taxes and assets related to each segment, as well as information regarding our revenue generated from foreign and domestic sources, and the geographic locations where our net property, plant and equipment is held.
Our 2016 revenue was $8.2 billion, of which approximately 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global designer lifestyle brands, CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger, together generated over 80% of our revenue during 2016.

The global 360° marketing campaigns, which are designed to engage consumers through provocative, modern, sensual and iconic lifestyle imagery, are integral to CALVIN KLEIN. Our efforts in this area were recognized in 2016, with CALVIN KLEIN receiving the Fashion Media Awards Ad Campaign of the Year award.

Given the various price points at which products under the various CALVIN KLEIN brands are sold, we have a range of wholesale customers.

The Tommy Hilfiger brands offer a breadth of collections, including tailored clothing, sportswear, denim, accessories, underwear and footwear, and consist of:

Through our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, we sell Tommy Hilfiger products in a variety of distribution channels, including:

• | Wholesale — The Tommy Hilfiger wholesale business consists of the distribution and sale of products in North America, Europe and China under the Tommy Hilfiger brands to third party retailers and distributors (in stores and online), franchisees and pure play digital commerce retailers. Tommy Hilfiger has, since 2008, made the majority of its North American wholesale sales to Macy’s, Inc. (“Macy’s”), which is currently the exclusive department store retailer for Tommy Hilfiger men’s sportswear in the United States. During 2016, we entered into the G-III license, which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated Tommy Hilfiger North America womenswear wholesale business in the fourth quarter of 2016. Tommy Hilfiger also has a wholesale business in Canada selling men’s sportswear and dress furnishings, as well as accessories, to Hudson’s Bay Company, Canada’s leading department store.


• | Retail — The Tommy Hilfiger retail business principally consists of the distribution and sale of Tommy Hilfiger products in North America, Europe, Japan, and China through Company-operated full-price specialty and outlet stores, as well as through Company-operated digital commerce sites.

Outlet stores in North America are primarily located in premium outlet centers and carry specially designed merchandise that is sold at a lower price point than merchandise sold in our specialty stores. Outlet stores operated by Tommy Hilfiger outside of North America are used primarily to clear excess inventory from previous seasons at discounted prices and, to a lesser extent, carry specially designed merchandise.


• | Licensing — We license the Tommy Hilfiger brands to third parties both for specific product categories and in certain geographic regions, and generally on an exclusive basis. Tommy Hilfiger has over 25 license agreements.

• | Enhancing CALVIN KLEIN’s global brand relevance and premium designer status worldwide through marketing campaigns and consumer engagement initiatives designed to drive growth and further resonate with more youth-minded consumers.


• | Driving product improvement and expansion, particularly within apparel, accessories and women’s intimates.


▪ | Apparel — In Europe, our CALVIN KLEIN apparel assortments are underpenetrated compared to our Tommy Hilfiger offerings. We believe that we can grow our European apparel sales, given CALVIN KLEIN’s strong brand positioning and our proven success with Tommy Hilfiger in Europe.

 9


▪ | Accessories — We see opportunity to grow our handbag, small leather goods and accessories offerings across our geographies with the largest opportunities existing in Asia and Europe, as Calvin Klein Accessories has a very limited penetration in those markets.


▪ | Women’s Intimates — We believe that we can further expand and improve the performance of our women’s intimates assortments, particularly as we leverage our strong positioning and brand awareness in men’s underwear. To that end, we have been focused on improving our designs, detailing and quality. Fit has been another key focus area, as we are adding extended women’s sizing and tailoring products and fit to accommodate different regional markets. Additionally, our growth in logo product (including the Modern Cotton collection) is helping us engage with youth-minded shoppers, which has been additive to the existing Calvin Klein Underwear women’s customer base.


• | Pursuing growth channels, including digital commerce, specialty stores and travel retail, while opportunistically opening specialized brick and mortar locations.


• | Gaining greater control of the brand, as we continue to evolve from licensor to owner.


• | Evolving our supply chain, including through our speed to market initiatives, to drive efficiencies and other benefits.

Tommy Hilfiger Business
We believe significant growth opportunities exist to drive further global retail sales of Tommy Hilfiger, including through:

• | Enhancing global brand relevance, with marketing campaigns and consumer engagement initiatives designed to drive growth and reflect Tommy Hilfiger’s accessible luxury positioning and classic American cool aesthetic.


• | Category expansion, particularly within womenswear and accessories, men’s tailored clothing, and underwear.


▪ | Womenswear and accessories —We believe that we can grow our womenswear assortments, including accessories, globally as the Tommy Hilfiger brand remains underpenerated in this category. We see the biggest opportunity in Asia, where the brand is significantly underpenetrated compared to our European or North American businesses. Throughout 2016, we undertook several efforts to raise awareness of and to support this business, including launching the global ambassadorship with Gigi Hadid and entering into the G-III license to drive the North American womenswear wholesale business.


▪ | Men’s tailored clothing — We believe that we can grow this business as we leverage our core competencies in dress furnishings and tailored apparel and expand internationally. In January 2017, we announced that the license for the Tommy Hilfiger men’s tailored clothing business in North America with Marcraft Clothes, Inc. will be terminated effective December 31, 2017. Beginning January 1, 2018, the license will move to Peerless Clothing International, Inc. in order to consolidate our men’s tailored clothing businesses for all of our brands in North America under one partner and drive the business forward.


▪ | Underwear — We see significant room to grow the Tommy Hilfiger underwear business, as we leverage our Calvin Klein Underwear expertise with regards to fit, styling, sourcing and fabrics.


• | Continuing regional expansion, particularly in Asia, as reflected by the TH China acquisition.


• | Pursuing growth through digital commerce.


• | Evolving our supply chain, including through our speed to market initiatives, to drive efficiencies and other benefits.

Heritage Brands Business
Our Heritage Brands business is our original business, is where we developed our core competencies and is an important complement to our global designer brand businesses. We believe that this business can continue to capture market share and generate healthy cash flows as we execute against our key strategic initiatives, including:

• | Brand management, as we are committed to designing and marketing quality, trend-right products that offer great value to our customers.


• | Leveraging and enhancing each division’s positioning in the market. This includes:

 10


▪ | Dress Furnishings — We operate the world’s largest dress shirt and neckwear business. We are focused on maintaining and expanding our positioning as we introduce innovation, such as the Van Heusen Flex Collar, and expand across channels. 


▪ | Sportswear — We are focused on elevating our sportswear offerings through quality, detailing, fashion and innovation, while also expanding our distribution across our wholesale partners, with an emphasis on driving our digital sales penetration. We are focused on strengthening our position in the mid-tier department stores, reinforcing the value equation for each brand and growing through cross-channel expansion.


▪ | Core Intimates — We see a healthy path of growth for Warner’s and believe that we can expand our distribution, particularly within the mass market channel. We have enhanced our existing assortments, particularly bras, with new technologies, solutions-based innovation and more comfortable products, along with investing in new marketing campaigns and enhanced fixtures across our wholesale presentations.


▪ | Swimwear — We plan to continue to extend our product offerings of swimwear and swim products to a wider audience. Speedo is on the cutting edge of technology and innovation in the competitive swimwear arena and we are continually enhancing the product assortment to reflect the latest advancements. We see potential to broaden the brand’s customer base and relevance beyond the competitive swimmer population to reach more general fitness and recreational consumers. 


• | Maximizing distribution, particularly through wholesale partners (in store and online) and pure play digital commerce retailers.


• | Enhancing profitability by capitalizing on supply chain opportunities and maintaining a critical focus on inventory management.

 Other Strategic Opportunities 
While we believe we have an attractive and diverse portfolio of brands with growth potential, we will continue to explore acquisitions of companies or trademarks and licensing opportunities that we believe are additive to our overall business. New license opportunities allow us to fill new product and brand portfolio needs. We take a disciplined approach to acquisitions, seeking brands with broad consumer recognition that we can grow profitably and expand by leveraging our infrastructure and core competencies and, where appropriate, by extending the brand through licensing. 
Seasonality
Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue.
Design
Our businesses depend on our ability to stimulate and respond to consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality and delivering a compelling price value proposition.
A significant factor in the continued strength of our brands is our in-house design teams. We form separate teams of designers and merchandisers for each of our brands, creating a structure that focuses on the special qualities and identity of each brand. These designers and merchandisers consider consumer taste and lifestyle and trends when creating a brand or product plan for a particular season. Additionally, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger tailor products and fit for different regional markets in order to appeal to local tastes, sizing differences or other preferences, while maintaining the cohesive creative vision for each brand. The process from initial design to finished product varies greatly but generally spans six to ten months prior to each retail selling season. Our product lines are developed primarily for two major selling seasons, Spring and Fall. However, certain of our product lines offer more frequent introductions of new merchandise.
Calvin Klein implemented a new global creative strategy to unify all of the CALVIN KLEIN brands under one creative vision during 2016. As part of this strategy, Raf Simons was appointed as Chief Creative Officer of Calvin Klein and is 
 11

responsible for leading the creative strategy of the brand globally, as well as overseeing all aspects of design, global marketing and communications, and visual creative services. Mr. Simons’ first collections for CALVIN KLEIN 205 W39 NYC were presented in February 2017 at New York Fashion week and will be available for sale in Fall 2017. He also introduced Calvin Klein By Appointment, a bespoke collection of distinct looks handcrafted and made to measure in New York, New York, available exclusively by appointment. Mr. Simons’ team also controls design operations and product development for most licensees and other strategic partners. 
Tommy Hilfiger seeks to reinforce the premium positioning of the Tommy Hilfiger brands by taking a coordinated and consistent worldwide approach to brand management. We believe that regional execution and adaptation helps us anticipate, identify and respond more readily to changing consumer demand, fashion trends and local tastes or preferences. It also reduces the importance of any one collection and enables the brand to appeal to a wider range of customers.
Product Sourcing
Our capabilities for worldwide procurement and sourcing enable us to deliver to our customers competitive, high quality and low cost goods on a timely basis. We have an extensive established network of worldwide sourcing partners that enables us to meet our customers’ needs in an efficient manner and not rely on any one vendor or factory or on vendors or factories in any one country. Our products were produced in over 1,600 factories in over 50 countries during 2016. All but one of these factories was operated by independent manufacturers, with most being located in Asia. The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety, environmental and cost requirements. We source finished products and, to a lesser extent, raw materials and trim. Raw materials and trim include fabric, buttons, thread, labels and similar components. Raw materials, trim, and production commitments are generally made two to six months prior to production, and quantities are finalized at that time. We believe we are one of the largest users of shirting fabric in the world. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers and our stores. We believe that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should we need to secure additional or replacement production capacity and raw materials.

Our global supply chain teams, offices and buying agents enable us to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery performance of, our suppliers, and work with our global compliance teams to ensure the enforcement of our human rights and labor standards and other code of conduct requirements through our ongoing extensive training, approval and monitoring system. Our purchases from our suppliers are effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price, quantity, delivery date and destination of the items to be produced. Sales are monitored regularly at both the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can be made either to increase or reduce inventories. We look to establish long-term supplier relationships in the appropriate locations throughout the world to meet our needs and we place our orders in a manner designed to limit the risk that a production disruption at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem, while maximizing the business opportunity.
During the second quarter of 2016, we formed a joint venture, PVH Arvind Manufacturing Private Limited Company (“PVH Ethiopia”), in Ethiopia with Arvind Limited (“Arvind”). PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that will produce finished products for us to distribute primarily in the United States. We expect the manufacturing facility to begin operations in the first half of 2017. 
In March 2017, we entered into agreements for a transaction to restructure our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung Trading Limited (“Li & Fung”). The transaction establishes a new strategic partnership with Li & Fung to provide services to us and also provides for the termination of our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung, pursuant to which we are obligated to source certain Calvin Klein Jeans products and at least 54% of certain Tommy Hilfiger products through Li & Fung. The transaction is expected to close July 1, 2017. Our Tommy Hilfiger business uses other third party buying offices for a portion of its sourced products and has a small in-house sourcing team that places orders directly with suppliers.
We are continuing to develop strategies and make investments in people and locations that enhance our ability to provide our customers with timely product availability and delivery. We are evolving our supply chain and building upon our operating platforms to enhance our efficiencies across the organization. Speed is a focus area across our company, as we have taken measures to reduce our lead times, leverage data to enhance our operations and simplify our processes to create a more dynamic and responsive business model, while increasing service levels, reducing inventory exposure and improving quality and consumer value. We believe the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our distribution network and overall infrastructure will allow us to better control costs and provide improved service to our customers. 
 12

The global supply chain teams monitor and track the primary cost inputs to the finished product to ensure that we pay the most appropriate cost for our finished goods. We continue to assess our manufacturing footprint to ensure we have the best infrastructure to meet the needs of our global wholesale and retail businesses.
Corporate Responsibility
Corporate responsibility is central to how we conduct business, as we recognize both the opportunity and the responsibility for businesses to take a lead role in addressing pressing global issues. We believe corporate responsibility helps strengthen our organization by managing risk, maximizing efficiencies and driving value in a rapidly changing world. Through our collective efforts, we seek to create value for both society and our business. Our corporate responsibility strategy is focused on ten commitments across three key focus areas. The strategies support 14 of the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, covering issues such as building safety, chemical management, greenhouse gases, inclusion and diversity, and supporting the needs of women and children. The three key focus areas are:

• | Empowering people — We believe that our people are the key to our future success. We are committed to investing in talent, developing our people and expanding their career development opportunities, while providing an inclusive environment where every individual is valued. We view people in our supply chain as an extension of our organization and we are committed to partnering with our business partners to help protect their employees’ rights.


• | Preserving the environment — We recognize our responsibility to address environmental impacts across our value chain, as well as the opportunity to maximize efficiencies and drive business value. This means reducing and phasing out hazardous chemicals, safeguarding water resources, innovating towards more sustainable packaging, and sourcing raw materials in a way that respects people, animals and the environment. In order to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions, we measure and analyze our impact and are establishing targets around reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency and utilizing clean energy.


• | Supporting communities — We are passionate about making a positive impact on the communities where we work and live. We aim to support the needs of women and children by creating safe spaces, improving access to education and enhancing their quality of life. We invest in local communities through partnerships with non-profit organizations, associate volunteerism and contributions.

We issue an annual report on our corporate responsibility efforts, which can be found on our corporate website.
Warehousing, Distribution and Logistics
Our products are shipped from manufacturers to our wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment. Centers range in size and our main facilities are located in the United States in Arkansas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee; and internationally in the Netherlands, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil. In North America, the two largest centers, located in Georgia and North Carolina, use fully integrated and automated distribution systems, where the bar code scanning of merchandise and cartons provide timely, accurate and instantaneous updates to the distribution system. Our warehousing and distribution centers are designed to provide responsive service to our customers and our retail stores on a cost-effective basis. This includes the use of various forms of electronic communications to meet customer needs, including advance shipping notices for certain customers.
We believe that our investments in logistics and supply chain management allow us to respond rapidly to changes in sales trends and consumer demands while enhancing inventory management. We believe our customers can better manage their inventories as a result of our continuous analysis of sales trends, broad array of product availability and quick response capabilities. Certain of our products can be ordered at any time through our EDI replenishment systems. For customers who reorder these products, we generally ship these products within one to two days of order receipt. Our backlog of customer orders totaled $1.377 billion and $1.364 billion as of January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016, respectively.
The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of the shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the basic stock replenishment program’s usage.  As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period to period may not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.

Material Customers
Our largest customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 21.3% of our revenue in 2016, 22.2% of our revenue in 2015 and 21.8% of our revenue in 2014. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Advertising and Promotion
Our marketing programs are an integral feature of our brands and their associated product offerings. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item. We intend for each of our brands to be a leader in its respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness and consumer loyalty. We believe that our brands are successful in their respective segments because we have strategically positioned each brand to target a distinct consumer demographic. We design and market our products to complement each other, satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our target consumers and encourage consumer loyalty.
The largest component of our marketing programs is digital media, including our digital commerce platforms and social media outlets, which allows us to to expand our reach to customers and enables us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion to consumers about our products, special events, promotions and store locations. In addition, we advertise through print media (including fashion, entertainment/human interest, business, men’s, women’s and sports magazines and newspapers), on television, through outdoor signage and through in-store point of sale materials, as well as participate in cooperative advertising programs with our retail partners.

We also advertise our brands through sport sponsorships and product tie-ins. Three-time PGA Tour winner Scott Piercy and 2015 PGA Tour champion David Lingmerth serve as brand ambassadors for IZOD Golf, which includes wearing IZOD Golf apparel on-course. Speedo is endorsed by world-class swimmers, including Missy Franklin and Nathan Adrian. These athletes exclusively wear Speedo products in competition, including throughout the 2016 Summer Olympics, and participate in various promotional activities on behalf of the brand. We have an all-brand, regional sponsorship agreement with the New York Giants, and CALVIN KLEIN has an ongoing sponsorship agreement with the Brooklyn Nets and the Barclays Center. 
With respect to our retail outlet operations, we generally rely upon local outlet mall developers to promote traffic for their centers. Outlet center developers employ multiple formats, including signage (highway billboards, off-highway directional signs, on-site signage and on-site information centers), print advertising (brochures, newspapers and travel magazines), direct marketing (to tour bus companies and travel agents), radio and television advertising and special promotions.
We believe CALVIN KLEIN is one of the best known designer names in the world, exemplifying bold, progressive ideals and a seductive, and often minimal, aesthetic. Its high-profile, often cutting-edge global advertising campaigns have periodically garnered significant publicity, notoriety and conversation among customers and consumers, as well as within the fashion industry, and have helped to establish and maintain the CALVIN KLEIN name and image. Calvin Klein has a dedicated in-house advertising agency, with experienced creative and media teams that develop and execute a substantial portion of the institutional consumer advertising for products under the CALVIN KLEIN brands and work closely with other Calvin Klein departments and business partners to deliver a cohesive and aspirational brand message to the consumer. Calvin Klein maintains multiple showroom facilities and sales offices in Europe, North and South America and Asia. 
Creatively, CALVIN KLEIN had a tremendous year in 2016. With a focus on digital consumer engagement, the successful #mycalvins concept was evolved into a 360° lifestyle campaign for Spring. Its call-to-action, “I _____ in #mycalvins”, continued through the Fall season and asked the consumer “What do you do in yours?.” The Spring and Fall campaigns each featured a diverse group of pop culture influencers, including actors, musicians, athletes, fashion icons and artists. Through the campaigns, we took a significant step toward showcasing the “World of CALVIN KLEIN” with each of the CALVIN KLEIN brands being featured together in a true lifestyle presentation, as opposed to a single classification-based approach. Additionally, in January 2017, Calvin Klein debuted Calvin Klein By Appointment, a bespoke collection of distinct looks handcrafted and made to measure in New York, New York. The collection is a new high luxury tier of product for us, available exclusively by appointment beginning April 1, 2017. The launch was accompanied by a new advertising campaign, which was featured on calvinklein.com, the brand’s official social media channels, and in print, digital and outdoor advertising in New York, New York, Los Angeles, California, Paris, France, Milan, Italy, London, England, Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, China and Seoul, South Korea. 
Calvin Klein also has a dedicated in-house global communications team, which incorporates corporate communications, public relations, celebrity dressing and special events. This group coordinates many global events to support 
 14

the brand and business, including the Spring and Fall CALVIN KLEIN 205 W39 NYC runway shows, and oversees the dressing of celebrities for events, award ceremonies and film premieres. 
We believe that Tommy Hilfiger is one of the world’s leading designer lifestyle brands and is internationally recognized for celebrating the essence of classic American cool style featuring preppy with a twist designs. Tommy Hilfiger employs advertising, marketing and communications staff, including an in-house creative team, as well as outside agencies, to implement its global marketing and communications strategy across all channels of distribution. The Tommy Hilfiger marketing and communications team develops and coordinates Tommy Hilfiger advertising for all regions and product lines, licensees and regional distributors. Advertisements for Tommy Hilfiger brand products appear primarily in fashion and lifestyle magazines, newspapers, outdoor media and cinema and on television. The digital and online focus of marketing for the Tommy Hilfiger brands is integral to its campaigns and continues to increase. Additionally, the marketing and communications team coordinates personal appearances by Mr. Tommy Hilfiger, including at runway shows, brand events and flagship store openings as part of its efforts. Tommy Hilfiger maintains multiple showroom facilities and sales offices in Europe, North and South America and Asia, as well as innovative digital sales showrooms located in Tommy Hilfiger offices around the world that enhance the sales experience for wholesale accounts. 
Significant Tommy Hilfiger marketing campaigns are launched two times per year in Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter to provide maximum consumer visibility of the new seasonal collections and to support sell-throughs. Marketing and consumer engagement continued to drive the brand forward in 2016, particularly in support of the brand’s global growth categories, including underwear, men’s tailored clothing and women’s apparel and accessories. One of the brand’s highest profile campaigns was its Fall 2016 marketing campaign featuring Gigi Hadid as the global brand ambassador for womenswear. The partnership was meaningful for Tommy Hilfiger, as it enabled the brand to capitalize on her impressive social media following, which was in excess of 28 million followers as of January 2017. The marketing campaign was accompanied by the TommyXGigi Capsule collection, which launched at New York Fashion Week in September 2016, along with the #TOMMYNOW “Buy Now. Wear Now.” concept that made the runway collection immediately available for purchase across all sales channels, including throughout our retail partner network globally. On the men’s side, Tommy Hilfiger continued its successful partnership with Rafael Nadal, who serves as the global brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger underwear, Tommy Hilfiger Tailored and the Tommy Hilfiger Bold fragrance. 

In addition to offering a broad array of apparel and licensed products, our flagship digital commerce sites, Tommy Hilfiger’s digital commerce site, tommy.com, and Calvin Klein’s digital commerce site, calvinklein.com, also serve as marketing vehicles to complement the ongoing development of the Tommy Hilfiger and CALVIN KLEIN lifestyle brands, respectively.
Our Heritage Brands business also utilizes marketing campaigns to support its new product launches. The Van Heusen Flex Collection was supported by point of sale signage and print advertising to communicate the breadth of the collection and key product features. We also continued to advertise the Warner’s No Side Effects bra on television during 2016, as this collection continues to perform well. Additionally, Speedo Fit, a line of swimsuits and accessories targeted to recreational athletes, was advertised on television and through online videos featuring Olympic swimmers during 2016.
Trademarks
We own the CALVIN KLEIN, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner’s, Olga and Eagle brands, as well as related trademarks (e.g., the interlocking “IZ” logo for IZOD and the Tommy Hilfiger flag logo and crest design) and lesser-known names. These trademarks are registered for use in each of the primary countries where our products are sold and additional applications for registration of these and other trademarks are made in jurisdictions to accommodate new marks, uses in additional trademark classes or additional categories of goods or expansion into new countries.
We own the CALVIN KLEIN marks and derivative marks in all trademark classes and for all product categories through our ownership of Calvin Klein and Warnaco. Calvin Klein and Warnaco together own the Calvin Klein Trademark Trust (“the Trust”), which is the sole and exclusive title owner of substantially all registrations of the CALVIN KLEIN trademarks. The sole purpose of the Trust is to hold these marks. Calvin Klein maintains and protects the marks on behalf of the Trust pursuant to a servicing agreement. The Trust licenses to Calvin Klein and Warnaco on an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual and royalty-free basis the use of the marks.
Mr. Calvin Klein retains the right to use his name, on a non-competitive basis, with respect to his right of publicity, unless those rights are already being used in the Calvin Klein business. Mr. Klein has also been granted a royalty-free worldwide right to use the CALVIN KLEIN mark with respect to certain personal businesses and activities, such as motion picture, television and video businesses, a book business, writing, speaking and teaching engagements, non-commercial 
 15

photography, charitable activities and architectural and industrial design projects, subject to certain limitations designed to protect the image and prestige of the CALVIN KLEIN brands and to avoid competitive conflicts.
Mr. Tommy Hilfiger is prohibited in perpetuity from using, or authorizing others to use, the Tommy Hilfiger marks (except for the use by Mr. Hilfiger of his name personally and in connection with certain specified activities). In addition, we are prohibited in perpetuity from selling products not ordinarily sold under the names of prestige designer businesses or prestige global lifestyle brands without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, from engaging in new lines of business materially different from such types of lines of business without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, or from disparaging or intentionally tarnishing the Tommy Hilfiger-related marks or Mr. Hilfiger’s personal name. 
Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of apparel, footwear and related products, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of new and related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks continue to be used in connection with the products and services with which they are identified and, as to registered tradenames, the required registration renewals are filed. In markets outside of the United States, particularly those where products bearing any of our brands are not sold by us or any of our licensees or other authorized users, our rights to the use of trademarks may not be clearly established.
Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets and we vigorously seek to protect them on a worldwide basis against infringement. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. This is especially the case with respect to the CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger brands, as these brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and their generally higher pricing provides significant opportunity and incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. We have broad, proactive enforcement programs that we believe have been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the United States and in major markets abroad. 
Competition
The apparel industry is competitive as a result of its fashion orientation, mix of large and small producers, the flow of domestic and imported merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, including, in certain circumstances, the private label brands of our wholesale customers.
We compete primarily on the basis of style, quality, price and service. Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in these areas. We believe we are well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry. Our diversified portfolio of brands and products and our use of multiple channels of distribution have allowed us to develop a business that produces results that are not dependent on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or geographic region. We have developed a portfolio of brands that appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers. Our owned brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition and awareness within their respective consumer segments. We develop our owned and licensed brands to complement each other and to generate strong consumer loyalty. The CALVIN KLEIN and Tommy Hilfiger brands generally provide us with the opportunity to develop businesses that target different consumer groups at higher price points and in higher-end distribution channels than our heritage brands, as well as with significant global opportunities due to the worldwide recognition of the brands.
Imports and Import Restrictions
A substantial portion of our products is imported into the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. These products are subject to various customs laws, which may impose tariffs, as well as quota restrictions. Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) agreement governing international trade in textiles, known as the “WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,” the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions generally do not affect our business in most countries. We are subject to numerous international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Africa Growth & Opportunity Act, Central American Free Trade Agreement, Jordan Free Trade Agreement, Israel Free Trade Agreement, Egypt Qualifying Industrial Zones, Colombia Free Trade Agreement, Peru Free Trade Agreement and other special trade programs. Presently, a portion of our imported products is eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs. In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the United States and the other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may impose, from time to time, new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of a “safeguard quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product 
 16

design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries and manufacturers and geographical diversification of our sources of supply.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations.
Employees
As of January 29, 2017, we employed approximately 18,800 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 15,700 persons on a part-time basis. Approximately 3% of our employees were represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by five different unions in the United States. Additional persons, some represented by these five unions, are employed from time to time based upon our manufacturing schedules and retailing seasonal needs. Our collective bargaining agreements generally are for one to three-year terms. In some international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by governmental labor arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
