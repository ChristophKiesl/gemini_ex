ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Corporate Profile
Cognex Corporation was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1981. Our corporate headquarters are located at One Vision Drive, Natick, Massachusetts 01760 and our telephone number is (508) 650-3000.
Cognex is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate manufacturing and distribution tasks where vision is required. Machine vision is the technology that gives computers and automation equipment the ability to see. Machine vision products are used to automate the manufacturing and tracking of discrete items, such as mobile phones, aspirin bottles, and automobile tires, by locating, identifying, inspecting, and measuring them during the manufacturing or distribution process. Machine vision is important for applications in which human vision is inadequate to meet requirements for size, accuracy, or speed, or in instances where substantial cost savings are obtained through the reduction of labor or improved product quality. 
Although Cognex sells to customers in a variety of industries, our largest industries are the consumer electronics, logistics, and automotive industries, which combined represented approximately 70% of our total revenue in 2020. While we sell to a variety of customers in the automotive industry, we have two large customers in the consumer electronics and logistics industries that each represented a significant portion of revenue in their respective industries and each represented over 10% of our total revenue in 2020. Our total revenue and quarterly timing of revenue is impacted by the purchasing cycles of these two large customers.
Cognex operates in one segment, machine vision technology. We offer a variety of machine vision products that have similar economic characteristics, have the same production processes, and are distributed by the same sales channels to the same types of customers. 
Machine Vision Market
Cognex machine vision is used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries, where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, and medical-related. Cognex products are also used to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers. 
Although we consider Cognex to be one of the leading machine vision companies in the world, reliable estimates of the machine vision market and the number and relative size of competitors are not readily available. Our competitors include other vendors of machine vision systems, controllers, and components; manufacturers of image processing systems, sensors, and components; and system integrators. We may also compete with internal engineering departments of current or prospective customers, as well as open source tools available for free by various companies. In recent years, we have encountered increased competition from low-cost vision providers in China.

Cognex’s ability to compete depends upon our ability to design, manufacture, and sell high-quality products, as well as our ability to develop new products and functionality that meet evolving customer requirements. The primary competitive factors affecting the choice of a machine vision system include vendor reputation, product functionality and performance, ease of use, price, and post-sales support. The importance of each of these factors varies depending upon the specific customer’s needs.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to expand our position as a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products for industrial customers. We are selective in choosing growth opportunities that we believe will maintain our historically high gross margin percentages, which have ranged in the mid 70 percent range for the past several years and reflect the value our customers place on our innovative products. Our high gross margins have the potential to provide us with strong operating leverage in our financial model, as any incremental revenue at such margins falls through to operating income at a high ratio. Our strong and unique corporate culture reinforces our values of customer first and innovation, and enables us to attract and retain smart, highly educated, experienced talent who are motivated to solve the most challenging vision tasks.
We invest heavily in research and development in order to maintain our position as a technology leader in machine vision. We invest in technology that makes vision easier to use and more affordable, and therefore, available to a broader base of customers, such as our vision sensor products that enable customers with a lower budget to use machine vision without the help of sophisticated engineers. We also invest in technology that addresses the most challenging vision applications, such as our 3D vision products that solve applications where a height or volume measurement is required and our deep learning vision software that solves complex applications with unpredictable defects and deviations. We invest through internal development, as well as the acquisition of businesses and technologies. We believe that our acquisition of Sualab Co., Ltd. in 2019 will continue to expand our deep learning technology to visual inspection tasks that could replace human inspectors and make automated inspection tasks fast, easy, and cost-effective.
We continue to invest in our core markets, such as consumer electronics and automotive, where we are a leading provider of vision and ID products for factory automation, while making significant investments in the logistics market, where we are moving beyond barcode reading into more complex applications in retail distribution and ecommerce.
We reach a broad base of customers through our worldwide direct sales force that sells to large, strategic customers, as well as through our network of distributors and integrators that sell primarily to smaller customers who may be more geographically remote and may require supplemental technical support or integration assistance. We invest in emerging, high-growth regions where many manufacturers can benefit from incorporating machine vision into their production processes. This includes investment in China, where rising wages for assembly workers and a greater focus on product quality are driving assembly automation, particularly in the consumer electronics industry.
Acquisitions
Our business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision applications and markets through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. 
On October 16, 2019, Cognex acquired Sualab Co., Ltd. (Sualab), a provider of deep learning-based vision software for industrial image analysis based in Korea. The total consideration of approximately $194 million included cash payments of $170 million and deferred payments of $24 million that may become payable on the fourth anniversary date of the closing, contingent upon continued employment of key talent. Sualab's intellectual property, engineering expertise, and market coverage are expected to increase the Company's deep learning capabilities. Combined with intellectual property acquired from ViDi Systems S.A. in 2017, we believe that Cognex is now a leading provider of deep learning-based industrial vision software. 
Management considers business acquisitions to be an important part of our growth strategy, and although we continue to actively seek out acquisition opportunities, we are selective in choosing businesses that we believe will enhance our long-term growth rate and profitability, as well as fit within our corporate culture. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our product lines, customer base, distribution network, and technical talent through acquisitions in the machine vision industry.

Vision software offers customers the flexibility of the Cognex vision tools library to use with the cameras, frame grabbers, and peripheral equipment of their choice. Cognex VisionPro® software offers an extensive suite of patented vision tools for advanced programming, while Cognex Designer™ allows customers to build complete vision applications with the simplicity of a graphical, flowchart-based programming environment. Cognex Deep Learning software solves difficult applications that are too complicated and time-consuming to program and maintain with traditional machine vision rule-based algorithms.
Industrial Image-Based Barcode Readers
Cognex image-based barcode readers quickly and reliably read 1D, 2D, and direct part mark (DPM) codes found in nearly every industry including automotive, consumer products, medical-related, and logistics. The DataMan® product line, which includes fixed-mount, handheld, and mobile models, as well as barcode verifiers, help organizations optimize performance, increase throughput, and control traceability.
Research, Development, and Engineering
Cognex engages in research, development, and engineering (RD&E) to enhance our existing products and to develop new products and functionality to address market opportunities. In addition to internal research and development efforts, we intend to continue our strategy of gaining access to new technology through strategic relationships and acquisitions where appropriate.
RD&E expenses as a percentage of revenue were 16% in 2020, 16% in 2019, and 14% in 2018. We believe that a continued commitment to RD&E activities is essential in order to maintain or achieve product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, as well as to provide engineering support for large customers. In addition, we consider our ability to accelerate time to market for new products to be critical to our revenue growth. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD&E investments in the future, and intend to continue our product development plans during periods of lower revenue levels. At any point in time, we have numerous research and development projects underway.
We rely on the technical expertise, creativity, and knowledge of our personnel, and therefore, we utilize patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection to maintain our competitive position and protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. While our intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property right.
Manufacturing and Order Fulfillment
Cognex’s products are manufactured utilizing a turnkey operation whereby the majority of component procurement, system assembly, and initial testing are performed by third-party contract manufacturers. Cognex’s primary contract manufacturer is located in Indonesia. The contract manufacturers use specified components sourced from a vendor list approved by Cognex and assembly/test documentation created and controlled by Cognex. Certain components are presently sourced from a single vendor that is selected based on price and performance considerations. In the event of a supply disruption from a single-source vendor, these components may be purchased from alternative vendors. 
After the completion of initial testing, a fully-assembled product from the contract manufacturers is routed to our distribution centers in Cork, Ireland or Natick, Massachusetts, USA, where trained Cognex personnel load Cognex software onto the product and perform quality control procedures. Fully-configured finished products for customers in the Americas, with the exception of certain products stocked locally in Mexico, are then shipped from our Natick,
