Our filings are available on www.sec.gov.
Products
 
Cannabinoids are chemical compounds that exert a range of effects on the body, including impacting the immune response, gastrointestinal maintenance and motility, muscle functioning, and nervous system response and functioning. Phytocannabinoids are cannabinoids that occur naturally in the cannabis plant, they are abundant in the viscous resin produced by glandular structures called trichomes. There are over 480 different compounds in the cannabis plant.  Many of them have been identified as cannabinoids. Of these THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive component (“high”) in the plant with many therapeutic uses.  The other broadly pursued non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid, CBD (Cannabidiol), is pleiotropic influencing many pathways in humans, dogs, and cats and may be used to provide relief to a variety of symptoms including pain, seizures, and eating disorders.
 
The Company is focused on four products that it is preparing  for medical trials: Natrinol is a natural substitute for Marinol, or synthetic THC. This product is aimed at relieving nausea, vomiting and increasing appetite in patients with AIDS and Cancer.  Caesafin uses combination therapy to alleviate seizures in dogs and cats.  Serosapse addresses several end points in Parkinson’s disease including Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep disorder, anxiety, and dyskinesia. Hyalolex is aimed at reducing the buildup of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer’s patients.
 
Services
 
The Company provides construction management services for the construction of a 7-star hotel in Genting Malaysia.  In India the Company rents heavy equipment with operators to construction companies.

Industry Overview
 
We believe that there are three factors coalescing to create entrepreneurial opportunities in the cannaceutical industry. The first is deregulation of the industry. This is taking place in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and other parts of the world. We believe that during any major deregulation, it takes several years for market equilibrium to be achieved. Most large companies don’t react quickly and that creates entrepreneurial opportunities, including as a first mover. The second factor is that the plant has cannabinoids that work on several pathways, in humans and animals, and that these cannabinoids can potentially be used to treat many diseases and aliments. The third factor is a rising awareness and demand for natural products including natural complementary and alternative medicines.
Target Markets
 
 We are developing four products using phytocannabinoid-based combination and mono therapies, for the treatment of a) Alzheimer’s disease, b) several end points associated with Parkinson’s disease, c) seizures in cats and dogs, and d) cancer and AIDS induced nausea, vomiting, and eating disorders.  Our target market for one of these products is very large and for the other three relatively smaller. There are 5.3 million adults suffering from Alzheimer’s in the U.S., and Medicare and Medicate are projected to spend $175 billion in 2017 on treatment. Alzheimer’s is America’s most expensive disease. The pharmaceutical market for this product, if it is proven effective in medical trials, and approved by the FDA, and we are successful in registering with the USPTO, is significant and rapidly growing. There are over one million adults suffering from Parkinson’s disease in the U.S., it is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide with an estimated 1% of adults over 60 suffering from the disease.  The market for curing the disease is very large. We are testing products for end points (REM sleep disorder, anxiety, dyskinesia) associated with Parkinson’s disease and we believe the market for these products is projected to be around $500 million. There are 160 million domesticated dogs and cats in the U.S. and about 1% suffer from seizures. Our veterinarian product uses combination therapy for the treatment of seizures in dogs and cats.  We are also developing a product for cancer and AIDS induced nausea, vomiting, and eating disorders.
 
The target market for the heavy equipment rental business is cyclical and highly dependent on the fleet of equipment available at the time a need arises.  We have a limited fleet of heavy equipment in India and the target market is small and restricted to the city of Kochi in the state of Kerala, India. Similarly, the construction management business is limited to project development in Genting Malaysia. We have, organically and through our investments, developed expertise in building medical grade pesticide free indoor organic farms, and extraction and separation methodologies using a variety of techniques. While we believe the target market for these services will be large, we have not yet begun targeting these markets.
 
Patents, Development Pipeline, and Licenses
 
Although, the Company believes the registration of patents is an important part of its business strategy and its success depends in part on such registration, the Company cannot guarantee that such patent filings will result in a successful registration with the USPTO.  Please see risk factors.
 
We have filed six provisional patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in the phytocannabinoid-based combination therapy space, for the indications of pain, medical refractory epilepsy, and cachexia. In addition, in May 2017, we acquired an exclusive license to a patent filed by the University of South Florida Research Foundation entitled “THC as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer’s Disease”.  The table below provides a status of the patent filings:

Alzheimer’s Disease
 Alzheimer’s is known as America’s most expensive disease with an estimated cost in 2017 to Medicare and Medicaid of $175 billion. There are currently over 5.3 million Americans with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and around 35 million worldwide. The cost of Alzheimer’s is skyrocketing as the baby-boomers age: the number of AD patients is expected to double over the next 20 years and the direct costs are expected to exceed $450 billion in the next 12 years.  Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is believed to be between three and nine years.  It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. Currently, no treatment can stop or reverse the progression of the disease and there is still no accepted cure for AD.  Alzheimer’s is characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions – resulting in significant atrophy in the affected regions.  In brains of those affected by Alzheimer’s, both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are visible by microscopy.  Amyloid plaques are dense deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material around neurons.  Neurofibrillary tangles are aggregates of the microtubule-associate protein tau, which accumulates inside the cells. The patent filing made by the University of South Florida Research Foundation claims discovery of a new pathway to disrupt and perhaps reverse the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques from aggregating on neurons.
Pain
 
The pain market represents a significant component of the healthcare system and The Journal of Pain in September 2012 reported that the annual estimated national cost of pain ranges from $560 billion to $635 billion.  This figure exceeds the entire cost of the nation’s priority health conditions.  Additionally, The American Pain Society recommends that pain be made more visible and be categorized as the fifth vital sign; recognizing that terminal illnesses are often accompanied by unbearable levels that are so severe and difficult to treat that death seems preferable. According to the Arthritis Foundation, arthritis has been particularly problematic for women; since 1999 there has been a 22 percent increase in the number of women who attribute their disability to arthritis.  Current treatment protocols such as the utilization of opioid-based drug therapies present several challenges and may result in debilitating consequences that affect patient day-to-day functioning and patients’ productivity. Commonly reported side effects include hallucinations, constipation, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, and dysphoria. Our patent filing is based on a novel therapy that uses extracts from the cannabis plant for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and scleroderma pain. The therapy uses a cream that is applied to the joints, using a variety of delivery mechanisms including a bio-adhesive patch.
Seizures
 
Approximately 50 million people worldwide are affected by epilepsy (Sanders, 2003).  Epilepsy is thought to be due to multiple factors that include sodium, potassium, GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) and NMDA (N-Methyl-d-aspartate).  It is believed, for example, that to maximally control epilepsy, modulation of one or more of these receptors is required and that mono therapy is adequate in up to 25% of patients.  The onset of epileptic seizures can be life threatening, including long-term implications (Lutz, 2004) such as mental health problems, cognitive deficits and morphological changes (Swann, 2004, Avoli et. al., 2005). The onset of epilepsy also greatly affects lifestyle as sufferers live in fear of consequential injury or the inability to perform daily tasks (Fisher et. al., 2000). The scientific community (1980 Cunha et. al., 1986 Ames, 1990 Trembly et. al. recent testing by GW Pharmaceuticals, among others) have shown that Cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-convulsive properties in humans.  Other studies, (Davis and Ramsey) have shown that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can also help reduce seizures.  Three of our patent filings involving novel therapies use phytocannabinoid extracts from cannabis, in combination with other generic drugs, to treat medical refractory epilepsy in humans and seizures in dogs and cats.
Eating Disorders
 
Cachexia is a condition that accompanies severe illness such as cancer and results in the weakness and wasting away of the body. Cachexia physically weakens patients to the extent that response to standard treatments is poor.  In the U.S., it is estimated that a population of approximately 1.3 million are experiencing cachexia associated with cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, HIV/AIDS and other progressive illnesses. Cachexia is secondary to an underlying disease such as cancer or AIDS and is a positive risk factor for death.  As an example, cancer induced anorexia cachexia is responsible for about 20% of all cancer deaths.  Our patent filing involves a novel therapy that uses phytocannabinoids to stimulate senses (smell and taste) with a combination of drugs to stimulate appetite.  Our approach addresses the veterinarian market as dogs and cats also suffer from pain, epilepsy and cachexia and getting a product to market for the veterinarian industry is significantly less time consuming than getting products approved for human healthcare.

Competition
 
The development of phytocannabinoid-based therapies is currently not very competitive. The largest amount of research in this area is done in Israel. The most significant research and FDA approved trials are done by one large pharmaceutical company, and to a lesser extent by two other large firms. In the United States, there is very little wide spread research while most of the research is concentrated in Israel. This is mostly because the United States Drug Enforcement Administrating (“DEA”) classifies phytocannabinoid extracts as a Schedule 1 drug. This means that phytocannabinoids are characterized as “high potential for abuse,” and “no currently accepted medical use”. Further, any study conducted in the US must be registered and approved by the DEA and raw materials purchased through the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA).
 
We view competition in two ways, the first: we compete with 15 listed companies and 2 private companies that have articulated a business plan to develop phytocannabinoid based therapies, two large listed well-funded pharmaceutical companies, and three small listed companies. There are several microcap companies listed on the OTC and two private ones that also compete in this space.  We have limited competition in the areas of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and seizures for dogs and cats, using phytocannabinoid- based therapies. In the field of epilepsy in humans there is significant competition and so we are focused on seizures in dogs and cats where there is limited competition.  The second way we view competition is non-phytocannabinoid based therapies: there is severe competition in all areas that we are working on including for example Alzheimer’s, with almost all the massive and well financed pharmaceutical companies and four pure play listed companies working on the disease, albeit all of them without the use of phytocannabinoids.

Our Other Businesses and Investments
 In Malaysia, our subsidiary Cabaran Ultima is the project manager of an estimated $262 million five-star hotel planned to be built on approximately 6 plus acres in Genting highlands. Genting is a hill resort one hour from Kuala Lumpur that boasts many attractions including a casino and is home to the 20th Century Fox World theme park slated to open in 2017. The site is located within walking distance to the theme park and casino.  HBA Architecture, the hotel’s master planner and designer, have a prestigious design resume that includes numerous developments such as the Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel Refurbishment in Vietnam, Marrisle Boutique Leisure Resort and Club Med Gongshan Island Resort, both located in China.  During the build-out phase we expect to receive revenue from project management. Ultima’s market share of the real estate project planning, construction, and management industry in Malaysia is less than 1%.
 According to Deloitte and KOTRA, the total market size of the construction industry in India is estimated at $126 billion.  However, various plans by the Indian government to build and modernize Indian infrastructure have been slow to materialize.  Through our subsidiary, TBL, we are engaged in renting heavy infrastructure construction equipment.  Our subsidiary has experience in the construction industry having in the past, constructed highways, rural roads, tunnels, dams, airport runways and housing complexes, mostly in southern Indian states.  Our current share of the overall market in India is less than 1% based on revenue.

In Hong Kong, through a majority owned subsidiary called Golden Gate that we renamed as IGC International, we operated an electronics business. Most of our revenue in fiscal 2016 come from that business. We had no revenue from Golden Gate since the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  We decided to exit this business because, we believe, there is a macroeconomic slow-down and consolidation in the electronic-components sector, and without scale, meaningfully competing is difficult.  IGC-INT’s share of the electronic trading market is less than 1% based on revenue.
 
In China, through a majority owned subsidiary called Ironman, we operated our iron ore business. As of March 31, 2016, we had three iron ore beneficiation plants in China, including the one under construction (under capital work-in progress), for about $6.1 million.  As of March 31, 2017, IGC has redeemed and subsequently retired as required by Maryland State law, part of the 3,150,000 shares of common stock issued in connection with its purchase of Ironman for all tangible operating assets of Ironman as a treasury stock transaction thus reducing IGC investment in Ironman to zero while still pursuing any and all legal avenues to recover as many of the originally issued shares. After December 31, 2016, Ironman is no longer consolidated. Ironman’s share of the iron ore trading market is less than 1% based on revenue.
 In June 2014, we entered into a partnership agreement with TerraSphere Systems LLC to develop multiple facilities to produce organic leafy green vegetables utilizing TerraSphere’s advanced pesticide-free organic indoor farming technology. Under the agreement, we will own 51% of each venture once production is operational, and will have a right of first refusal to participate in all future build-outs. Additionally, in consideration for our issuance of 50,000 shares of common stock, we received a seven-year option to purchase TerraSphere Systems for cash or additional shares of our common stock. As of 2017, we are negotiating a conversion of the investment into shares of a Canadian public vehicle that TerraSphere has merged into.
 In December 2014, we acquired 24.9% of the outstanding membership interests in Midtown Partners, a Florida limited liability company registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, from Apogee Financial Investments, Inc.  The Purchase Agreement expired on June 30, 2015, and the Company is pursuing its rights under the terms of the Purchase Agreement to recover certain damages.  In the calendar year 2017, Midtown Partners had a profit.  The Company applied the equity method of accounting for investments and increased the value of its investment in Midtown Partners by 24.9% of the profit earned by Midtown Partner in the calendar year 2017.  Midtown’s share of the investment banking market is less than 1% based on revenue.
 
We acquired a 10% stake in a 1,000-room luxury hotel development project encompassing 6+ acres in Genting Highlands, Malaysia by subscribing to 10% stake in Brilliant Hallmark Sdn. Bhd. (“Brilliant”) free and clear of all encumbrances. On April 3, 2017, IGC sold back its ten percent holding in Brilliant Hallmark for a consideration of 4 million shares of IGC’s Common Stock that were returned and retired, thereby reducing the outstanding IGC shares in April 2017.  The Company does not expect to record a gain or loss from this transaction.

Customers
 
For the four Phytocannabinoid-based products that are in the development phase, we have no customers and no revenue.  For the electronic business we had 32 customers.  For the hotel development business located in Malaysia we have one customer. For our equipment leasing business located in India we have seven customers all of whom are construction companies.  One customer in Malaysia accounted for more than 42% of our revenue.
Growth and Expansion Strategy
 
Our growth and expansion strategy is to conduct medical trials on our four products, develop joint venture partners for marketing our products, and continue to develop new products for PTSD and depression.  We currently do not expect to expand the real estate management or rental businesses.
Sales and Marketing
 
For phytocannabinoid-based therapies we have no sales or marketing.  For the electronic business, that we have exited, our sales force was located in Hong Kong and China and the sales cycle lasted between one and two weeks.  For the hotel development business, our sales force is located in Malaysia where we have one customer, and for our equipment leasing business our sales force is located in Kochi, India where the sales cycle lasts around two months.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 
We have intellectual property attorneys that file patents or provisional patent applications, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws of general applicability, employee confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements, and other intellectual property protection methods to safeguard our technology, research and development. We have applied for preliminary patents on phytocannabinoid-based therapies in the areas of pain management, medical refractory epilepsy, eating disorders and cachexia. The Company holds all rights to the patents that have been filed by us with the USPTO.
Employees and Consultants
 
As of March 31, 2017, we employed a work force of approximately 31 employees and contract workers in the United States, India and Malaysia. We have a total of 16 full-time employees with the rest being part-time, seasonal, or advisors that are highly qualified in their specific areas of expertise.
Governmental Regulations and Approvals
 
In the United States, 26 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and The District of Columbia have allowed (subject to licensing) the cultivation, processing and sale of cannabis. However, cannabis including certain phytocannabinoids derived from the plant, specifically the psychoactive compound Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the non-psychoactive, medically useful compound Cannabidiol (CBD) are both considered to be Schedule 1 drugs under the Control Substances Act (CSA). The implication for us is that testing to determine drug efficacy and toxicity screening of our formulations in the US will require procedural registration and approval from the DEA and sourcing from the NIDA.  For our products to be sold we would have to conduct FDA approved trials that will take between two and seven years. Regulatory approvals for applications in the veterinarian space are significantly shorter and this is an area that we are focused on.
 
Our business is impacted by government regulations surrounding the transfer of money to and from foreign countries.  India, Malaysia, and China have strict foreign exchange regulations that make it difficult to move money in and out of these countries.  Because we are a US based company we are subject to US laws that govern money laundering and this results in arduous amounts of paper work, delays, and extreme amounts of scrutiny, all of which are expensive.

Corporate History
 
In February 2007, we incorporated India Globalization Capital, Mauritius, Limited (“IGC-M”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, under the laws of Mauritius.  In March 2008, we completed acquisitions of interests in two companies in India, Sricon Infrastructure Private Limited (“Sricon”) and Techni Bharathi Limited (“TBL”).  Since March 31, 2013, we beneficially own 100% of TBL after completing the acquisition of the remaining 23.13% of TBL shares that were still owned by the founders of TBL. The 23.13% of TBL was acquired by IGC-MPL, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IGC-M. TBL shares are held by IGC-M. TBL is focused on the heavy equipment leasing business. In October 2014, pursuant to a Memorandum of Settlement with Sricon and related parties and in exchange for the 22% minority interest we had in Sricon, we received approximately five acres of prime land in Nagpur, India. The land is located a few miles from MIHAN, which is the largest development zone in terms of investment in India. The Company beneficially registered the land in its name on March 4, 2016.
 
In February 2009, IGC-M beneficially purchased 100% of IGC Mining and Trading Private Limited (“IGC-IMT”) based in Chennai, India.  In July 2009, IGC-M beneficially purchased 100% of IGC Materials, Private Limited (“IGC-MPL”) and 100% of IGC Logistics, Private Limited (“IGC-LPL”) both based in Nagpur, India.  Together, these companies conducted our iron ore, cement, aggregate, and other materials, trading, transport and delivery businesses.
 
In December 2011, we acquired a 95% equity interest in Linxi HeFei Economic and Trade Co., known as Linxi H&F Economic and Trade Co., a People’s Republic of China-based company (“PRC Ironman”), by acquiring 100% of the equity of H&F Ironman Limited, a Hong Kong company (“HK Ironman”). Together, PRC Ironman and HK Ironman are referred to as “Ironman.” In February 2015, IGC filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of Maryland, against 24 defendants related to the acquisition of Ironman, seeking to have the court order rescission of the underlying Acquisition Agreement and to void any past or future transfer of IGC shares.  Between December 30, 2016 and February 24, 2017, IGC redeemed and subsequently retired as required by Maryland State law, approximately 2.4 million shares of IGC’s common stock issued in connection with its purchase of Ironman as a treasury stock transaction thus reducing IGC investment in Ironman to zero while still pursuing any and all legal avenues to recover as many of the originally issued shares of 3,150,000.  The assets of Ironman are shown on the balance sheet of IGC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 but not for fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.  Please see the risk factor on Ironman and the financial Note 3 on the accounting impact on IGC’s balance sheet.
 
In January 2013, we incorporated IGC HK Mining and Trading Limited (“IGC-HK”) in Hong Kong. IGC-HK is a wholly owned subsidiary of IGC-M. In September 2014, we changed the subsidiary’s name to IGC Cleantech Ltd (“IGC-CT”). See Note 25 Subsequent Events for an update.
 
In May 2014, we completed the acquisition of 51% of the outstanding share capital of Golden Gate Electronics Limited (“Golden Gate”), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong and now known as IGC International (“IGC-INT”). IGC-INT, headquartered in Hong Kong, operates an e-commerce platform for the trading of commodities and electronic components. The purchase price of the acquisition consisted of up to 1,209,765 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $1.05 million on the closing date of the acquisition. The terms of the Acquisition Agreement called for the delivery of 205,661 shares of IGC common stock at the signing of the Agreement and the remaining 1,004,094 shares were contingent on the electronics business meeting annual thresholds for revenue and profit through fiscal year ending on March 31, 2017.  The contingent shares were not delivered because IGC International was unable to meet the targets. As of March 31, 2017, we exited the business. We retired 205,661 shares of common stock, and returned control of IGC International to the original owners.  We also impaired the goodwill associated with the acquisition. We have no disputes with the initial principals of Golden Gate.
 
In June 2014, we entered into a partnership agreement with TerraSphere Systems LLC to develop multiple facilities to produce organic leafy green vegetables utilizing TerraSphere’s advanced pesticide-free organic indoor farming technology. Under the agreement, we will own 51% of each venture once production is operational, and will have a right of first refusal to participate in all future build-outs. Additionally, in consideration for our issuance of 50,000 shares of common stock, we received a seven-year option to purchase TerraSphere Systems for cash or additional shares of our common stock. In fiscal 2018, we expect to convert this investment into shares of a public Canadian company where assets including this project is being merged.
 
In December 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Apogee Financial Investments, Inc. (“Apogee”), the previous majority and sole owner of the outstanding membership interests of Midtown Partners & Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Midtown Partners”), to acquire 24.9% of the outstanding membership interests in Midtown Partners, and pursuant to certain conditions, subsequently 100%.  In consideration of the initial membership interest of 24.9%, we issued 1,200,000 shares of our common stock, valued at approximately $888,000 in the name of Apogee.
