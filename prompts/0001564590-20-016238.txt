 Item 1.Business
 Overview
 The principal business of Quorum Health Corporation and its subsidiaries is to provide hospital and outpatient healthcare services in our markets across the United States. As of December 31, 2019, we owned or leased a diversified portfolio of 24 hospitals in rural and mid-sized markets, which are located in 14 states and have a total of 1,995 licensed beds. In addition, through Quorum Health Resources LLC (“QHR”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, we provide a wide range of hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services. Over 95% of our net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were attributable to our hospital operations business, and the remainder related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business.
 Our company became an independent, publicly-traded company on April 29, 2016 upon the spin-off (“Spin-off”) of 38 hospitals, their affiliated facilities and QHR from Community Health Systems, Inc. (“CHS” or “Parent” when referring to the carve-out period prior to April 29, 2016). In connection with the Spin-off, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Senior Notes”) on April 22, 2016 and entered into a credit agreement on April 29, 2016, consisting of an $880 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), or on a combined basis referred to as the “Senior Credit Facility.” In addition, we entered into a $125 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”). The net offering proceeds of the Senior Notes, together with the net borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, were used to make a $1.2 billion payment from us to CHS and to pay our transaction and financing fees and expenses. For additional terms of the Spin-off and related financing transactions, including the transition services agreements between us and CHS, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — The Spin-Off.”
 Throughout this Form 10-K, we refer to Quorum Health Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries in a simplified manner and on a collective basis, using words like “QHC,” “we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company.” This drafting style is suggested by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and is not meant to indicate that the publicly-traded Company or any particular subsidiary of the Company owns or operates any asset, business or property. The hospitals, operations and businesses described in this filing are owned and operated, and management services provided, by distinct and indirect subsidiaries of Quorum Health Corporation.
 All references within this Annual Report on Form 10-K to our financial statements, financial data and operating data refer to such data on a consolidated and combined basis unless otherwise noted. For a definition of consolidated and combined basis, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations.”
 For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated total net operating revenues of $1.7 billion, loss from operations of $28.4 million, loss before income taxes of $160.8 million, net loss of $161.9 million, net cash used in operating activities of $32.9 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $96.2 million and Same-facility Adjusted EBITDA of $128.5 million. For information regarding why the we believe Adjusted EBITDA and Same-facility Adjusted EBITDA present useful information to investors and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Same-facility Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure under United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”), see “Item 6 — Selected Financial Data.” Our loss before income taxes was impacted by: (1) $42.8 million of impairment related to our hospital operations business; (2) $24.9 million of net operating losses related to the closure of one hospital; (3) $19.4 million of net operating losses from the hospitals that we divested, which collectively includes three hospitals divested in 2019, three hospitals divested in 2018, five hospitals divested in 2017 and two hospitals divested in 2016; and (4) $132.4 million of interest expense and $111.4 million of cash interest payments made on our indebtedness. 
 Bankruptcy Filing
 On April 7, 2020, Quorum Health Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) with the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) in order to implement the financial restructuring of the Company. The Debtors have requested that the Bankruptcy Court administer the Chapter 11 Cases jointly under the caption In re Quorum Health Corporation, et al.
 The Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. As debtors-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Further, the Debtors have filed a variety of “first day” motions with the Bankruptcy Court requesting permission to continue the Company’s business activities in the ordinary course. For example, the “first day” motions request that the Bankruptcy Court authorize us to perform the following activities, among others: (i) pay employees’ wages and related obligations; (ii) continue to operate our cash management system in a form substantially similar to prepetition practice; (iii) use cash collateral on an interim basis; (iv) continue to pay vendors and suppliers in the ordinary course; (v) pay taxes in the ordinary course; 
 1

(vi) continue to pay or honor certain prepetition claims of physician-owned clinics; (vii) continue to honor certain prepetition refund payments; and (viii) maintain our insurance policies in the ordinary course. The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing to consider the Debtors’ “first day” motions on April 9, 2020. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet entered orders approving the “first day” relief sought by the Debtors, but we expect the Bankruptcy Court to do so and allow us to continue to operate our business in the ordinary course.
 Our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under our debt agreements. Specifically, the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default under (a) the Credit Agreement, among us, the lenders party thereto and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, with respect to the Senior Credit Facility; (b) the ABL Credit Agreement, among us, the lenders party thereto and UBS AG, Stamford Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, with respect to the ABL Credit Facility; and (c) the Indenture, dated as of April 22, 2016, by and between us and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as successor trustee to Regions Bank, with respect to the Senior Notes. Due to the Chapter 11 Cases, however, the lenders’ ability to exercise remedies under their respective credit agreements and debt instruments was stayed as of the date of the Chapter 11 petition and continues to be stayed.
 On April 6, 2020, the Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with (i) the lenders who (a) constitute more than a majority in number of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility and (b) hold at least two-thirds of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Credit Facility (the “Consenting First Lien Lenders”), and (ii) the holders who (x) constitute a majority in number of the holders of the Senior Notes and (y) hold at least two-thirds of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes (the “Consenting Noteholders”, and collectively with the Consenting First Lien Lenders, the “Consenting Stakeholders”). The RSA contemplates that the restructuring and recapitalization of the Debtors will occur through a joint prepackaged plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases (the “Plan”).
 The Debtors filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court on April 7, 2020. Under the RSA, we must seek to have the Plan confirmed and declared effective no later than June 21, 2020, provided that if any required regulatory approval has not been obtained prior to June 21, 2020, then we automatically have an additional twenty calendar days to obtain a confirmed and effective Plan. The Debtors commenced the solicitation process for the acceptance or rejection of the Plan on April 6, 2020, as required by the RSA. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a majority in number and two-thirds in amount of each impaired class of claims must approve the Plan before the Bankruptcy Court will confirm it. The RSA requires the Consenting Stakeholders to vote in favor of and support the Plan, and the Consenting Stakeholders represent the requisite number of votes in each impaired class of creditors entitled to vote on the Plan. Thus, the Debtors anticipate that they will be able to obtain the necessary number of votes to confirm the Plan in the Chapter 11 Cases.
 The Plan provides that the reorganized QHC (the “Reorganized QHC”) will pay all of the general unsecured claims against the Debtors’ estate in the ordinary course of business. Moreover, the Plan will allow us to reduce our debt by approximately $500 million through the refinancing and paydown of our Senior Credit Facility, the refinancing of our ABL Credit Facility and the extinguishment of our Senior Notes. In exchange for the extinguishment of their claims under the Senior Notes, the Reorganized QHC will issue to the holders of the Senior Notes 100% of the shares of new common stock of the Reorganized QHC, subject to dilution for certain issuances of new common stock. The holders of Senior Notes also will receive interests in a litigation trust established by QHC in the Chapter 11 Cases. The Plan requires, and we expect, that all of our existing shares of common stock, restricted stock, and restricted stock units will be cancelled in the Chapter 11 Cases without receiving any distributions from the Debtors. We expect to fund the distributions under the Plan through cash on hand, shares of new common stock of the Reorganized QHC, certain exit financing arrangements, and an equity raise of at least $200 million pursuant to that certain Equity Commitment Agreement, among us and certain of the Consenting Noteholders (the “Equity Commitment Agreement”).
 We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of our Chapter 11 Cases at this time. For the duration of the Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business strategies are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings described in “Item 1A–Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of these risks and uncertainties, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly different following the conclusion of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the description of our properties and capital structure included in this Annual Report may not accurately reflect our properties and capital structure following the Chapter 11 Cases.
 In connection with the announcement of our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) suspended the trading of our shares of common stock on April 7, 2020 and determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE. Our common stock has commenced trading on the OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol “QHCCQ.”
 Additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases is available on the Internet at https://www.QuorumForward.com.
 Going Concern
 Our financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. In an effort to achieve liquidity that would be sufficient to meet all of our commitments, we have undertaken a number of actions, including divesting underperforming hospitals, negotiating with our creditors and stakeholders, and reducing recurring expenses. However, we believe that even after taking these actions, we will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of our future financial obligations, comply with our debt covenants, and execute our business plan. As a result, we filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 7, 2020. The risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, the events of default under our 
 2

credit agreements and the indenture governing our Senior Notes, and the other conditions impacting our business raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are likely to be materially adversely affected, particularly if the pandemic persists for a significant amount of time.
 From an operational perspective, we are focused on providing the safest possible environment for our employees, physicians and other caregivers, and for the care of our patients, while safeguarding patient information. We are working with federal, state and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases in the communities we serve and are taking or supporting measures to try to limit the spread of the virus and to mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. Although we are implementing considerable safety measures, as a front line provider of healthcare services, we are deeply exposed to the health and economic effects of COVID-19, many of which will have a material adverse impact on our employees, as well as our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows that we are not currently able to fully quantify. For example, in 2020, we had to furlough certain employees due to the lack of volume at our hospitals, and these furloughs may persist for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are reassigning hospital personnel with pre-existing conditions or restrictions that make them especially vulnerable to COVID-19 where possible, while some are self-quarantining and not available to work at our facilities during this time. We have also instituted a work-from-home policy for certain of our corporate and administrative offices. Even with such steps, exposure to COVID-19 patients has increased risks to our physicians, nurses and other medical staff, which may further reduce our operating capacity. All of these actions could result in reduced employee morale, labor unrest, work stoppages or other workforce disruptions.
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of elective surgeries, physician office visits and emergency room volumes at our facilities due to restrictive measures, like quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and general concerns related to the risk of contracting COVID-19 from interacting with the healthcare system. We believe that certain of these patient volume declines reflect a deferral of healthcare services utilization to a later period, rather than a permanent reduction in demand for our services. Given the general necessity of the healthcare services we provide, we anticipate that this deferral of services may create a backlog of demand in the future, in addition to the resumption of historically normal activity; however, there is no assurance that either will occur. In addition, while the hospitals that we operate in a wide range of geographies have not experienced major capacity constraints to date, other hospitals in areas that are centers of the COVID-19 outbreak have been overwhelmed, experiencing excessive demand, potentially preventing them from treating all patients who seek care. Despite considerable efforts to source vital supplies, we are also experiencing supply chain disruptions, including shortages, delays and significant price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment (“PPE”). Staffing, equipment, and pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may also impact our ability to admit and treat patients.
 We may also require an increased level of working capital if we experience extended billing and collection cycles as a result of displaced employees, payors, revenue cycle management contractors, or otherwise. Broad economic factors resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including increasing unemployment rates and reduced consumer spending, also affect our service mix, revenue mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and layoffs in the areas we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, requiring an increased level of working capital. If general economic conditions continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected. 
 In addition, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by federal or state laws, regulations, orders, or other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S. healthcare system, which, if adopted, could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may also be subject to lawsuits from patients, employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities. Such actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs, though there is no certainty at this time whether any such lawsuits will be filed or the outcome of such lawsuits if filed. Our professional and general liability insurance may not cover all claims against us.

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act is an approximate $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package passed in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The CARES Act includes broad sweeping provisions including direct financial assistance to Americans in the form of one-time payments to individuals; aid to small businesses in the form of loans and grants; efforts to stabilize the U.S. economy and keep Americans employed in general; and support for healthcare professionals, patients and hospitals. We may have access to potential additional sources of liquidity through funding that may be available to healthcare providers under the CARES Act. The CARES Act includes provisions providing flexibility and financial resources to healthcare providers during this public health emergency. The CARES Act provides funding to support public entities, Medicare or Medicaid enrolled suppliers and providers, and for-profit and not-for-profit entities specified by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that provide diagnoses, testing, or care for COVID-19 patients. The funding, to be included in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund that is administered by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, is intended to reimburse providers for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. The CARES Act also provides funding to support rural critical access hospitals. Also included in the CARES Act are numerous income tax provisions including changes to the Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) rules and the business interest expense deduction rules under Code Section 163(j). Factors that could affect our ability to receive funding include our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the finalization of regulations under the CARES Act, among other factors. Due to the recent enactment of this legislation, there is a high degree of uncertainty around its implementation and we continue to assess the potential impacts of this legislation on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will receive any funding under the CARES Act.
 Effects from the COVID-19 pandemic began in the middle of the first quarter of 2020; therefore, there was no impact to our 2019 results of operations, financial condition and cash flows discussed in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Hospital Operations Business
 Our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and acute inpatient and outpatient healthcare services to patients living in or traveling to the communities in which we are located. Our hospital services include general and acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, diagnostic services, obstetrics, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. Our outpatient healthcare services are provided at both our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities, including physician practices, urgent care centers, imaging centers and surgery centers. We also generate other non-patient revenues, primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales. 
 We prioritize building and maintaining a strong presence in the communities where we operate. We continuously seek to improve our market share in each community by building patient loyalty to both our hospitals and physicians and by maintaining a strong reputation for quality of patient care. We are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services in 19 of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, which means we typically have less direct competition from other hospital companies for our hospital services. Some of our hospitals are located in markets that are adjacent to highly populated areas where the population, available workforce and demand for healthcare services are likely to continue to grow. Such factors could increase the demand for healthcare services from our facilities due to the close proximity of our hospitals and outpatient services facilities to these neighboring markets.
 Each of our hospitals has a corporate board of directors, a board of trustees, or both (in all cases, the “hospital board”), which include members from the local community and the hospital’s medical staff. The hospital board oversees the operations of the hospital and is responsible for matters such as establishing and monitoring policies related to medical, professional and ethical practices at the hospital and also ensuring these practices conform to U.S. healthcare industry standards and regulatory requirements. Each of our hospitals has an active quality assurance program to monitor patient safety and quality of care standards at the hospital and its affiliated outpatient service facilities and to meet accreditation and other federal and state regulatory requirements. Our hospitals conduct patient satisfaction surveys and engage in other quality of care assessment activities that are reviewed and monitored by our senior and hospital management teams on a continuing basis as part of our initiatives to maintain a high-quality reputation in each of the communities we serve.
 Our Hospital Management Advisory and Healthcare Consulting Services Business
 In addition to the healthcare services provided through our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities, we also operate QHR, a leader in hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services. QHR is a leading provider of hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services in the United States. The clients of QHR are hospitals that are not affiliated with our hospital operations business that enter into contracts with us to receive these non-patient services. By managing and consulting with non-affiliated hospitals that are often located in similar markets as our owned and leased hospitals, we hope to benefit from the opportunity to build relationships and partnerships in these communities and to enhance our knowledge of overall U.S. market conditions beyond the markets in which we currently operate hospitals.

QHR’s primary services include:
  
• | Hospital Management Advisory and Operational Support. QHR provides hospital and other healthcare organization clients with operational, financial and strategic guidance, as well as interim senior level management when needed. As of December 31, 2019, QHR had contracts to provide management advisory services to 64 hospital clients located in 26 states with a total of approximately 3,300 licensed beds. As part of the services we provide, our hospital clients receive operations support from QHR corporate and regional management teams. This service benefits our hospital clients as a result of the broader experience of our QHR corporate and regional management teams in providing services to hospitals of all sizes in diverse markets throughout the United States. In addition, QHR promotes healthcare consulting services to hospital clients that do not receive services from its management advisory services business. QHR generates revenues from its consulting contracts by charging a consulting fee for its services based on the nature, scope and timeline of the services defined for each specific contract. During the year ended December 31, 2019, QHR had contracts during some or all of the year to provide healthcare consulting and other support services to 110 hospitals and other healthcare related clients located in 37 states with a total of approximately 10,300 licensed beds.

• | Hospital Group Purchasing. QHR offers group purchasing services to hospitals and other healthcare organizations through its Quorum Purchasing Advantage Program. Through this program, hospital and other healthcare organization clients can enter into a contract with QHR to buy discounted medical supplies, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and other products and services from the same group purchasing organization used by us for our hospital operations business. QHR also assists with managing its clients’ supply chain for such purchases when needed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Education Programs. The Quorum Learning Institute educates healthcare leaders, professionals and other medical staff each year, from trustees and senior level management executives to department managers and other staff. It offers programs through national conferences, classroom courses, webinars and online resources. The Quorum Learning Institute programs address current issues in healthcare and provide technical training courses for new and advancing healthcare professionals and medical staff.

Business Strategy
 Our business strategy is to provide high quality patient care to the communities we serve, with a near term focus of increasing the effectiveness of our revenue cycle functions, reducing our debt, and refining our service lines to address the needs of the markets that we represent. We intend to grow our revenues and operating margins by expanding specialty care and outpatient service lines at our hospitals, primarily by recruiting talented physicians and medical staff. We continuously aim to manage our operating costs, primarily through the efficient management of staffing, medical specialist costs and medical supply inventory levels, with a continued focus on enhancing patient safety and quality of care. In addition, our business strategy includes investing capital in renovations, expansion, medical-related technology and equipment at our existing healthcare facilities. As part of our efforts to accomplish these goals, we operate our healthcare facilities in accordance with the following strategic objectives:

• | strategically expand the breadth and capacity of the specialty care service lines and outpatient services we offer;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhance patient safety, quality of care and satisfaction at our healthcare facilities; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the operating and financial performance of our hospital and clinical operations business, including partnering with industry leaders such as our selection of R1 RCM.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategically Expand the Breadth and Capacity of the Specialty Care Service Lines and Outpatient Services We Offer
 Each of our markets has unique healthcare needs and gaps in available specialty care service lines and we assess these needs on an ongoing basis to prioritize our recruitment efforts. We are focused on the execution of effective primary care and specialty care physician retention and recruitment programs, and additionally non-physician recruitment and retention programs, at each of our hospitals for the purpose of building and maintaining the confidence of community residents in the stability and breadth of medical treatment available to them locally through our healthcare facilities. We invest capital in new and existing specialty care service lines and medical technology at our hospitals to continuously improve and enhance the quality of care experienced by our patients and with the intent of reducing the potential migration of our patients and local community residents to competing in-market and out-of-market providers. We also invest capital to expand our outpatient service line offerings. We believe this widens the catchment area for our hospitals and is consistent with prevailing market drivers in the U.S. healthcare industry, including patient preference for a convenient medical treatment facility, physician preference toward the increased efficiency of utilizing non-hospital settings when available, and both patient and third-party payor preferences toward the typically lower cost of care in outpatient settings.
Enhance Patient Safety, Quality of Care and Satisfaction at our Healthcare Facilities
 Clinical quality is a high priority for us. We have various programs that support our hospitals and outpatient service facilities to continuously improve the safety, quality of care and satisfaction of patients receiving services from us. As an example, we maintain active safety and quality training programs for our senior hospital management, chief nursing officers, quality control directors, physicians and other medical staff at our healthcare facilities. We also have programs that focus on sharing information among our hospital management teams to align best practices in medical treatment, operations and regulatory compliance. We seek to provide our 
 5

hospitals with the infrastructure and technological capability to deliver high-quality care to patients. We believe measurements of patient, physician, medical staff and employee satisfaction provide important insight for our hospital leadership teams into the quality of care being administered to patients. Each of our hospitals has a hospital board that oversees the operations of the hospital and is responsible for matters such as establishing and monitoring policies related to medical, professional and ethical practices at the hospital and also ensuring these practices conform to U.S. healthcare industry standards and regulatory requirements. In addition, each of our hospitals conducts patient, physician, medical staff and employee satisfaction surveys to identify methods and opportunities for improving patient safety, quality of care and satisfaction. In addition, we have standardized many of our processes for documenting compliance with accreditation requirements and clinical best practices that have positive track records in leading to improved patient experiences at our healthcare facilities. For example, we established a baseline at each of our hospitals in April 2013 for monitoring the Serious Safety Event Rate. As of September 30, 2019, we have reported 81.8% fewer serious safety events in comparison to our baseline in 2013.
 Improve the Operating and Financial Performance of our Hospital and Clinical Operations Business, Including Partnering with Industry Leaders such as our Selection of R1 RCM.
 We intend to improve the operating and financial performance at each of our hospitals and outpatient service facilities through frequent and ongoing evaluation of our operations, focusing on hospital-specific strategic initiatives, growing revenues by expanding specialty care and outpatient service line offerings, controlling operating costs and aligning incentive compensation with operating and financial performance to reward our hospital management teams. In general, we believe our opportunities for improving operating and financial performance are hospital-specific and we intend to develop an operating and marketing strategy tailored to the individual community they serve. Our strategic initiatives and operating cost control efforts include tasks such as continuously focusing on revenue cycle management and collections with our strategic partner R1 RCM, adhering to established protocols related to medical supplies utilization, monitoring medical staffing levels and reducing contract labor usage. We believe these efforts, in combination with other initiatives aimed at improving our operating and financial performance, should lead to improved cash flow generation for us in the future.
 Competition
 The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive. We face competition from other healthcare providers for patients, and we utilize both employee and non-employee physicians at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities. Our non-employee physicians, in most cases, also provide services at healthcare facilities not owned by us. We seek to attract patients to our facilities by maintaining a reputation for high quality of care and patient satisfaction, providing convenient inpatient and outpatient settings for the delivery of healthcare services, and ensuring that we invest in technologically advanced medical equipment. Our ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider. For example, plans with narrow network structures restrict the number of participating in-network provider plans, and plans with tiered network structures impose higher cost-sharing obligations on patients who obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier.
 We are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services in 19 of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital resides, which means we typically have less direct competition for our hospital services. Our hospitals face competition from out-of-market hospitals, including hospitals in urban areas that may have more comprehensive specialty care service lines, more advanced medical equipment and technology, more extensive medical research capabilities and resources or greater access to medical education programs. Patients in the markets where we operate hospitals may travel to out-of-market hospitals to seek medical treatment for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the need for services we do not offer or as a result of a physician referral. Patients who seek medical treatment from an out-of-market hospital may subsequently shift their preferences to that hospital for future healthcare services. We also face competition from other specialty care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that are not affiliated with us. Our hospitals and many of the hospitals with whom we compete engage in physician alignment strategies, which may include employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, and participating in Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”) and, to the extent permitted by law, physician ownership of healthcare facilities. Consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts among payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies implemented by large employer groups and their affiliates may also affect our competitive position.
 In our markets where we are not the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, our primary competitor is generally a not-for-profit hospital. Not-for-profit hospitals are typically owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities that are financially supported by endowments and charitable contributions. Not-for-profit hospitals do not pay income or property taxes and are able to make capital investments without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded healthcare facilities and equipment and to offer more specialized healthcare services than those available at our hospitals. Recent consolidations of not-for-profit hospital entities may intensify competitive pressures.
 The trend toward increasing clinical transparency and value-based purchasing within the U.S. healthcare industry may have an adverse impact on our competitive position and patient admissions volumes in ways that we are unable to predict. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, 
 6

the “Affordable Care Act”), requires hospitals to publish or make available to the public their standard charges for healthcare services. In addition, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publicizes on its Hospital Compare website certain data submitted by hospitals in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, which includes individual hospital performance data related to quality of care measures and patient satisfaction surveys.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 In the rural and mid-sized markets where we operate, we believe we have strengths in our hospital operations that differentiate us from our competitors, including our commitment and ability to respond to the demand for better access to high-quality patient care, improved patient experience through the entire treatment and billing process and continuous improvement in clinical quality. We believe our competitive strengths are summarized as follows:

• | strong presence in the communities we serve;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | geographically diversified hospital portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | track record of continuous improvement in clinical quality, safety and patient experience; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | dedicated and experienced management teams.
--+--------------------------------------------

Strong Presence in the Communities We Serve
 Our hospitals are the sole providers of general and acute hospital healthcare services in most of the markets we serve throughout the United States. These communities rely on our hospitals for access to quality healthcare services, as well as to make a positive societal and economic impact in their regions. Our hospitals are dedicated to providing local employment opportunities, engaging in local sponsorships and offering community health education through lecture programs, health fairs and screening events, among other forms of engagement. We believe that being the sole provider in many of our markets offers a competitive advantage; for example, certain of these hospitals receive more favorable reimbursement treatment by Medicare based on this distinction.
Geographically Diversified Hospital Portfolio
 We have a geographically diversified portfolio, which as of December 31, 2019 included 24 hospitals located across 14 states. Many of our hospitals operate in markets experiencing population growth. We believe our existing hospital portfolio is geographically well-positioned to adapt to ongoing changes in the U.S. healthcare industry and to respond to individual community needs related to healthcare services. 
Track Record of Continuous Improvement in Clinical Quality, Safety and Patient Experience
 We are committed to providing a high-quality and cost-effective healthcare experience for patients in collaboration with our physicians, medical staff and third-party payors. We have continued to focus on reducing our Serious Safety Events across all of our hospitals, and through September 30, 2019 we have seen an 81.8% reduction from our 2013 baseline. Our hospitals continually strive to achieve clinical excellence designations, such as Chest Pain Center accreditation by the Society of Cardiovascular Patient Care and Primary Stroke Center accreditation by The Joint Commission.
Dedicated and Experienced Management Teams
 Our dedicated senior management team has significant public company, general healthcare and hospital operations experience, including a proven track record of improving operational performance, optimizing service lines and integrating hospitals. We believe the breadth of healthcare industry expertise and experience from both our senior management team and the management teams at each of our hospitals will drive our long-term growth.
U.S. Healthcare Industry
 Overview
 According to CMS, total U.S. healthcare expenditures in 2018 grew by 4.6% to approximately $3.6 trillion and are projected to have grown 4.8% in 2019 to approximately $3.8 trillion. The CMS projections, published in February of 2019, indicate that total U.S. healthcare spending will grow at an average annual rate of 5.6% for 2019 through 2027, reaching $6.0 trillion by 2027 and accounting for approximately 19.4% of the total U.S. gross domestic product. CMS expects healthcare spending to be largely influenced by changes in economic conditions and demographics. The CMS projections are typically published once per year and are not updated to reflect interim changes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Hospital care, the category within the U.S. healthcare industry in which we classify our hospital operations business, is the largest category of U.S. healthcare expenditures. The hospital care category is broadly defined to include services provided at acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric healthcare facilities that are owned by the government or investors or that operate as not-for-profit facilities. CMS defines the hospital care category to include all services provided by hospitals to patients. Services include room and board, ancillary charges, services of employed physicians, inpatient pharmacy, hospital-based nursing home, home health care and any other service billed by hospitals in the United States for patient care. In 2019, hospital care expenditures are projected to have grown 
 7

5.1%, amounting to over $1.2 trillion. In 2019, CMS estimated that the hospital services category will amount to nearly $1.3 trillion in 2020 and projects growth in this category at an average of 5.7% annually from 2019 through 2027. According to the American Hospital Association, as of January 2020, there are approximately 5,198 community hospitals in the United States and approximately 1,821 of these hospitals are located in rural communities, which are the primary markets in which we operate hospitals.
 Healthcare Reform
 The healthcare industry in the United States remains subject to continuing regulatory and market uncertainty due to recent reforms and reform proposals. The current presidential administration and certain members of Congress have sought to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act. In addition, governmental agencies and courts have narrowed the scope of the law’s reforms through subsequent interpretation. Courts and government agencies could eliminate provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are beneficial to us and leave in effect provisions that reduce our reimbursement. In addition, government and private payors’ efforts to fundamentally change the finance and delivery of health care may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. For example, certain members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage of healthcare expenses, including single-payor proposals. Other industry groups, such as large employers and private payors and their affiliates, have also proposed reforms to the structure of private health insurance. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of healthcare reform, including the Affordable Care Act, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. Although the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, it has emphasized the importance of hospitals and front line service providers.
Demographic Trends 
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2016, the U.S. population included approximately 49.2 million people living in the United States age 65 or older, comprising 15.2% of the total U.S. population. By 2035, the U.S. Census Bureau predicts the number of people age 65 or older living in the United States will increase to approximately 78.0 million, or 21.4% of the total U.S. population. Due to increasing life expectancy, people living in the United States age 85 or older is also expected to increase from approximately 6.4 million in 2016 to 11.8 million by 2035. The increase in life expectancy is expected to increase the demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for more innovative means of delivering healthcare services.
 The following tables set forth certain information with respect to the demographics within our service area based on U.S. Census Bureau data compiled by us for the specific markets in which we operate hospitals:
  
 | Living in our Service Areas | | | Living in the United States
------------------------+-----------------------------+------+----+----------------------------
 | % Change from | | | % Change from | | % Change from | % Change from | 
 | 2010 to 2019 | | | 2019 to 2024 | | 2010 to 2019 | 2019 to 2024 | 
Total number of people | | (0.8 | )% | | 0.5 | % | 6.6 | % | 3.8 | %

People aged 85 or older | | 2.1 | % | | 2.2 | % | 2.1 | % | 2.2 | %

Hospital Consolidation Trends
 Various sectors of the U.S. healthcare industry are experiencing consolidation activity. We believe that consolidation activity in the hospital care category will continue to be a trend of the U.S. healthcare industry in the future. Reasons for this consolidation activity generally include the following:

• | desire to enhance the quality of care and breadth of local healthcare service lines available in communities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | need for additional recruitment of specialty care and primary care physicians or other medical staff;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general economies of scale, such as those that can be achieved through contracting for medical and drug supply purchase agreements and professional and general liability insurance coverage as a combined hospital system;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing market share in the communities they serve;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | mitigating risks associated with ongoing changes in reimbursement rates available from both governmental and non-governmental third-party payors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8

 
• | changes to healthcare reimbursement payment models that more closely tie reimbursement rates to the cost-effective delivery of patient services and the quality of care administered to patients; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other ongoing regulatory changes within the U.S. healthcare industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hospital companies are acquiring an increasing number of physician practices and other outpatient service facilities as part of their physician alignment strategies to position themselves for reduction of readmissions, payment bundling and other payment restructuring models. Similarly, commercial and non-governmental managed care third-party payors have been consolidating and, in some cases, acquiring complementary service providers in an effort to offer more competitive programs.
 Payment Trends
 In recent years, the Affordable Care Act and the consolidation activity within the U.S. healthcare industry, among other factors, have resulted in higher deductible and co-payment requirements due from patients, which in turn have increased financial risk for hospitals. The amount of uncollectible patient account balances is expected to increase in response to rising medical prices and to greater financial burden on insured patients. These increases have been partially offset by the reduction in costs associated with previously uninsured patients benefiting from Medicaid expansion due to the Affordable Care Act. However, it is unclear whether these effects will continue due to uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act and other health reform initiatives. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of our payment trends will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
Outpatient Services Trends
 In recent years, hospital companies have generally experienced an increase in the percentage of total revenues associated with outpatient healthcare services. This shift in revenues is primarily attributable to advances in medical technology, which have permitted more procedures to be performed in an outpatient setting. In addition, increased pressure from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, commercial health insurance companies and managed care plans to reduce the number of days a patient stays in the hospital has also contributed to the increase in outpatient healthcare services. Patients and third-party payors have been seeking lower cost service settings through outpatient service facilities on an increasing basis as the number of outpatient service facilities and the types of services available through outpatient service facilities increase. Certain third-party payors are imposing limitations and adjusting coverage of inpatient services for types of services currently available in outpatient settings. Further, recent changes to Medicare policy affecting the reimbursement methodology for certain items and services provided by off-campus provider-based hospital departments have generally resulted in reduced payment rates for hospital outpatient settings. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, outpatient healthcare services represented 57.3%, 55.9% and 55.0%, respectively, of our net patient revenues, before any implicit price concessions.
Health Insurance Coverage Trends
 The Affordable Care Act, as initially structured, mandated that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. In recent years, most of the states that have experienced the greatest reductions in rates of uninsured individuals have been those that expanded Medicaid coverage and established healthcare insurance exchanges at the state level. However, CMS has indicated that it intends to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including allowing states to condition Medicaid enrollment on work or other community engagement. Further, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act, making it difficult to predict future trends in health insurance coverage. The presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation. In 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may impact the number of individuals who elect to purchase health insurance. In addition, the President signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain health plans, potentially allowing for fewer plans that adhere to specific Affordable Care Act coverage mandates. Several private health insurers have limited their participation in or withdrawn from the healthcare insurance exchanges, and the presidential administration has taken steps, including ending cost-sharing subsidies that were previously available to insurers, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces. Government efforts to change, alter the implementation of, or repeal the Affordable Care Act, or otherwise influence financial and delivery systems within the healthcare industry, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, capital resources and liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of health insurance coverage trends will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
Revenues
 We generate revenues by providing healthcare services at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities to patients seeking medical treatment. Hospital revenues depend on, among other factors, inpatient occupancy and acuity levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges and negotiated reimbursement rates for the healthcare services provided. Our primary sources of payment for patient healthcare services are third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs, commercial insurance companies, other managed care programs, workers’ compensation carriers 
 9

and employers. Self-pay revenues are the portion of our revenues generated from providing healthcare services to patients who do not have health insurance coverage, as well as the patient responsibility portion of charges that are not covered for an individual by a health insurance program or plan. We generate revenues related to our QHR business when hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services are provided. We generate other non-patient revenues primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.
 Amounts we collect for medical treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental third-party payors are generally less than our standard billing rates. Our standard charges and reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of medical procedure performed and the geographical location of the hospital. Differences in our standard billing rates and the amounts we expect to collect from third-party payors are classified as contractual adjustments. The reimbursements we ultimately receive as payments for services are determined for each patient instance of care, based on the contractual terms we negotiate with third-party payors or based on federal and state regulations related to governmental healthcare programs. Except for emergency department services, our policy is to determine the payment methodology with patients prior to when the services are performed. Self-pay and other payor discounts are incentives offered to uninsured or underinsured patients or other payors to reduce their costs of healthcare services. Billings and collections were outsourced to CHS under a TSA that was entered into with CHS in connection with the Spin-off through September 30, 2019. See Note 16 — Related Party Transactions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on these agreements. On May 8, 2019, we entered into an agreement with R1 RCM to receive end-to-end revenue cycle management services. The agreement with R1 RCM has, among other things, allowed for us to transition our billing and collection services from CHS to R1 RCM. In July 2019, R1 RCM began providing limited services to us, such as status review on aged accounts receivable and insurance denials. Effective October 1, 2019, we transitioned our billing and collection services from CHS to R1 RCM.
 The following table provides a summary of our net operating revenues by payor source (dollars in thousands):
  
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
--------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 
 | $ Amount | | % of Total | | $ Amount | | % of Total | $ Amount | | | % of Total | 
Medicare | $ | 480,475 | | 28.4 | % | $ | 532,097 | | 28.3 | % | | $ | 613,846 | 29.6 | %
Medicaid | | 351,297 | | 20.8 | % | | 352,111 | | 18.7 | % | | | 417,656 | 20.2 | %

 Revenues from Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs are included in Medicare and Medicaid revenues, respectively, in the table above. In addition, the table above includes a $21.0 million change in estimate we recorded as of December 31, 2017. The $21.0 million change in estimate was a result of our analysis of our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and the refinement of our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our divested hospitals. 
 Reimbursement under Governmental Healthcare Programs
 We receive payments for a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare managed care plans, known as Medicare Advantage Plans, and the Medicaid managed care plans. Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance benefits to individuals age 65 and older, some disabled individuals and individuals with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal and state funded program, administered at the state level, which provides health insurance benefits and subsidies to certain individuals who are unable to pay for healthcare services or health insurance on their own. All of our hospitals are certified as providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 The payments we receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than the standard charges at our hospitals for the healthcare services provided. Furthermore, reimbursement payments under federally-funded healthcare programs are subject to across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. These sequestration cuts, as they are known, require reductions in reimbursement rates through federal fiscal year 2027. The Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, also imposes significant reductions on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. The federal government updates reimbursement rates annually. Legislation or regulation may result in payment reductions in the Medicare or Medicaid programs that could negatively impact our business. Our ability to adapt to the ongoing regulatory changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs will be a significant factor in our ability to operate our hospitals and affiliated outpatient healthcare facilities successfully in the future. See “Item 1. Business — U.S. Healthcare Industry” for statistical information on U.S. population trends. In addition, see “Item 1. Business — COVID-19 Pandemic” for information related to the CARES Act and the potential impact in 2020 on our reimbursement under governmental healthcare programs. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future 
 10

of our reimbursement under governmental healthcare programs will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
 Medicare Reimbursement
 Under the Medicare program, we are paid for inpatient and outpatient healthcare services provided to qualifying Medicare beneficiaries at our hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Medicare is funded by the federal government under a series of individual programs. For example, the Part A program covers hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice care services and the Part B program covers physician services, preventive care, durable medical equipment, hospital outpatient services, laboratory tests, x-rays, mental health care and some home health and ambulance services. Medicare Advantage Plans, which is the customary term for the Part C program, are administered by private third-party payors that contract with the Medicare program to provide Medicare Part A and Part B benefits to participants. They include plans organized as health management organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), private fee-for-service plans, special needs plans and Medicare medical savings account plans. We are paid directly by the third-party payor that administers a Medicare Advantage Plan for the healthcare services we provide to patients enrolled in one of these plans. The regulations governing reimbursement under the Medicare program also generally apply to Medicare Advantage Plans. See “Item 1. Business — COVID-19 Pandemic” for information related to the CARES Act and the potential impact on our 2020 Medicare reimbursement.
 Inpatient Medicare Reimbursement. Reimbursement rates for inpatient acute care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are generally determined based on a prospective payment system. Under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”), our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount based on the patient’s diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a medical severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”) based upon the patient’s course of medical treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. The base MS-DRG payment rate does not consider the actual costs incurred by an individual hospital in providing a particular inpatient service. Each MS-DRG is assigned a relative weight that reflects the average amount of resources, as determined on a national basis, that are needed to treat a patient with that particular diagnosis compared to the amount of hospital resources that are needed to treat the average Medicare inpatient stay. The IPPS payment for each discharge is based on two national standardized base payment rates, one that covers hospital operating expenses and the other that covers hospital capital costs. The base MS-DRG payment rate for operating expenses is adjusted by a wage index to reflect geographical differences in labor costs. While a hospital generally does not receive additional reimbursement beyond the MS-DRG payment, hospitals may qualify for an “outlier” payment when a patient’s medical treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold.
 CMS adjusts the MS-DRG payment rates annually, using the “market basket index” to account for changes to the costs of goods and services purchased by hospitals. For federal fiscal year 2020, which began on October 1, 2019, CMS increased the reimbursement rate by approximately 3.1% for hospitals that successfully report the quality measures of the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (“IQR”) Program and are meaningful EHR users. This rate increase accounts for a projected market basket update of 3.0% and a 0.5% adjustment required by legislation which was negatively adjusted by 0.4 for the multi-factor productivity measure. Hospitals that do not successfully report quality data under the IQR Program are subject to a 25% reduction of the market basket update. Hospitals that are not meaningful EHR users are subject to an additional 75% reduction of the market basket update. Based on our current portfolio, we estimate that the CMS payment rate changes indicated above will increase our inpatient Medicare reimbursement by $4.6 million in 2020.
 The DRG payment rates are also adjusted pursuant to provisions of the Affordable Care Act that promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. For example, hospitals that meet or exceed defined quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement, while hospitals that do not satisfy the quality performance standards may receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. The amount collected from the reductions is pooled and used to fund the payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical processes of care and patient satisfaction. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and improvement relative to that hospital’s own past performance. Similarly, hospitals that experience “excess readmissions” for conditions designated by CMS within 30 days of the patient’s date of discharge receive inpatient payments reduced by an amount determined by comparing that hospital’s readmission performance to the readmission performance of hospitals in one of five peer groups. In addition, CMS incentivizes hospitals to improve Hospital Acquired Condition (“HAC”) rates by reducing total inpatient Medicare payments by 1% for hospitals that rank among the lowest-performing 25% with respect to HACs. 
 Outpatient Medicare Reimbursement. CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients without Part A coverage) under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (“OPPS”). Other items and services, such as physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, and clinical diagnostic laboratory services, are reimbursed pursuant to fee schedules.
 Hospital outpatient services paid under the OPPS are grouped into ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. CMS has established a payment rate for each APC, and it updates these rates annually on a calendar year basis. For calendar year 2020, CMS issued a final rule that it estimates will result in a 2.6% payment increase for hospitals paid under the OPPS. This reflects a market basket increase of 3.0%, with a negative 0.4 percentage point multi-factor productivity adjustment, along with other policy changes. For calendar year 2020, these policy changes 
 11

include an update to ASC payment rates to be based on the hospital market basket rate as opposed to the CPI-U for calendar years 2019-2023. CMS also is updating ASC rates for calendar year 2020 by 2.6%. This change will help promote site neutrality between hospitals and ASCs. In addition to these broad OPPS-wide adjustments, hospitals that fail to meet quality data reporting requirements are subject to a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. Based on our current portfolio, we estimate that the cumulative changes to OPPS payments will increase our outpatient Medicare reimbursement by $1.1 million in 2020.
 CMS has implemented a site-neutral Medicare reimbursement policy that limits reimbursement under the OPPS for items and services that are provided at certain off-campus outpatient provider-based departments (“off-campus OPBDs”) of hospitals. Items and services that are subject to the policy are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). However, the site-neutral payment policy does not apply to items and services rendered in a dedicated emergency department. Further, with the exception of clinic visits, the site neutral policy does not apply to items or services furnished at off-campus OPBDs that are located within 250 yards of a remote location of a hospital, or to grandfathered off-campus OPBDs, which include those that were billing Medicare for outpatient hospital services prior to November 2, 2015.
 Medicare Bundled Payments. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, which is part of CMS, works to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare services that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while maintaining or improving quality of care. Some of the current and proposed initiatives involve bundled payments, which link payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode of care. Generally, providers participating in a bundled payment arrangement agree to receive one payment for services provided to patients for certain medical conditions or during each episode of care. In contrast to the traditional fee-for-service model, bundled payments are intended to align incentives for providers, encouraging more effective and efficient care.
 Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but CMS requires hospitals located in certain geographic areas to participate in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (“CJR”) model, a mandatory bundled payment initiative focused on knee and hip replacements. We operate one hospital within the geographical areas currently being tested. CMS has indicated that it is developing more bundled payment models. Our experience to date with the CJR model has not materially impacted our overall financial statements.
 Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program. The Medicare program also makes reimbursement rate adjustments under a Medicare-Dependent Hospital program that applies to low admission volume hospitals, referred to as rural extenders, to ensure hospital access for rural Medicare beneficiaries. The budget bill signed into law in February 2018 extended the Medicare-Dependent Hospital program through federal fiscal year 2022.
 Medicare Physician Services Payments. Physician services provided to Medicare patients are reimbursed based on the MPFS, which is adjusted annually based on certain factors. Under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), one of those factors is an adjustment factor of 0.5%. MACRA also established the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other healthcare clinicians are required to participate in the QPP through one of two tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in 2017 will affect Medicare payments in 2019 and performance data collected in 2018 will affect payments in 2020. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS, such as certain ACO models or a Medicare Shared Savings Program. Providers may earn a 5% Medicare incentive payment between 2019 and 2024 and will be exempt from reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) if the provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track. Providers who choose the MIPS track initially will be subject to a performance-based reimbursement rate increase or decrease of up to 4% of the provider’s Medicare payments based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities and meaningful use of EHR. The adjustment percentage will increase incrementally, up to 9%, by 2022. MIPS consolidated components of three previously established incentive programs: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier, and the Medicare EHR Incentive Program.
 Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments. In addition to making payments related to specific patient services, Medicare provides financial support to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients. These Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payments are determined annually based on statistical information required by the HHS and are paid as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments. The Affordable Care Act reduced Medicare DSH payments to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would have been paid is earmarked for an uncompensated care payment pool that is adjusted each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the U.S. uninsured population that is under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the rate of coverage for the previously uninsured population, the more the Medicare uncompensated care pool will be reduced. Each eligible hospital is then paid, out of the uncompensated care pool, an amount based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. The IPPS final rules for federal fiscal years 2020 and 2019 established the uncompensated care amounts to be distributed to qualifying hospitals in these years as nearly $8.4 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. Medicare DSH payments received in the aggregate by our hospitals for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $9.9 million, $10.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively. We estimate the amount to be received for 2020 to be approximately $9.1 million. The passing of the CARES Act in March 2020 removed the sequestration reduction related to Medicare settlements from May 
 12

2020 through December 2020. We estimate the additional amount to be received by our hospitals during that period to be approximately $3.0 million.
 Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) in 12 defined jurisdictions. Each MAC is geographically assigned and serves both Medicare Part A and Part B providers within its given jurisdiction. In connection with past consolidation efforts, CMS gave chain providers the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC. Although we elected to use one MAC, CMS has not yet transitioned all of our hospitals to one MAC and has not provided a clear timeline for doing so. MAC transitions impact Medicare claims processing, which could delay reimbursement payments and adversely affect our cash flows. MAC transitions may also be prompted by the periodic re-soliciting by CMS of MAC bids in a jurisdiction.
Medicaid Reimbursement
 Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states to provide healthcare benefits to certain low-income individuals. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a prospective payment system or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Amounts received under the Medicaid programs are often significantly less than the hospital’s standard charges for the services provided. State Medicaid agencies may also fund Medicaid Managed Care Plans, which provide for the delivery of Medicaid health benefits and additional services through contracted arrangements between state Medicaid agencies and managed care organizations (MCOs) that accept a set per member per month payment for these services. We are paid directly by the MCO for the healthcare services we provide to patients enrolled in one of these plans. The regulations that govern the reimbursement rates of the Medicaid programs also generally apply to Medicaid managed care plans.
 The Affordable Care Act requires states to expand Medicaid coverage by adjusting eligibility requirements such as income thresholds. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. Eight of the 14 states in which we operate hospitals have expanded coverage under their state Medicaid programs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities located in these eight states generated 81.6% of our total net patient revenues, before implicit price concessions, excluding our divested hospitals and affiliated outpatient services facilities. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act, including its Medicaid expansion provisions. In addition, budget pressures have prompted many states to consider reducing Medicaid funding, as Medicaid is often the state’s largest program. Some states have adopted or are considering legislation intended to reduce coverage, increase enrollment in managed care programs or otherwise finance the system. Several states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. CMS has indicated that it intends to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including approving waivers that allow states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement. However, the Affordable Care Act, as enacted, required that states maintain certain eligibility standards for children at the same levels that were in place as of March 23, 2010, until October 1, 2019. These eligibility standards were extended through the Healthy KIDS Act through September 30, 2023, but after October 1, 2019, the requirement applies only to children in families with incomes at or below 300% of the federal poverty level. Thus, states with eligibility levels above 300% of the federal poverty level have the option to maintain or reduce coverage levels for children to 300% of the federal poverty level. The Affordable Care Act also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to patients to treat hospital acquired conditions. 
 See “Item 1. Business — COVID-19 Pandemic” for information related to the CARES Act and the potential impact on our 2020 Medicaid reimbursement.
 Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital and Supplemental Payments. Currently, most states, including 13 of the 14 states in which we operate, utilize supplemental payment programs, including disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) programs, for the purpose of providing additional payments for services to providers, such as our hospitals, to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and funded with a combination of federal and state resources, including, in certain states, taxes, fees or other program costs (collectively, “provider taxes”) levied on the providers participating in the programs. Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. States then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals, as determined in each state. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. Under the budget bill signed into law in February 2018, Medicaid DSH funding will be reduced by $4 billion in federal fiscal year 2020, which begins on October 1, 2019, and by $8 billion per year in federal fiscal years 2021 through 2025. On December 20, 2019, this reduction was delayed until May 22, 2020; however, the passing of the CARES Act in March 2020 delayed these reductions through December 2020. In addition to DSH payments, some states operate programs that provide for supplemental payments to bridge the gap between hospital operating costs and Medicare reimbursement. Various federal policy changes are focused on limiting the use of other types of supplemental payments. For example, CMS began limiting “pass-through payments” to Medicaid managed care plans in 2016 and will ultimately prohibit such payments by 2027. See “Item 1. Business — COVID-19 Pandemic” for information related to the CARES Act and the potential impact on our 2020 Medicaid disproportionate share hospital and supplemental payments. The extent to which the COVID-19 
 13

pandemic could impact the future of our Medicaid disproportionate share hospital and supplemental payments will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
 We recognize the reimbursement payments due to us from state supplemental payment programs in the periods amounts are estimable and revenue collection is reasonably assured. These amounts are recorded in operating revenues as favorable contractual allowances and the costs we incur under these programs are recorded as other operating expenses.
 The following table shows the portion of our Medicaid reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs (in thousands):

 Several states in which we operate face budgetary challenges that have resulted, and likely will continue to result, in reduced Medicaid funding levels to hospitals and other providers. Continuing pressure on state budgets and other factors could result in future reductions to Medicaid payments, payment delays or additional provider taxes being assessed on hospitals participating in these programs. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our Medicaid funding levels will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
 The following table shows the portion of our Medicaid reimbursements by state attributable to state supplemental payment programs (in thousands):

 The California Department of Health Care Services implemented the Hospital Quality Assurance Fee (“HQAF”) program, imposing a fee on certain general and acute care California hospitals. Revenues generated from these fees provide funding for the non-federal supplemental payments to California hospitals that serve California’s Medicaid (“Medi-Cal”) and uninsured patients. Under this program we recognized $17.1 million, $25.9 million and $22.0 million of operating revenues, net of provider taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is included in the table above.
 TRICARE
 TRICARE is the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program for members of the armed forces. Under the TRICARE program, hospitals and other healthcare providers are reimbursed for healthcare services provided to qualifying patients using an inpatient DRG-based payment system and an outpatient prospective payment system similar to those used to make reimbursement payments under the Medicare program.
 Reimbursement under Non-Governmental Plans and Programs
 Managed Care and Commercial Plans 
 In addition to governmental healthcare reimbursement programs, we are paid for a portion of the healthcare services we provide to patients by private third-party payors, including commercial health insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs, other managed care 
 14

companies, workers’ compensation carriers and employers. Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between the standard charges for our services and the contracted payment amounts that we receive from non-government third-party payors, but are responsible for the portions of the payment for services that are not covered by programs or plans under contract. These amounts generally consist of the deductibles and co-payment obligations of their coverage. The deductible and co-payment obligations due from patients, which we include in the self-pay payor category, have increased in recent years in response to the increasing numbers of individuals and employers who purchase insurance plans with high deductibles and high co-payments. 
 Commercial health insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies generally attempt to manage their costs by seeking discounted fee structures or fixed fee charge arrangements with providers to reduce their payouts below the provider’s standard charges or the charges initially billed to them. They also utilize other strategies, such as narrowing the provider options in their networks, to restrict the pool of providers that insured patients may utilize under their coverage. Consolidation within the payor industry, including vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies imposed by large employer groups and their affiliates may increase these challenges. To remain competitive, we actively engage in the negotiation of discounts or fixed fee charge arrangements with commercial health insurance and other private managed care companies. The negotiated discounts and fixed fee charge arrangements are typically less than the reductions in reimbursement rates imposed on us by governmental payors. If an increasing number of private third-party payors succeed in negotiating discounted or fixed fee structures with us or if we are unable to negotiate acceptable contractual terms with these payors and therefore do not participate in some or all of the commercial health insurance and managed care networks in our markets, our results of operations or cash flows may be adversely impacted. 
 Under current law, commercial health insurance companies that participate in the health care exchanges (the “Exchanges”), which were established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, are required to offer a set of minimum coverage benefits and a minimum number of levels of plans that vary depending on the percentage of total premium costs to be paid by the insured individual. Our hospitals participate in the provider networks of various insurers offering plan options on the Exchanges. However, in 2017, the President signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain health plans, potentially permitting the sale of short-term health insurance plans and coverage that does not meet the Affordable Care Act’s minimum requirements. In addition, several insurers have withdrawn from or limited their participation in the Exchanges, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces.
 Accountable Care Organizations
 With the aim of reducing healthcare costs by improving quality and operational efficiency, ACOs are gaining traction in both the public and private sectors of the U.S. healthcare industry. An ACO is a network of providers, including hospitals, physicians and other designated healthcare-related professionals, which work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare services. ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency initiatives. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program that seeks to promote accountability through the creation of ACOs. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion in determining key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. 
The Affordable Care Act
 The Affordable Care Act, as initially structured, mandated that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. However, there is considerable uncertainty with regard to the future of the Affordable Care Act, as the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the law, its implementation and its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Further, in June 2018, the Department of Labor issued a final rule expanding availability of association health plans, which are not required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. This change may result in individuals purchasing less comprehensive coverage. In addition, several private health insurers have withdrawn from or limited their participation in the Exchanges, and the presidential administration has taken steps, including ending cost-sharing subsidies that were previously available to insurers, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces. Further, in December 2019 in Texas v. U.S., 945 F.3d (5th Cir. 2019), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit determined that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate is unconstitutional, and it remanded the case to the District Court to further analyze whether the rest of the Affordable Care Act could survive without the individual mandate. A group of Democratic state officials and the House of Representatives have petitioned the Supreme Court to review the decision, and there continues to be uncertainty about the future of the law. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of the Affordable Care Act will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.

California Hospital Quality Assurance Fee Program
 The HQAF program provides funding for supplemental payments to hospitals that serve Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. Revenues generated from fees assessed on certain general and acute care California hospitals fund the non-federal supplemental payments to California’s safety-net hospitals while drawing down federal matching funds that are issued as supplemental payments to hospitals for care of Medi-Cal patients. In November 2016, California voters approved a state constitutional amendment measure that extends indefinitely the statute that imposes fees on California hospitals seeking federal matching funds.
 The fourth phase of the HQAF program expired on December 31, 2016. The California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) submitted the Phase V HQAF program package to CMS on March 30, 2017 for approval of the overall program structure and the fees or provider tax rates for the program period January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019, and the fee-for-service inpatient and outpatient upper payments limits (“UPL”) for each of the state fiscal years in the period January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019. CMS issued formal approval of Phase V HQAF on December 15, 2017. The approvals included the inpatient and outpatient fee-for-service supplemental payments and the overall tax structure. However, CMS has not yet issued a decision on the managed care components of the Phase V HQAF program and, therefore, the payment amounts in the draft model are not finalized. In addition, the supplemental Medi-Cal managed care payments made through the new directed payment mechanism have been estimated using inpatient utilization data publicly reported to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development for the fiscal year ending in 2015. However, the directed payments will be made for inpatient and outpatient services provided to in-network patients during the current state fiscal year. Phase V of California’s HQAF program expired on June 30, 2019 and the next phase of the program, Phase VI, began July 1, 2019 and is expected to be a 30 month program.
 Of the total supplemental payments received by all hospitals, our portion represents 0.16%. We are estimating that our net impact for Phase VI over the 30-month period, January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, will be $27.6 million. While uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of payments under the HQAF program exist, our estimates of future cash collections at this time, net of any provider taxes, including those related to previous programs, are $2.8 million in 2020 and $0.9 million in 2021. These estimates take into consideration the sale of Watsonville Community Hospital and its affiliated entities (“Watsonville”), which was sold on September 30, 2019. The timeline for Phase VI payments has not been released by the State of California and are not included in our estimates.
 Other Government Laws and Regulations
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been temporary relief for a number of healthcare regulations, including HIPPA regulations to encourage the utilization of telehealth programs as well as state and federal medical licensing requirements typically imposed on healthcare facilities.
Licensure, Certifications and Accreditations
 Hospitals and other healthcare providers are subject to laws and regulations regarding licensing, certification or accreditation, and may be subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local governmental agencies evaluating compliance and performance with such requirements. In addition, healthcare providers participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to extensive regulatory requirements in order to continue to qualify for participation in these programs.
 Regulations imposed on healthcare facilities for licensure, certification and accreditation address compliance areas such as the following:
  
• | the adequacy of medical care, equipment and staff;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | operating policies and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------


• | billing and coding for services, including classifying the acuity level of care provided;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proper handling of reimbursement overpayments;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | preparing and filing of Medicare and Medicaid annual cost reports;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | relationships between referral sources and recipients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining adequate compliance records;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | utilization reviews of services provided at our facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | standard charges for patient services;
--+---------------------------------------


• | compliance with building codes;
--+--------------------------------


• | environmental protection; and
--+------------------------------


• | patient privacy and security.
--+------------------------------

 Failure to comply with applicable licensure, certification, and accreditation standards may result in criminal penalties, civil sanctions, loss of operating licenses, or restrictions on our ability to participate in certain government programs. All of our hospitals 
 16

and other healthcare facilities are currently licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in both federal and state Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 Federal and state governments have enacted various laws intended to prevent and reduce healthcare fraud and abuse, which continue to be a top enforcement priority. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Civil monetary penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 Federal False Claims Act
 The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits knowingly making false claims or statements to the U.S. government, including submitting false claims for reimbursement under government programs. The FCA broadly defines the term “knowingly.” Although simple negligence does not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity may constitute “knowingly” submitting a false claim and result in liability. The FCA can be used to prosecute fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, and submitting false cost reports. Its reach extends to payments involving federal funds in connection with the Exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act. Violations of other statutes, such as the Stark Law and Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can serve as a basis for liability under the FCA.
 Among the potential bases for liability under the FCA are knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and knowingly failing to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding annual cost report is due, whichever is later. Overpayments are deemed to have been “identified” when a provider has, or should have, through reasonable diligence determined that a reimbursement overpayment was received and quantified such overpayment.
 A provider that is determined to be liable under the FCA is required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the federal government, plus a substantial mandatory civil penalty for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. Settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe calculation of damages. The FCA also contains “qui tam” or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to file a complaint or otherwise report actions alleging the defrauding of the federal government by a provider. If the federal government intervenes, the individual that filed the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the federal government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue its allegation independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment. When a private individual brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant generally is not made aware of the lawsuit until the federal government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene.
 Any provider that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid reimbursement payments is required to distribute and make available to all employees, contractors and any other agents detailed information about its policies related to false claims, false statements and whistleblower protection under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws.
 Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“Anti-Kickback Statute”), a subsection of the Social Security Act, makes it a felony to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce patient referrals or business that is reimbursable under any federal healthcare program. Violations under the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in exclusion from federal healthcare programs and the imposition of criminal and civil fines, including the payment of damages up to three times the amount of the remuneration involved. The civil monetary penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. Further, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false claim under the FCA.
 The HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities in federal healthcare programs. As part of its duties, the OIG provides guidance to healthcare providers by identifying types of activities that could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG has published regulations that set forth “safe harbors” protecting certain payment and business practices that are deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. To be protected by a safe harbor, an arrangement must fit squarely in the safe harbor and satisfy all of its requirements. The failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the activity violates the Anti-Kickback Statute; however, such failure may lead to increased scrutiny by the OIG or other governmental enforcement agencies.
 The OIG has identified the following incentive arrangements as presenting a substantial risk of fraud and abuse, and, if the requisite intent is present, could therefore violate the Anti-Kickback Statute:
  
• | payment of any incentive by a hospital to a physician when the physician makes a patient referral to the hospital or to a healthcare facility that benefits the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment to physicians to entice them to locate in close proximity to the hospital;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other medical and administrative staffing services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | provision of free training for a physician or a physician’s medical and office staff, including management and laboratory training, but excluding compliance training;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of guarantees that provide that if a physician’s income falls below a predetermined level, the hospital will pay the remainder to them;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provision of low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans that may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment for services to a physician, in which such services require few, if any, substantive duties to be performed by the physician or that are in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coverage of a physician on the hospital’s group health insurance plan at an inappropriately low cost to the physician;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | purchases from a physician made by a hospital for goods and services at prices in excess of their fair market value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rental of space to physicians at prices below fair market value; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engaging in relationships with physician-owned entities, often referred to as physician-owned distributorships (“PODs”), which derive revenues from the sale or arrangement for sale of implantable medical devices whereby the physician orders such medical devices and then uses them for their own patients in surgeries or procedures performed at the hospital or other outpatient service facility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a variety of financial arrangements with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals. Physicians own interests in some of our facilities. Physicians may also own our stock. We have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases, management agreements and professional service agreements. We provide financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals. These incentives include relocation packages, reimbursement for certain direct expenses, income guarantees and, in some cases, loans. Although we strive to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, taking into account available guidance from the OIG including the “safe harbor” regulations, we cannot make assurances that the OIG or other regulatory agencies may not view a financial arrangement as a potential violation. If that happens, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties or may become excluded from eligibility to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs.
 The Stark Law
 The Social Security Act also includes a physician self-referral law, a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements, unless an exception applies. These types of referrals are commonly known as “self-referrals.” The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid from billing these programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral. “Designated health services” include, among other things, inpatient and outpatient hospital services.
 Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of reimbursement payments under federal healthcare programs, substantial civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Stark Law provides for a penalty of up to $169,153 for engaging in activities intended to circumvent the Stark Law prohibitions. These civil monetary penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self-referral prohibitions under the Stark Law. For example, one exception allows a physician to refer patients to a healthcare entity in which the physician has an ownership interest if such entity is located in a rural area, as defined under the Stark Law. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and healthcare entities, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. From time to time, the federal government has issued regulations that interpret the provisions included in the Stark Law.
 Another Stark Law exception, known as the “whole hospital” exception, allows a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a department of the hospital. A hospital is considered to be physician-owned if any physician, or an immediate family member of a physician, holds stock, debt or other types of investment arrangements in the hospital or in any owner of the hospital, excluding physician ownership through publicly traded securities that meet certain conditions. CMS regulations impose various restrictions and disclosure requirements on physician-owned hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership in writing to patients and must make a list of their physician owners available upon request to the public. Each physician owner who is a member of a physician-owned hospital’s medical staff must agree, as a condition of their inclusion on the medical staff and their admitting privileges at the hospital, to disclose in writing to all patients whom they refer to the hospital their ownership interest, or an immediate family members’ ownership interest, in the hospital. 
 The Affordable Care Act narrowed the “whole hospital” exception to the Stark Law. Although existing physician investments in a whole hospital may continue under a “grandfather” clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, physicians 
 18

are prohibited from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital from the percentage that existed as of March 23, 2010. In addition, the Affordable Care Act restricts the ability of existing physician-owned hospitals to expand the aggregate number of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds beyond that for which the hospital was licensed as of March 23, 2010. If a physician-owned hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could be required to repay Medicare payments related to referrals from its physician investors and possibly lose its Medicare provider agreement and be unable to participate in Medicare. Tracking the required elements of the “whole hospital exception” is critical to maintaining these entities in compliance with the Stark Law.
 Other Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Under various federal laws and regulations, any individual or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a healthcare benefit program, including both governmental and private healthcare programs and plans, may be subject to fines, imprisonment or both. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”) imposes substantial civil penalties on providers that, for example, knowingly present or cause to be presented a claim for services not provided as claimed, offer remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a healthcare provider, or bill Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges. Notably, the CMP Law requires a lower burden of proof than some other fraud and abuse laws. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including engaging in certain gainsharing arrangements or contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal healthcare program. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from federal healthcare programs any investors, officers, and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud, even if those individuals had no knowledge of the fraud.
State Laws
 A number of states, including states in which we operate hospitals, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private individual or entity may file a civil lawsuit in a state court. Federal laws provide an incentive to states to enact false claims laws at the state level that are comparable to the FCA.
 In addition, many states in which we operate have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals. Many states have also passed self-referral legislation similar to the Stark Law, prohibiting the referral of patients to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship. Often these state laws are broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payor for the healthcare services provided. These statutes at the state level typically include criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure, for violations. There is little precedent for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.
 Program Integrity
 CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection efforts to identify improper reimbursement payments. Most non-governmental managed care programs require similar utilization reviews. Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”), for example, are groups of physicians and other healthcare quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for the delivery of healthcare goods and services to Medicare beneficiaries that are considered reasonable and necessary courses of treatment and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Among other responsibilities, QIOs are tasked with conducting short stay inpatient hospital reviews to evaluate compliance with the two midnight rule. Providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with Medicare payment policies may be referred by a QIO to a Recovery Audit Contractor.
 Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with third parties nationwide to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, as required by statute. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. Compensation for RACs is on a contingency basis, based upon the amount of overpayments and underpayments identified, if any. CMS recently reduced the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider’s claim denial rate for the previous year.
 The RAC program’s scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform reviews and post-payment audits of Medicaid claims to identify potential overpayments. MICs are assigned to five geographic jurisdictions within the United States. Besides MICs, other approved contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities of Medicaid payments.
 We maintain policies and procedures to respond to RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2019 was approximately four years. As a result of a federal court ruling in 2018, however, the processing time is being reduced as a federal judge ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to decrease the number of pending Medicare appeals according to a specific schedule by FY 2022.
 19

Annual Cost Reports
 Hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs are required to meet specified financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers can appeal final determinations made in connection with an audit. MS-DRG outlier payments have been and continue to be a subject of CMS audit and adjustment. The OIG is also actively engaged in audits and investigations into alleged abuses of the MS-DRG outlier payment system. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded net favorable (unfavorable) contractual allowance adjustments in net operating revenues of $2.2 million, $(0.3) million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to previous program reimbursement estimates and final cost report settlements.
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) Administrative Simplification provisions and their implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain healthcare claims and transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the U.S. healthcare industry. HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction.
 HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and implementing regulations extensively regulate the use, disclosure, confidentiality, availability and integrity of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and provide for a number of individual rights with respect to such information. These requirements apply to health plans and most health care providers, which are known as “covered entities.” Vendors, known as “business associates,” that handle protected health information, on behalf of covered entities must also comply with most HIPAA requirements. A covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. In order to comply with HIPAA, covered entities must, among other things, maintain privacy and security policies, train workforce members, maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, enter into confidentiality agreements with business associates, and permit individuals to access and amend their protected health information. In addition, covered entities must report breaches of unsecured (unencrypted) protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 calendar days from the discovery date of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain cases involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to report on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate can demonstrate that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised. 
 HIPAA violations may result in criminal penalties and substantial civil penalties per violation. These civil penalties are subject to annual updates to reflect changes to the consumer price index. State attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages up to $25,000 for violations of the same requirement in a calendar year in response to HIPAA violations that affect their state residents. HHS has the discretion in many cases to resolve HIPAA violations through informal means without the imposition of penalties. However, HHS is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect and can and has imposed significant penalties. HHS also conducts compliance audits, which could lead to further compliance reviews or to enforcement actions. 
 Our healthcare facilities continue to remain subject to other applicable federal or state laws that are more restrictive than the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, which could result in additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities whose inadequate data security programs may expose consumers to fraud, identity theft and privacy intrusions, including the security programs of entities subject to HIPAA regulation. Various state laws and regulations require entities that maintain individually identifiable information (even if not health-related) to report data breaches to affected individuals and, in some cases, state regulators. In connection with our corporate compliance program, we have implemented a comprehensive set of privacy and security policies and procedures. We expect compliance with HIPAA and other privacy and security standards to continue to impose significant costs on our hospitals and operations.
 State Certificate of Need Laws
 In some states where we operate hospitals and outpatient service facilities, the construction or expansion of healthcare facilities, the acquisition of healthcare facilities, the transfer or change of ownership related to healthcare facilities and the addition of new licensed beds or healthcare service lines at healthcare facilities may be subject to review, prior approval or notification with a state regulatory agency under a certificate of need (“CON”) program. Such laws are generally in place for the reviewing state regulatory agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services in a specific market. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 18 hospitals in 9 states that have adopted CON programs. See “Item 2. Properties” for a table that denotes the states where we operate hospitals in which CON programs are present. The failure to provide required notification and obtain necessary approval in states having a CON program can result in the inability to expand, acquire or change ownership related to 
 20

healthcare facilities in a particular market. Violations of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a hospital’s licenses. 
 In addition, some states in which we operate do not require a CON for the purchase, construction or expansion of healthcare facilities or services. Additionally, from time to time, statutes with existing requirements may repeal or limit the scope of the CON programs for future entry. In these cases, our competing healthcare providers could face lower barriers to entry and expansion into certain states where we operate hospitals. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 6 hospitals in 5 states that have not adopted CON programs.
 Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting
 Some states have adopted laws that prohibit unlicensed individuals or business entities from employing physicians. Some states also have adopted laws that prohibit unlicensed individuals or business entities from making direct or indirect payments to physicians or that prohibit these parties from engaging in fee-splitting arrangements. Physicians that violate these laws are subject to sanctions, including loss of licensure, civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements. Laws, such as these, vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or state regulatory agencies. We structure our arrangements with employed physicians to comply with the state laws where we operate. We can give no assurance that governmental agencies responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that we are in violation of these laws. These laws could also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations. See “— Employees and Medical Staff — Physicians” below for additional information on our employed physicians.
 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
 All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual that enters the hospital’s emergency department seeking treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition, including active labor, requires the hospital to either stabilize the patient’s condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another healthcare facility that can handle the condition. The obligation of the hospital to examine and stabilize emergency medical conditions or otherwise make an appropriate transfer of the patient to another suitable healthcare facility exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. Outpatient service facilities that lack emergency departments or otherwise do not treat emergency medical conditions are not generally subject to EMTALA; however, they are required to have policies and procedures that address the handling of situations in which an individual presents at their facility seeking emergency medical treatment, such as transferring the patient to the closest hospital with an emergency department. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition to these penalties, a harmed patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil lawsuit against that other hospital.
Medical Malpractice Tort Law Reform
 Laws related to medical malpractice liability have historically been maintained at the state level. All states have laws governing medical malpractice liability lawsuits. Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in medical malpractice lawsuits and many states have established caps on the damage awards or attorney fees permissible in such lawsuits. Recently, many states have introduced legislation to address medical malpractice tort reform. Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates. Medical malpractice reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, including medical and pharmaceutical waste products. We do not currently expect we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations. It is possible, however, that environmental issues may arise in the future which we cannot now predict.
Supply Contracts
 We purchase medical supplies, equipment, pharmaceuticals and certain other items under an agreement with a group purchasing organization (“GPO”) that covers all of our hospitals and their affiliated outpatient service facilities. By participating in a group purchasing organization, we believe that we can procure items at more competitively priced rates than we would pay for similar items without such agreement. In addition, we provide a service opportunity to our QHR hospital clients to contract with us for purchases that we make on their behalf under the terms of our agreement with this group purchasing organization. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we are experiencing supply chain disruptions, including shortages, delays and significant price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment.
 21

Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as contractual terms and conditions, to protect our rights in our intellectual property assets. However, third parties may develop intellectual property that is similar or superior to ours. We also license third-party software, other technology and certain trademarks through agreements that impose certain restrictions on our ability to use the licensed items. We control access to and use of our software and other technology through a combination of internal and external controls. Although we do not believe the intellectual property we utilize infringes any intellectual property right held by a third party, we could be prevented from utilizing such property and could be subject to significant damage awards if our use is found to do so.
 Agreements with CHS Related to the Spin-off
 In connection with the Spin-off and effective as of April 29, 2016, we entered into certain agreements with CHS that allocated between us and CHS the various assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) that were previously part of CHS. In addition, these agreements govern certain relationships between, and activities of, us and CHS for a definitive period of time after the Spin-off date, as specified by each individual agreement.
 A summary of these agreements follows:
  
• | Separation and Distribution Agreement. This agreement governed the principal actions of both QHC and CHS that needed to be taken in connection the Spin-off. It also sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of our relationship with CHS following the Spin-off.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tax Matters Agreement. This agreement governs respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of QHC and CHS after the Spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employee Matters Agreement. This agreement governs certain compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the current and former employees and non-employee directors of both QHC and CHS. It also allocated liabilities and responsibilities relating to employment matters, employee compensation and benefit plans and programs as of the Spin-off date.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the agreements referenced above, we entered into certain transition services agreements and other ancillary agreements with CHS, as described below, defining agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to certain or all of our hospitals, as determined by each agreement, commencing on the Spin-off date. Certain of these agreements have been terminated as described below. The remaining agreements generally have terms of five years. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited access we currently have to our hospitals for all functions unrelated to patient care, the transition of our Computer and Data Processing Services Agreement has been temporarily delayed. As a result, we are currently engaged in discussions with CHS regarding an extension of the term of the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement past April, 2021 to meet our information technology planning needs. We expect that these discussions will result in a mutually agreeable extension.
 A summary of the major provisions of the transition services agreements that were in place as of December 31, 2019 follows:
  
• | Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS for information technology infrastructure, support and maintenance. Services include, but are not limited to, operational support for various applications, oversight, maintenance and information technology support services, such as helpdesk, product support, network monitoring, data center operations, service ticket management and vendor relations. Fees are based on both a fixed charge for labor costs, as well as direct charges for all third-party vendor contracts entered into by CHS on QHC’s behalf.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employee Service Center Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS related to payroll processing and human resources information systems support. Fees are based on a fixed charge per employee headcount per month.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following agreements have been terminated and replaced with external service providers and internal resources:
  
• | Shared Service Centers Transition Services Agreement. This agreement was terminated effective October 1, 2019 and defined services provided by CHS related to billing and collections utilizing CHS shared services centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Receivables Collection Agreement (“PASI”). This agreement was terminated effective October 1, 2018 and defined services provided by CHS’ wholly-owned subsidiary, PASI, which served as a third-party collection agency to us related to accounts receivable collections of both active and bad debt accounts of QHC hospitals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Billing and Collection Agreement (“PPSI”). This agreement was terminated effective October 1, 2018 and defined services provided by CHS related to collections of accounts receivable generated by our affiliated outpatient healthcare facilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eligibility Screening Services Agreement. This agreement was terminated effective June 24, 2018 and defined services provided by CHS for financial and program criteria screening related to Medicaid or other program eligibility for pure self-pay patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22

The total expenses recorded by us under transition services agreements with CHS were $29.5 million, $51.2 million and $63.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
 Compliance Program
 We recognize that our compliance with laws and regulations impacting our business depends on individual employee actions as well as company-wide operations. We adopted a compliance program following the Spin-off for our entire business (the “Compliance Program”). Our Compliance Program focuses on aligning compliance responsibilities with operational functions and is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business. Our hospital and corporate office management teams manage and oversee compliance among the employees within our hospitals and outpatient services facilities, QHR and all other departments within our company.
 Our Compliance Program contains the following requirements, among others:
  
• | oversight of management at all levels;
--+---------------------------------------


• | a written code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”);
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | policies and procedures that address specific risk areas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | employee education and training programs;
--+------------------------------------------


• | an internal system available to employees and affiliates to report concerns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | auditing and monitoring programs; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | policies related to the enforcement of the Compliance Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the above, our Compliance Program includes policies and procedures related to the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security. It also includes procedures specific to claims preparation and submission, including procedures for coding, billing and annual cost reports. It addresses policies related to financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, compliance with the FCA, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law. The program includes policies specific to our compliance with EMTALA related to the treatment of hospital emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay. We continuously review our Compliance Program and make necessary updates or changes to be compliant with new laws and regulations or industry standards impacting our business.
 Our written Code of Conduct applies to all persons and businesses associated with our company, including directors, officers, employees and consultants. We have a confidential disclosure program to enhance the statement of ethical responsibility expected of our employees and all business associates with whom we work, including our accounting, financial reporting and asset management departments. Our Code of Conduct is posted on our website at www.quorumhealth.com.
 Corporate Integrity Agreement
 On July 28, 2014, CHS became subject to the terms of a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) arising from a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of their affiliated hospitals. The OIG bound us to the terms of the CHS CIA commencing on the Spin-off date and applying to us for the remainder of the five-year compliance term required of CHS, which terminated on July 27, 2019. We believe that we operated our business in compliance with the CIA and are unaware of any historical actions on our part that could represent a violation under the terms of the CIA. We submitted our fifth annual report to the OIG on August 15, 2019. The OIG reviewed the report and provided a letter officially closing the CIA between the OIG and us effective November 19, 2019.
Insurance Reserves
 Professional and General Liability Insurance and Workers’ Compensation Liability Insurance Reserves
 As part of the business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we maintain insurance exceeding a self-insured retention level for these types of claims. Our self-insurance reserves reflect the current estimate of all outstanding losses, including incurred but not reported losses, based on actuarial calculations as of period end. The loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future due to updated facts and circumstances, including our claims experience post Spin-off. Insurance expense in the income statements include the actuarially determined estimates for losses in the current year, including claims incurred but not reported, the changes in estimates for losses in prior years based on actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections, the insurance premiums for losses related to policies obtained to cover amounts in excess of our self-insured retention levels, the administrative costs of the insurance programs, and interest expense related to the discounted portions of these liabilities. Our reserves for professional and general liability and workers’ compensation liability claims are based on semi-annual actuarial calculations, which are discounted to 
 23

present value and consider historical claims data, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The liabilities for self-insured claims are discounted based on our risk-free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the self-insured claims are incurred and projected to be paid.
 The professional and general liability reserves as of December 31, 2019 included a reduction in the second quarter of 2019 of $26.9 million related to prior periods resulting from our semi-annual actuarial analysis. Factors contributing to the change in estimate include the use of valuation techniques that place more emphasis on our claims subsequent to the Spin-off compared to historical trends, as well as more reliance on industry trend factors. The reduction in the frequency and severity of our claims is the result of internal initiatives in the areas of patient safety, risk management, and claims management, as well as external factors such as tort reform in certain key states.
 A portion of our reserves for workers’ compensation and professional and general liability claims included on our balance sheets relates to reserved claims and incurred but not reported claims prior to the Spin-off. These claims were fully indemnified by CHS under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a result, we have a corresponding receivable from CHS related to these claims on our consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total liabilities of $82.5 million and $129.0 million related to insurance for professional and general liabilities and workers’ compensation liability, respectively, of which $45.1 million and $68.3 million, respectively, were the indemnified portions for which we have offsetting receivables from CHS.
 Under our current insurance arrangements, our self-insured retention level for professional and general liability claims is $5 million per claim. Additionally, we maintain a $0.5 million per claim, high deductible program for workers’ compensation. We maintain a separate insurance arrangement for professional and general liability related to QHR, due to the differing nature of this business. The self-insured retention level for QHR is $6 million for professional and general liability insurance.
 Employee Health Benefits
 We are self-insured for substantially all of the medical benefits of our employees. We maintain a liability for our current estimate of incurred but not reported employee health claims based on historical claims data provided by third-party administrators. The undiscounted reserve for self-insured employee health benefits was $7.8 million and $10.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Expense each period is based on the actual claims received during the period plus any adjustment to the liability for incurred but not reported employee health claims. 
Employees and Medical Staff
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 9,200 employees, including approximately 2,300 part-time employees. We are subject to various federal and state laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. We maintain a number of different employee benefit plans.
Physicians
 Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Our ability to generate revenues from our hospital operations business is impacted by the number, quality and specialty areas of practice of physicians providing healthcare services at our facilities, and additionally the scheduling and admitting of patients by these physicians. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 262 employed physicians at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities. Some physicians provide services in our healthcare facilities pursuant to a contract with us. These contracts generally describe the types of healthcare services that the physician is contracted to perform, establish the duties and obligations of the physician, require certain performance criteria be met by the physician and fix the compensation arrangements for the services performed by the physician. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the board of directors of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve the physician’s acceptance to the medical staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals that we do not own and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. It is essential to our hospital operations business that we attract an appropriate number of quality physicians in the specialty care service areas required to support our hospital operations business and that we maintain good relationships with our physicians. In some of our markets, physician recruitment and retention are affected by a shortage of physicians in certain desired specialty care service areas and are affected by the difficulty that physicians can experience in obtaining affordable malpractice insurance.
Unions and Labor Relations
 As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,500 employees, including approximately 500 part-time employees, at our five hospitals represented by labor unions. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages that had a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations.

Availability of Information
 We file certain reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We are an electronic filer, and the SEC maintains an Internet site at www.sec.gov that contains our reports, proxy and information statements and other information we file electronically. Our website is www.quorumhealth.com. We make available free of charge on this website under “Investor Relations — SEC Filings” our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such reports filed or furnished as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such reports to the SEC. We use our website as a channel of distribution for important company information. Important information, including press releases, investor presentations and financial information regarding our company, is routinely posted on or accessible on the Investor Relations subpage of our website, which is accessible by clicking on the tab labeled “Investor Relations” on our website home page. Our website and the information contained therein or linked thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Item 1A.Risk Factors
 Our company faces a variety of risks. Many of these risks are beyond our control and could cause our actual operating results and financial performance to be materially different from our expectations. Some of these risks are described below, including risks related to our business, the Chapter 11 Cases, the effect of the current coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the Spin-off, the U.S. healthcare industry, laws and regulations governing our industry, the securities markets and ownership of our common stock. Other risk factors, such as those related to our markets, operations, liquidity and interest rates, are described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” If any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors or those contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our shareholders could lose all or part of their investment. Furthermore, our actual operating and financial results may differ materially from those predicted in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures, including those summarized in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Risks Related to our Chapter 11 Proceedings
 Our voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and our ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, leaner company are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
 In 2019, we engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other things, analyzing various strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure needs, including strategic and refinancing alternatives to restructure our indebtedness in private transactions. These restructuring efforts led to the execution of the RSA and commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court on April 7, 2020.
 The Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Bankruptcy Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and profitability of our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, our providers, business partners, and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships. 
 Other significant risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases include the following:
  
• | our ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court’s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases, including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delays in the Chapter 11 Cases;
--+--------------------------------


• | our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effects of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on our business and the interest of various constituents, including our stockholders, business partners, vendors, physicians, medical staff and employees;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related advisory costs to affect our reorganization;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to maintain relationships with suppliers, business partners, patients, physicians, medical staff and employees and other third parties as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to fund and execute our business plan;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate debtor-in-possession financing;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25

 
• | risks associated with Bankruptcy Court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the length of time that we will operate with Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability of third parties to seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, to appoint a U.S. trustee or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 7”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with our ability to consummate the Plan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Due to the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases, the ultimate impact that the events that occur during these proceedings will have on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows cannot be predicted at this time.
 Operating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.
 Under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. For example, we must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:
  
• | engage in certain transactions with our vendors and suppliers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | buy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | grant liens; and
--+-----------------


• | finance our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Delays in the Chapter 11 Cases may increase the risks of our being unable to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.
 The RSA contemplates the consummation of the Plan through an orderly pre-packaged plan of reorganization, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate the Plan. A prolonged Chapter 11 proceeding could adversely affect our relationships with our business partners, suppliers, patients, physicians, medical staff and employees, among other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and our ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, a weakening of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could adversely affect our ability to implement the Plan (or any other plan of reorganization). If we are unable to consummate the Plan, we may be forced to liquidate our assets.
 We may not be able to obtain Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Plan or may have to modify the terms of the Plan.
 Even if the Plan is approved by each class of holders of claims and interests entitled to vote (a “Voting Class”), the Bankruptcy Court, which, as a court of equity, may exercise substantial discretion and may choose not to confirm the Plan. Bankruptcy Code Section 1129 requires, among other things, a showing that confirmation of the Plan will not be followed by liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization for us, and that the value of distributions to dissenting holders of claims and interests will not be less than the value such holders would receive if we, the debtors, liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Although we believe that the Plan will satisfy such tests, there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.
 Confirmation of the Plan will also be subject to certain conditions. These conditions may not be met and there can be no assurance that the Consenting Stakeholders will agree to modify or waive such conditions. Further, changed circumstances may necessitate changes to the Plan. Any such modifications could result in less favorable treatment than the treatment currently anticipated being included in the Plan based upon the agreed terms of the RSA. Such less favorable treatment could include a distribution of property (including the new common stock) to the class affected by the modification of a lesser value than currently anticipated to be included in the Plan or no distribution of property whatsoever under the Plan. Changes to the Plan may also delay the confirmation of the Plan and our emergence from bankruptcy, which could result in, among other things, incurred costs and expenses to the Debtors.
 Our ability to emerge from Chapter 11 and operate as a going concern thereafter will depend on our ability to obtain suitable exit financing and reduce our debt and debt service costs.
 The Plan provides that the Debtors will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases with a new senior secured asset-based credit facility that replaces the existing ABL Facility (the “Exit ABL Facility”). The Debtors do not have a commitment from either the current lenders under the ABL Facility or a third party to provide the Exit ABL Facility. There is no guarantee that the Debtors will be able to secure such a commitment and, thus, the Debtors may seek to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases without an Exit ABL Facility or with 
 26

an Exit ABL Facility on unfavorable terms. Either situation would negatively impact our ability to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases and continue to operate as a going concern.
 Additionally, our current capital structure includes a high level of indebtedness. Our Plan contemplates restructuring, renegotiating, or otherwise discharging a substantial portion of our debt. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully achieve sufficient reductions in our debt and debt service costs and other cost savings or otherwise meet our planned continuing obligations. Failure to achieve substantial interest cost reduction and other cost savings upon emergence from bankruptcy could materially hamper our ability to operate profitably after our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, and could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.
 Termination of our exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances could result in competing plans of reorganization, which could have less favorable terms or result in significant litigation and expenses.
 We currently have the exclusive right to file a Chapter 11 plan through August 5, 2020, and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances of any such plan through October 4, 2020. Such deadlines may be extended from time to time “for cause” (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. However, it is also possible that (a) parties in interest could seek to shorten or terminate such exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods “for cause” (as permitted by section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code) or (b) that such periods could expire without extension.
 Although we expect to resolve the Chapter 11 Cases quickly, if our exclusive plan filing and solicitation periods expire or are terminated, other parties in interest will be permitted to file alternative plans of reorganization. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate us continuing as a going concern, us being liquidated, us or our assets being acquired by a third party, us being merged with a competitor, or some other proposal. There can be no assurances that recoveries under any such alternative plan would be as favorable to creditors as the Plan. In addition, the proposal of competing plans of reorganization may entail significant litigation and significantly increase the expenses of administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, which could deplete creditor recoveries under any plan.
 If the RSA is terminated, our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan could be materially and adversely affected.
 The RSA contains a number of termination events, upon the occurrence of which certain parties to the RSA may terminate the agreement. If the RSA is terminated as to all parties thereto, each of the parties will be released from its obligations in accordance with the terms of the RSA. Such termination may result in the loss of support for the Plan by the parties to the RSA, which could adversely affect our ability to confirm and consummate the Plan. If the Plan is not consummated, there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 Cases would not be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any new Plan would be as favorable to holders of claims against the Company and its subsidiaries as contemplated by the RSA.
 The restructuring of the Company has required and will continue to require a substantial amount of time and attention of our senior management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 The restructuring of the Company has required and will continue to require a substantial portion of time and attention from our senior management team and will leave them with less time to devote to the operations of our business. Throughout the months of January, February and March of 2020, our management has spent considerable time participating in the development of recapitalization and financial reorganization plans, the business plan for the Company, the RSA and related reorganization activities. This diversion of management’s attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases is protracted.
 We may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.
 As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
 As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may not be comparable nor be indicative of our future financial performance.
 During the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our future financial performance.
 Our capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our results of operations 
 27

and financial condition following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the results of operations and financial condition reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
 We may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases.
 The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to the filing of our Chapter 11 Cases (i) will be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) will be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. However, there can be no assurance that the aggregate amount of such claims that are not subject to treatment under the plan of reorganization or that are not discharged will not be material.
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
 We have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, raise additional capital, finance operations and capital expenditures, pursue desirable business opportunities or successfully operate our business in the future.
 Prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court, we were a highly leveraged company. As of December 31, 2019, our total debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, was $1.3 billion.
 Our overall leverage, terms of our financing arrangements and debt service obligations could have important consequences to us, including:
  
• | limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital and capital expenditures, to fund growth or to fund general corporate purposes, even when necessary for us to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies were revised downward;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | subjecting us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to make interest payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our operating cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities, financial obligations and other general corporate expenditures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limiting our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industry in which we operate, and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and governmental regulations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in patient preferences, the success of responding to changing payment models, the success in transitioning our IT TSA from CHS and regulatory issues and pressure from competitors.
 The agreements governing our debt, including our credit facilities and the indenture governing our Senior Notes, contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.
 As of April 7, 2020, we were in default under the credit agreements governing our ABL Credit Facility and Senior Credit Facility and under the indenture governing our Senior Notes due to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases with the Bankruptcy Court. Further, other covenant defaults have occurred and are continuing under the credit agreements governing our ABL Credit Facility and Senior Credit Facility and under the indenture governing our Senior Notes, including as a result of cross-defaults between the credit agreements and the indenture. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
 Other agreements that we enter into governing our debt, including in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, have or will contain covenants that impose restrictions on us. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions.
 Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. 
 We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt. In connection with the Spin-off, on April 29, 2016, we entered into two credit agreements, the Senior Credit Facility and the ABL Credit Facility, that subject us to variable interest rates tied to LIBOR or a base rate. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding principal amount of debt, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, of $835.3 million subject to variable rates of interest, which included $97.0 
 28

million of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2019. If the interest rate on our variable rate long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, after taking into consideration the 1% floor on our Term Loan Facility, was 100 basis points higher for the year ended December 31, 2019, the additional interest expense impacting net income (loss) would have been $8.5 million.
 Other indebtedness that we incur, including in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, has or will contain variable interest rates. Subject to a Bankruptcy Court order approving the DIP Facility, the lenders under the DIP Facility will make available to us loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million, and such loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the adjusted LIBOR used for the Senior Credit Facility, plus 10.00%. Furthermore, the Plan provides that we will emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases with exit financing arrangements, and depending on the final terms, such exit financing arrangements may expose us to variable rate interest risk.
 Our financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern.
 Our financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. In an effort to achieve liquidity that would be sufficient to meet all of our commitments, we have undertaken a number of actions, including divesting underperforming hospitals, negotiating with our creditors and stakeholders, and reducing recurring expenses. However, we believe that even after taking these actions, we will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy all of our future financial obligations, comply with our debt covenants, and execute our business plan. As a result, we filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 7, 2020. The risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, the events of default under our credit agreements and the indenture governing our Senior Notes, and the other conditions impacting our business raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
 The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our cash flows could also be negatively impacted, particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant amount of time.
 The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) is a global pandemic that is significantly affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are likely to be materially adversely affected, particularly if the pandemic persists for a significant amount of time.
 From an operational perspective, we are focused on providing the safest possible environment for our employees, physicians and other caregivers, and for the care of our patients, while safeguarding patient information. We are working with federal, state and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases in the communities we serve and are taking or supporting measures to try to limit the spread of the virus and to mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. Although we are implementing considerable safety measures, as a front line provider of healthcare services, we are deeply exposed to the health and economic effects of COVID-19, many of which will have a material adverse impact on our employees, as well as our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows that we are not currently able to fully quantify. For example, in 2020, we had to furlough certain employees due to the lack of volume at our hospitals, and these furloughs may persist for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are reassigning hospital personnel with pre-existing conditions or restrictions that make them especially vulnerable to COVID-19 where possible, while some are self-quarantining and not available to work at our facilities during this time. We have also instituted a work-from-home policy for certain of our corporate and administrative offices. Even with such steps, exposure to COVID-19 patients has increased risks to doctors and nurses, which may further reduce our operating capacity. All of these actions could result in reduced employee morale, labor unrest, work stoppages or other workforce disruptions.
 In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of elective surgeries, physician office visits and emergency room volumes at our facilities due to restrictive measures, like quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and general concerns related to the risk of contracting COVID-19 from interacting with the healthcare system. We believe that certain of these patient volume declines reflect a deferral of healthcare services utilization to a later period, rather than a permanent reduction in demand for our services. Given the general necessity of the healthcare services we provide, we anticipate that this deferral of services may create a backlog of demand in the future, in addition to the resumption of historically normal activity; however, there is no assurance that either will occur. In addition, while the hospitals that we operate in a wide range of geographies have not experienced major capacity constraints to date, other hospitals in areas that are centers of the COVID-19 outbreak have been overwhelmed, experiencing excessive demand, potentially preventing them from treating all patients who seek care. Despite considerable efforts to source vital supplies, we are also experiencing supply chain disruptions, including shortages, delays and significant price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment (“PPE”). Staffing, equipment, and pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may also impact our ability to admit and treat patients.
 29

We may also require an increased level of working capital if we experience extended billing and collection cycles as a result of displaced employees, payors, revenue cycle management contractors, or otherwise. Broad economic factors resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including increasing unemployment rates and reduced consumer spending, also affect our service mix, revenue mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and layoffs in the areas we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, requiring an increased level of working capital. If general economic conditions continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected. 
 In addition, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by federal or state laws, regulations, orders, or other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic or the U.S. healthcare system, which, if adopted, could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We may also be subject to lawsuits from patients, employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at our facilities. Such actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs, though there is no certainty at this time whether any such lawsuits will be filed or the outcome of such lawsuits if filed. Our professional and general liability insurance may not cover all claims against us.
 The foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could heighten the risks in certain of the other risk factors described herein.
 The CARES Act is recent legislation in which there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding its implementation. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for assistance under the CARES Act, or if we do qualify, there is no certainty as to the amount of assistance we will receive.
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act is an approximate $2 trillion emergency economic stimulus package passed in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The CARES Act includes broad sweeping provisions including direct financial assistance to Americans in the form of one-time payments to individuals; aid to small businesses in the form of loans and grants; efforts to stabilize the U.S. economy and keep Americans employed in general; and support for healthcare professionals, patients and hospitals. We may have access to potential additional sources of liquidity through funding that may be available to healthcare providers under the CARES Act. The CARES Act includes provisions providing flexibility and financial resources to healthcare providers during this public health emergency. The CARES Act provides funding to support public entities, Medicare or Medicaid enrolled suppliers and providers, and for-profit and not-for-profit entities specified by HHS that provide diagnoses, testing, or care for COVID-19 patients. The funding, to be included in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund that is administered by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, is intended to reimburse providers for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus. The CARES Act also provides funding to support rural critical access hospitals. Also included in the CARES Act are numerous income tax provisions including changes to the Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) rules and the business interest expense deduction rules under Code Section 163(j). Factors that could affect our ability to receive funding include our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the finalization of regulations under the CARES Act, among other factors. Due to the recent enactment of this legislation, there is a high degree of uncertainty around its implementation and we continue to assess the potential impacts of this legislation on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will receive funding under the CARES Act.
 The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on global markets could affect our future access to liquidity and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 The coronavirus has spread throughout much of the world after initially surfacing in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our business is unknown. State and local authorities in the United States, like their counterparts in many other countries, have since forced many businesses to temporarily shut down in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus, and Americans are being told by public officials to practice “social distancing.” Global stock markets have reacted very negatively, and economists are projecting a sharp economic slowdown, at least in the near term, even if governments take emergency relief measures. While the economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 is difficult to assess or predict, the COVID-19 pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital in the future, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. The situation is constantly evolving, however, so the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact businesses and the economy is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be affected.
 A future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the markets in which we operate hospitals, or which otherwise impacts our healthcare facilities, could adversely impact our business.
 If a future pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to affect any or all of the markets in which we operate hospitals, in addition to or following the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public’s trust in 
 30

healthcare facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose or that are treating or have treated patients affected by contagious diseases. If any of our healthcare facilities were involved in treating patients for such a contagious disease, other patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care from our healthcare facilities. Further, a future pandemic might adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our healthcare facilities. Moreover, we cannot predict the costs associated with the potential treatment of a future infectious disease outbreak by our hospitals or preparation for such treatment. A future pandemic could also adversely impact our business in ways that are difficult to predict. Although we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, the potential impact of a future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, with respect to our markets or our healthcare facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business. In addition, if such events lead to a significant or prolonged impact on capital or credit markets or economic growth, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 If reimbursement rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs or commercial insurance and other managed care payors are reduced, if we are unable to maintain favorable contract terms with payors or comply with our payor contract obligations, if insured individuals move to insurance programs or plans with greater coverage exclusions or narrower networks, or if insurance coverage is otherwise restricted, our net operating revenues may decline.
 Our net patient revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, were 49.2%, 47.0% and 49.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were 39.9%, 40.2% and 38.1% from managed care and commercial payors for these respective periods. Healthcare expenditures continue to increase and state governments continue to face budgetary shortfalls. Driven by these financial factors and ongoing health reform efforts, federal and state governments have made, and continue to make, significant changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including changes in payment methodologies, reductions in reimbursement payment levels and reductions to payments made to providers under state supplemental payment programs. Some of these changes have already decreased, and could further decrease in the future, the amount of payments we receive for our services.
 In addition, governmental and commercial payors, as well as other third parties from whom we receive payment for our services, attempt to control healthcare costs by, for example, requiring hospitals to discount payments for their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plan networks, restricting coverage through utilization reviews, reducing coverage of inpatient services and shifting coverage of care to outpatient settings when possible, requiring prior authorizations for non-emergency services and implementing alternative payment models. The ability of commercial payors to control healthcare costs using these measures may be enhanced by the increasing consolidation of private health insurance companies and managed care companies and vertical integration of health insurers with healthcare providers. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure. Furthermore, our contracts with payors require us to comply with a number of terms related to the provision of services and billing for services. If we are unable to negotiate increased reimbursement rates, maintain existing reimbursement rates or other favorable contract terms, effectively respond to payor cost controls or comply with the terms of our payor contracts, the payments we receive for our services may be reduced or we may be involved in disputes with payors and experience payment denials, both prospectively and retroactively.
 In recent years, the percentage of the population with health insurance has increased, driven primarily by various provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. However, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. In addition, the President signed an executive order directing agencies to relax limits on certain health plans, potentially allowing for fewer plans that adhere to specific Affordable Care Act coverage mandates. Further, individuals are increasingly enrolling in high-deductible health plans, which tend to have lower reimbursement rates for providers along with higher co-payments and deductibles due from the patient in comparison to traditional plans. These plans, sometimes referred to as consumer directed plans, may even exclude our hospitals and employed physicians from coverage.
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of our reimbursements will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
 Changes to Medicaid supplemental payment programs may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.
 Medicaid state supplemental payments to providers are separate from and in addition to those made under a state’s standard Medicaid program. For example, federal law requires state Medicaid programs to make DSH payments to hospitals that serve significant numbers of Medicaid and uninsured patients. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation provide for reductions in Medicaid DSH payments. Under the budget bill signed into law in February 2018, Medicaid DSH payments will be reduced by $4 billion in 2020 and by $8 billion per year from 2021 through 2025. On December 20, 2019, these cuts were delayed until May 22, 2020; however, the passing of the CARES Act further delayed these cuts through December 2020. The extension of the delay until December 2020 has an estimated impact of $1.1 million in additional Medicaid state supplemental payments for our hospitals. Future reductions in Medicaid DSH payments and the funding of similar programs could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results 
 31

of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the future of our Medicaid supplemental payment programs beyond the extension noted above will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
 Supplemental payment programs are being reviewed by certain state agencies, and some states have made or may make waiver requests to CMS to replace existing supplemental payment programs. These reviews and waiver requests may result in restructuring of such programs and could cause reductions in or elimination of the payments. In December 2017, CMS announced that it will phase out funding for Designated State Health Programs under Medicaid waivers granted pursuant to section 1115 of the Social Security Act. The Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program is an example of such a waiver. The program offsets some costs of providing uncompensated care and incentivizes delivery system reform under a waiver granted by CMS. In December 2017, CMS has approved an extension of the Texas Medicaid waiver through September 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out the federal funding related to delivery system reform, eliminating those federal payments beginning October 1, 2021. In addition, Texas will not receive any federal financial participation for uncompensated care pool payments until CMS approves revised uncompensated care protocol policies for the state.
 Many states currently fund significant portions of their Medicaid supplemental payment programs through intergovernmental transfers ("IGTs") and/or provider tax methodologies. In general, a "provider tax,” (also referred to as a "fee" or "assessment") is adopted by states to collect revenue from specified categories of providers. Such taxes must be implemented in accordance with a complex series of federal regulations. Taxes and IGTs (often a separate and distinct source of revenue) are used to generate new funds that can be matched with federal funds. These financing mechanisms often enable states to receive additional federal Medicaid dollars without increasing their overall state tax burden. In turn, the additional federally matched Medicaid dollars can be used to increase Medicaid reimbursement to providers.
 On November 12, 2019, CMS proposed the Medicaid Fiscal Accountability Rule (CMS-2393-P) ("MFAR"). CMS indicates that MFAR is aimed at strengthening the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program and helping to ensure that state supplemental payments and financing arrangements are transparent and value-driven. If finalized, the MFAR has the potential to require profound changes to Medicaid supplemental payment programs and the financing methodologies noted above. In general, the rule would limit states' ability to use IGTs to fund their Medicaid programs, and would require provider tax funding structures to be redesigned. Such changes would likely impact every state in which supplemental payment programs are funded through IGTs or provider tax methodologies.
 More specifically, the MFAR would require IGTs to be derived solely from state or local tax revenues. This would significantly limit the use of IGTs as a source of state financing, and would likely reduce and cap the amount of funds available to governmental entities for purposes of funding Medicaid supplemental payments. The MFAR would further prohibit mitigation structures currently used by many providers to reduce financial risks associated with provider tax programs by prohibiting "pooling" arrangements. States would further be prohibited from taxing Medicaid utilization at a higher rate, even when other regulatory requirements are met, which would require many states to change the structure of their provider tax programs.
 The MFAR would also require states to report provider-specific payment information on payments received for state plan services and through demonstration programs, as well as identify the specific authority for these payments, and the source of the non-federal share. The rule would mandate sun-setting of existing and new supplemental payment programs after no more than 3 years and require states to request a new CMS approval to continue a supplemental payment beyond a maximum 3 year approved period.
 The timing of the proposed rule may also be problematic for many state governments. Many state legislatures do not convene until mid-January, near or at the end of CMS' comment period for the MFAR. This provides little time for states to assess the impact of the rule or address it through state budget changes, as the MFAR could be finalized during state legislative sessions, or after such sessions have concluded.
 The full impact of the MFAR is difficult to assess, but if finalized, it would likely have a significant impact on Medicaid supplemental payment programs in the states in which we operate. Due to the limitations on financing mechanisms, and other restrictions that would be imposed on such supplemental payments, the MFAR could result in decreases in our Medicaid revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 In December 2017, CMS approved Phase V of California’s HQAF program, with a program period of January 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019. The HQAF program provides funding for supplemental payments to hospitals that serve Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. The supplemental payments are funded in part by the federal government. Phase V of California’s HQAF program expired on June 30, 2019 and the next phase of the program, Phase VI, began July 1, 2019 and is expected to be a 30 month program. We cannot provide any assurances of the timing of CMS’ approval of the next phase of the HQAF program or the timing of the related cash flows. In addition, changes to the Medi-Cal program may affect the availability of funding for supplemental payments.
 As a result of the increase in reviews of claims filed for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, we may experience delayed payments or incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us under these programs.
 We are subject to routine post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare and Medicaid for reimbursement for our healthcare services provided to covered patients. The number and parameters of claims subject to these post-payment reviews may increase as a result of federal and state governmental healthcare cost-containment initiatives, including enhanced medical necessity reviews for Medicare patients admitted as inpatients to hospitals for certain procedures. Furthermore, 
 32

CMS contracts with Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) to perform a post-payment targeted review process that employs data analysis techniques in order to identify Medicare and Medicaid claims most likely to contain overpayments, such as incorrectly coded services, short stay admissions, incorrect payment amounts, non-covered services and duplicate payments. The claims review strategies used by RACs generally include a review of high dollar claims, including inpatient hospital claims. As a result, a large majority of the total payment adjustments determined by RACs relate to hospital claims. In addition, CMS employs Medical Integrity Contractors {“MICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims to identify potential overpayments. State Medicaid agencies and other private third-party contractors have also increased their review activities. Third-party audits or investigations of Medicare or Medicaid claims could result in increases or decreases in our revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when the related healthcare services were performed, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 Payment recoveries resulting from post-payment reviews and denials are appealable. However, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2019 was over three years. As a result of a federal court ruling in 2018, however, the processing time is being reduced as a federal judge ordered HHS to decrease the number of pending Medicare appeals according to a specific schedule by FY 2022. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
 A material portion of our revenues are concentrated in a few states which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in that state.
 Our revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in the state of Illinois and Oregon where we generate a significant portion of our patient revenues. We currently operate eight hospitals in Illinois and one hospital in Oregon, which collectively accounted for 54.6%, 54.1% and 49.0% of our net patient revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes to Medicaid and other governmental payor programs in these states, including reductions in reimbursement rates or delays in timing of reimbursement payments, could also have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of healthcare reform initiatives, including changes to the Affordable Care Act, and our business may be adversely affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed entirely or if provisions benefitting our operations are significantly modified.
 In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increased access to health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Affordable Care Act, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. As currently structured, the Affordable Care Act, expands health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms, reduces Medicare reimbursement to hospitals, and promotes value-based purchasing. There are currently several public and private initiatives that aim to transition payment models from passive volume-based reimbursement to models that are tied to the quality and value of services. We are limited in our ability to reduce the direct costs of providing care to patients. We are unable to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms, whether such reforms are implemented by government or other industry participants, such as private payors and large employer groups, or the potential impact of such changes to our operations.
 The Trump administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation and/or its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. In addition, a presidential executive order has been signed that directs agencies to minimize “economic and regulatory burdens” of the Affordable Care Act. CMS administrators have indicated that they intend to grant states additional flexibility in the administration of state Medicaid programs, including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. There is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the Affordable Care Act will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of alternative provisions, and the impact of alternative provisions on providers as well as other healthcare industry participants. Further, Congress could eliminate or alter provisions beneficial to us while leaving in place provisions reducing our reimbursement. In addition, in December 2018, a federal judge in Texas issued a decision finding the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, Texas v. U.S., N.D. Tex., No. 4:18-cv-00167 (Dec. 14, 2017). This decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which ruled, in December 2019 in Texas v. U.S., 945 F.3d (5th Cir. 2019), that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded back to the Texas court to evaluate whether other provisions of the Affordable Care Act could survive without the individual mandate. A group of Democratic state officials and the Democratic-led House of Representatives have petitioned the Supreme Court to review the decision, and there continues to be uncertainty about the future of the law. Efforts to repeal or change the Affordable Care Act or implement other initiatives intended to reform healthcare delivery and financial systems may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.

Further, several new start-up companies have entered the growing healthcare technology sector, which is expected to grow to approximately $280 billion by 2021, according to MarketsandMarkets Private Research Ltd. This emerging sector aims to fundamentally change how healthcare is financed and delivered and has started to work with large employers and private payors to implement reforms to private health insurance. Larger technology companies, such as Amazon and Alphabet's Google unit, also have demonstrated interest in this sector through the establishment of joint ventures with emerging companies. At this time, we are unable to predict the nature and success of these private initiatives, but they may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or capital resources.
 If we experience growth in self-pay revenues, or if we experience deterioration in the collectability of patient responsibility accounts, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
 The primary uncertainty in collectability of our revenues relates to uninsured patients and the patient financial responsibility portion of payments due from insured patients. Collections on self-pay account balances are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay, the effectiveness of R1 RCM’s collection efforts, the effectiveness of our third-party collection agencies and our own collection efforts. Significant changes in payor mix, centralized business office operations, in-market or overall U.S. economic conditions, or new and changing laws and regulations related to federal and state governmental healthcare coverage, among other things, could adversely impact our estimates of accounts receivable collectability.
 Moreover, we may be adversely affected by growth in the patient financial responsibility portion of payments for services or other conditions or restrictions associated with
 governmental and non-governmental healthcare plans and programs. Individuals are increasingly using healthcare savings accounts and participating in more narrow or tiered network programs. Our ability to improve collections of our patient accounts (as well as the ability of those collecting patient accounts on our behalf) may be limited by statutory, regulatory and investigatory initiatives, including private lawsuits directed at hospital charges and collection practices for uninsured and underinsured patients. In addition, a deterioration of economic conditions in the United States could lead to higher levels of uninsured patients, result in higher levels of patients covered by lower-paying governmental programs, result in fiscal uncertainties related to both governmental and non-governmental payors and could limit the economic ability of patients to make payments for which they are responsible. If we experience growth in self-pay revenues volume or deterioration in collectability of patient accounts, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
 In recent years, we have experienced increasing numbers of individuals covered by Medicaid or commercial insurance plans primarily due to the insurance expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act. However, efforts to repeal or revise the Affordable Care Act have caused uncertainty with regard to the future of this statute and its effects on the size of the uninsured population of U.S. citizens. In 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. There is also uncertainty regarding the number and identity of states that will ultimately expand their Medicaid programs, and on what terms. These factors, among others, make it difficult to predict changes to the percentage of our revenues comprised of self-pay revenues.
 If we are unable to effectively compete for patients, local residents in the markets where we operate hospitals may choose to use other hospitals and healthcare providers for medical treatment.
 The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients and physician affiliations. We are the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services in 19 of our markets, which we generally define as the county where our hospital is located, which means we typically have less direct competition for our hospital services. Our hospitals face competition for patients from out-of-market hospitals, including hospitals in urban areas that may have more comprehensive specialty care service lines, more advanced medical equipment and technology, more extensive medical research capabilities and greater access to medical education programs. Patients who receive medical treatment from an out-of-market hospital may subsequently shift their preferences to that hospital for future healthcare services. We also face competition from other specialty care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that are not affiliated with us. Our hospitals and many of the hospitals with which we compete engage in physician alignment strategies, which may include employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, participating in ACOs and, to the extent permitted by law, physician ownership of healthcare facilities.
 We face competition from municipal and not-for-profit hospitals. In our markets where we are not the sole provider of general and acute hospital healthcare services, our primary competitor is generally a not-for-profit hospital. Not-for-profit hospitals are typically owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities which are financially supported by endowments and charitable contributions. Not-for-profit hospitals do not pay income or property taxes and can make capital investments without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and to offer more specialized services than those available at our hospitals. If our competitors are better able to attract patients with these offerings, we may experience an overall decline in our patient volumes and operating revenues. Recent consolidations of not-for-profit hospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure.
 Our ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice related to both physicians and hospitals by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider. For example, plans with narrow network structures restrict the number of participating in-network provider plans, and tiered network structures impose higher cost-sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. If we are unable to 
 34

participate in plan networks or favorable tiers or are otherwise unable to retain or maintain favorable contracts with health plans, our patient volumes may decrease and our revenues may be reduced. In addition, healthcare industry participants are increasingly pursuing alignment initiatives, such as the acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health. Integration among insurers and providers and cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may shift costs, accelerate further change, and impact our ability to compete in ways that are difficult to predict.
 Trends toward increasing clinical transparency and value-based purchasing may have an adverse impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. The CMS Hospital Compare website makes available to the public certain data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. In addition, hospitals are required to publish their standard charges for healthcare items and services or their policy for allowing the public to review a list of their standard charges for healthcare services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results on quality of care measures or patient satisfaction surveys, if our results are lower than the results of our competitors, or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients.
 We expect these competitive trends to continue. If we are unable to compete effectively with other healthcare providers, local residents may seek healthcare services from providers other than our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities.
 A significant decline in operating results or other indicators of impairment at one or more of our facilities, including outpatient ancillary affiliated entities, could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings to impair the value of long-lived assets.
 Our operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, including property, equipment, software and other long-lived intangible assets. If one of our hospitals or other healthcare facilities experiences declining operating results or is adversely impacted by one or more of the risk factors related to our business, we may not be able to recover the carrying value of those assets through our future operating cash flows. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether changes in future undiscounted cash flows reflect any potential impairment in the fair value of our long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded impairment of $42.8 million, $77.1 million and $45.4 million because of declining operating results and projections of future cash flows at certain of our hospitals. See Note 2 — Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill in the accompanying financial statements.
 If the fair value of one or both of our reporting units declines, it could result in a material, non-cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill.
 The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions related to our cost of capital and other factors impacting our fair value models. Future estimates of fair value could be adversely affected if the actual outcome of one or more of these assumptions changes materially in the future, including lower than expected hospital patient volumes, reduced reimbursement or increased operating costs. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired when events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017 we recorded $6.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of impairment to goodwill related to certain hospitals we intended for divestiture. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 If we fail to improve the financial and operating performance of our existing hospitals, we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy.
 Some of our existing hospitals are experiencing lower operating margins than other hospitals in our portfolio and we may occasionally experience delays in improving the operating margins of our existing hospitals. In the future, if we are unable to improve the operating margins of these existing hospitals or operate them profitably we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy. To the extent that our operating margins were to decline as a result of financial and operating performance at our hospitals, we could be unable to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreements or be limited or precluded from obtaining future borrowings by the terms of our credit agreements and the indenture governing our Senior Notes.
 The failure or downsizing of large employers, or the closure of manufacturing or other major facilities in our markets, could have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals.
 The economies in the markets in which most of our hospitals operate are often dependent on a small number of large employers, especially manufacturing or other major facilities. These employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals and outpatient service facilities for their medical care. The failure of one or more large employers, or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at manufacturing or other facilities located in or near the markets in which we operate hospitals, could cause affected residents to move elsewhere for employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them. The occurrence of these events may cause a reduction in our revenues and adversely impact our results of operations.
 35

We are subject to a variety of operational, legal and financial risks associated with outsourcing functions to third parties.
 We have outsourced to CHS, through various transition services agreements, certain services including, among others, services related to information technology, payroll processing and other human resources functions. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of any parties in which we delegate services; however, the transition services agreements with CHS were executed in connection with the Spin-off, based upon certain business and financial assumptions. To the extent that any of the transition services agreements are determined not to benefit us in their current form, our ability to renegotiate, rescind or reform any or all of the agreements may be limited or non-existent, and our business could be adversely affected.
 On May 8, 2019, we entered into an agreement with R1 RCM to receive end-to-end revenue cycle management services. The agreement with R1 RCM has, among other things, allowed for us to transition our billing and collection services from CHS to R1 RCM. In July 2019, R1 RCM began providing limited services to us, such as status review on aged accounts receivable and insurance denials. Effective October 1, 2019, we transitioned our billing and collection services from CHS to R1 RCM. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be affected by the ability of R1 RCM, as provider of our revenue cycle management services, to timely and appropriately bill and collect.
 Arrangements with third-party service providers may make our operations vulnerable if these vendors fail to satisfy their obligations to us as a result of their performance, changes in their own operations, financial condition or other matters outside of our control. We may also face legal, financial or reputational harm for the actions or omissions of such providers, and we may not have effective recourse against the providers. Effective management, development and implementation of our outsourcing strategies are important to our business strategy. If there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes or our third-party service providers do not perform, we may not be able to fully realize on a timely basis the economic and other benefits of the outsourcing services or other relationships we enter into with key vendors, which could result in substantial costs, divert management’s attention from other strategic activities, negatively affect employee morale or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning arrangements with key vendors, including the transition services agreements with CHS, could result in additional costs and a risk of operational problems, delays in collections from payors, potential errors and possible control issues during the termination and transition processes, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 A material disruption of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 We have entered into a Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement with CHS, pursuant to which CHS provides information technology infrastructure, support and maintenance services. The term of the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement is scheduled to expire in April 2021. We are currently engaged in discussions with CHS regarding an extension of the term of the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement past April 2021 to meet our information technology planning needs. We expect that these discussions will result in a mutually agreeable extension. However, in the event that the term of the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement is not extended, our costs may increase as a result of having to procure information technology services from third parties. In addition, we may not be able to replace these services in a timely manner or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions, including cost, comparable to the Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement. A material disruption of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 The failure to obtain our medical supplies and drugs at favorable prices could cause our operating results to be adversely affected.
 We have entered into a participation agreement with a group purchasing organization (“GPO”). GPOs attempt to obtain favorable pricing on medical supplies and drugs with manufacturers and vendors, sometimes by negotiating exclusive supply arrangements in exchange for discounts. To the extent these exclusive supply arrangements are challenged or deemed unenforceable, we could incur higher costs than anticipated for our medical supplies obtained through the GPO. Also, there can be no assurance that our arrangement with the GPO will provide the expected discounts on a long-term basis. Furthermore, costs of medical supplies and drugs may continue to increase due to market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product and drug releases. Higher costs could cause our operating results to be adversely affected.
 Our inability to recruit and retain quality physicians could adversely impact our performance.
 Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the healthcare facilities at which they practice. The success of our healthcare facilities depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals and other healthcare facilities, our ability to employ or contract with quality physicians, the admitting and utilization practices of employed and non-employee physicians, maintaining good relations with physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. In many of the markets we serve, many physicians have admitting privileges at other healthcare facilities in addition to our healthcare facilities. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation or employment with our healthcare facilities at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate supporting medical staff or technologically advanced medical equipment and facilities that meet the needs or expectations of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.
 36

Our labor costs could be adversely affected by competition for medical staff, a shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.
 In addition to our physicians, the operations of our healthcare facilities are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our hospital management teams and other medical staff, such as nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists and lab technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and medical staff responsible for the daily operations of our healthcare facilities. In some markets across the United States, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue for healthcare providers. We may be required to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract medical staff. In addition, some states have, and others could adopt, mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues at hospitals where admissions must be limited in order to meet the required ratios.
 As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,500 employees, including approximately 500 part-time employees, at our five hospitals represented by labor unions. Increased or ongoing labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs or otherwise adversely impact us. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our labor costs could increase significantly. In addition, when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operations during any strike periods could increase our labor costs and otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.
 If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise the payment rates for our healthcare services to offset these increased costs. A significant portion of our revenues are subject to fixed reimbursement rates, which constrains our ability to pass along the impact of these increased costs to the patient or other third-party payors. In the event we are not effective at recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical staff, or we are unable to control our labor costs in relation to certain events and circumstances, the increase in our labor costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 Significant fluctuations and volatility in cost, such as labor, medical supply and drug costs, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 The healthcare industry is labor intensive. Salaries, benefits and other labor-related costs increase during periods of inflation and periods of labor shortages for nurses and other medical staff, which may differ depending on the geographic area in which a hospital is located. In addition, the Affordable Care Act is subject to ongoing revisions and possible repeal and replacement, which may lead to substantially higher costs to us related to providing employee medical benefits. We are also exposed to rising costs for medical supplies and drugs due to inflationary and other pricing pressures on our suppliers, including our group purchasing organization. We have implemented cost control measures to monitor and manage the impact of rising operating costs and expenses on our operating margins, including, among others, the reduction of costs in non-labor intensive categories. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to adequately offset the impact that any future increases in labor costs, employee medical benefit costs or other operating costs and expenses may have on our business which could adversely impact our operating margins in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our costs will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
 Our hospitals and other healthcare facilities may be negatively impacted by severe weather, earthquakes, power outages and other factors beyond our control, which could restrict patient access to care or cause one or more of our facilities to close temporarily.
 The results of operations of our hospitals and outpatient service facilities may be adversely impacted by severe weather conditions, including hurricanes and widespread winter storms or earthquakes, power outages or other factors beyond our control that could cause disruption to patient scheduling or displacement of our patients, employees, physicians and clinical staff, and may force certain of our facilities to close temporarily. In certain geographic areas, we have a concentration of hospitals and outpatient service facilities that may be simultaneously affected by adverse weather conditions or other events. These types of disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 If our adoption and utilization of electronic health record systems fails to satisfy CMS standards, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
 Under the HITECH Act, MACRA 
and other laws, HHS has established Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs to encourage hospitals and healthcare professionals to adopt EHR technology. Eligible hospitals can receive Medicaid incentive payments for their adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology; Medicare incentive payments are no longer available because under MACRA the Medicare EHR incentive program was transitioned to become one of the four components of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) under the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”). 
Under the QPP, eligible healthcare professionals are also subject to positive or negative payment adjustments based, in part, on their use of EHR technology
. If our hospitals and healthcare professionals are unable to properly adopt, maintain, and utilize certified EHR technology, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments under the Medicaid EHR incentive program (also known as the “Promoting Interoperability Program”), and we could be subject to negative payment adjustments under the QPP that may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 37

If there are delays in regulatory updates by governmental agencies to federal and state healthcare programs, we may experience increased volatility in our operating results as such delays may result in a timing difference between when such program revenues are earned and when they become known or estimable for purposes of accounting recognition.
 Our net patient revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, were 49.2%, 47.0% and 49.8% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The reimbursement payments related to these programs are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that can have a significant impact on our operating results. When delays occur in the passage of legislation, funding authorizations or the implementation of regulations, we could experience material increases or decreases in our revenues to be recognized in periods subsequent to when the related healthcare services were performed. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded net favorable (unfavorable) contractual allowance adjustments in net operating revenues of $2.2 million, $(0.3) million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to previous program reimbursement estimates and final cost report settlements. The volatility in the timing of recognition of adjustments to reimbursement payments under these programs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 Controls designed by third-party payors to reduce utilization of inpatient services may reduce our revenues.
 Over the last several years, third-party payors, including both governmental and non-governmental payors, have instituted policies and procedures to substantially reduce or limit coverage of inpatient healthcare services. Payors have implemented controls and procedures designed to monitor and reduce patient admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization review,” which have impacted and are expected to continue to impact inpatient admission volumes at our hospitals. Federal laws contain numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and hospital occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization requirements, payor-required post-admission utilization reviews and payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative delivery options for healthcare services for less acutely ill patients. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates by governmental and non-governmental third-party payors could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
 If we fail to comply with the extensive laws and governmental regulations that apply to the U.S. healthcare industry, including anti-fraud and abuse laws, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.
 The U.S. healthcare industry is governed by extensive laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels. These laws and regulations include standards that address, among other issues, the following:
  
• | the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, and operating policies and procedures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | billing and coding for services;
--+---------------------------------


• | proper handling of overpayments;
--+---------------------------------


• | classification of levels of care provided;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | preparing and filing of cost reports;
--+--------------------------------------


• | relationships with referral sources and referral recipients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | maintenance of adequate records;
--+---------------------------------


• | compliance with building codes;
--+--------------------------------


• | environmental protection;
--+--------------------------


• | privacy and security; and
--+--------------------------


• | debt collection and communications with patients and consumers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 Examples of these laws include, but are not limited to, HIPAA, the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, EMTALA and similar state laws. These laws are applicable to financial arrangements we have with physicians and other health care providers who refer patients to our hospitals, employed physicians and other health care services. The laws are quite complex and subject to varying interpretations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully offer to pay, solicit or receive any remuneration to induce referrals for services covered by a federal health care program, or to induce a person to arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of a service or item covered by a federal health care program. Because of the broad scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the OIG has enacted a number of safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. While we strive to comply with applicable safe harbors wherever possible, the safe harbors are narrowly tailored and certain arrangements, including joint ventures and other financial relationships with physicians and referrals sources, are not able to fit squarely within a safe harbor. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor, however, does not necessarily mean that that the Anti-
 38

Kickback Statute is violated or that an arrangement is illegal. Instead, the arrangement is measured against the statutory prohibition, which precludes, among other things, payments to induce, or in return, for referrals. Nevertheless, absent compliance with a safe harbor, we cannot guarantee that an arrangement would not be found to implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute.
 In addition, our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark law. Under the Stark Law, a broad prohibition is created and, unless the parties qualify for an exception, the referral and submission of claims for services provided pursuant to the referral is prohibited. While we attempt to structure all financial relationships with physicians and physician organizations to comply with an exception to the Stark law, the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and subject to varying interpretations. Therefore, we cannot provide a guarantee that every financial relationship with a physician complies fully with the Stark law. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark law is not an intent-based stated and, therefore, even an inadvertent or technical non-compliance may lead to a violation.
 One category of arrangements subject to the Stark law is physician-owned hospitals. We have three hospitals with physician ownership and, therefore, we must meet all requirements of the applicable exception to the Stark law known as the “whole hospital" exception. The exception generally permits a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, rather than holding an ownership interest in a department of the hospital, if all requirements of the exception are met. Changes were made to the Stark law as part of the Affordable Care Act that narrowed the applicability of the “whole hospital” exception to the Stark Law for new and existing physician-owned hospitals. As a result, the Stark law provided a “grandfathering” of existing physician ownership in hospitals if certain requirements continued to be met and the physicians did not increase the aggregate percentage of ownership in the hospitals. The physician-owned hospitals are subject to a prohibition of expansion of the facility capacity beyond the aggregate number of operating rooms, procedure rooms and beds for which the hospital was licensed as of March 23, 2010. The whole hospital exception also contains additional disclosure requirements that the hospital and physician owners must make to patients related to their ownership interests. If a physician-owned hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could be required to repay Medicare payments related to tainted referrals and could possibly lose its Medicare provider agreement. Tracking the required elements of the “whole hospital exception” is critical to maintaining these entities in compliance with the Stark law.
 The Civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) generally prohibits the knowing filing of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States or the knowing use of a false record or statement to obtain payment from the United States or a conspiracy to defraud the United States by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid. If we violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to be in violation of the FCA. Under the FCA a suit can be brought by the government, or by a private person under a qui tam, or "whistleblower" action on behalf of the government.
 If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil sanctions and criminal penalties, including the loss of our operating licenses and our ability to participate in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. There are heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state governmental agencies relating to the U.S. healthcare industry. Recent enforcement actions have focused on financial arrangements between hospitals and physicians, billing for services without adequately documenting medical necessity and billing for services outside the coverage guidelines for such services. Specific to our hospitals, we have received inquiries and subpoenas from various governmental agencies regarding these and other matters, and we are also subject to various claims and lawsuits relating to such matters. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a further discussion of these matters.
 In the future, evolving interpretations or enforcement of the laws and regulations applicable to the U.S. healthcare industry could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes to our healthcare facilities, equipment, personnel, healthcare service offerings, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses.
 We may be adversely affected by consolidation among health insurers and other industry participants.
 In recent years, a number of private health insurers have merged or increased efforts to consolidate with other non-governmental payors. Insurers are also increasingly pursuing alignment initiatives with healthcare providers. Consolidation within the health insurance industry may result in insurers having increased negotiating leverage and competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing data
. In addition, the trend within the U.S. healthcare industry toward value-based purchasing programs could be accelerated if the large private health insurance companies, including those engaging in consolidation activity, find these programs to be financially beneficial. Other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, may intensify competitive pressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict. We cannot predict whether we will be able to negotiate favorable terms and otherwise respond effectively to the impact of increased consolidation within the payor industry or vertical integration efforts.
 We may from time to time become the subject of legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings that, if resolved unfavorably, could have an adverse effect on us, and we may be subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown.
 We may from time to time become a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters. Those proceedings include, among other things, governmental investigations. In addition, we may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. 
 39

Addressing any investigations, lawsuits or other claims may distract management and divert resources, even if we ultimately prevail. Should an unfavorable outcome occur in some or all of any such current or future legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other such loss contingencies, or if successful claims and other actions are brought against us in the future, there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 Governmental investigations, as well as qui tam lawsuits, may lead to significant fines, penalties, settlements or other sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs. Settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments and corporate integrity agreements, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While CHS has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities relating to outcomes or events occurring prior to the closing of the Spin-off, we cannot guarantee that any such legal proceedings or loss contingencies will be covered by such indemnities or that CHS will fully indemnify us thereunder. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for additional information on legal proceedings to which we are subject.
 We could be subject to substantial uninsured liabilities or increased insurance costs as a result of significant legal actions.
 Physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice and other liability claims or legal theories. Even in states that have imposed caps on damage awards, plaintiffs are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages. Many of these actions involve large claims and significant costs for legal defense. To protect us from the vulnerability to the potentially significant costs arising from these claims, we maintain claims-made professional and general liability insurance coverage in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured. We believe the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient to cover potential losses of our operations. Our insurance coverage, however, may not continue to be available in the future at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. Additionally, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us, such as fines, penalties, or other damage and legal expense payments resulting from qui tam lawsuits. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal actions against us or the effect that judgments or settlements in such matters may have on us or on our insurance costs. Additionally, all professional and general liability insurance we purchase is subject to policy limitations. If the aggregate limit of any of our professional and general liability policies is exhausted, in whole or in part, it could deplete or reduce the limits available to pay any other material claims applicable to that policy period. Furthermore, one or more of our insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill its or their obligations to defend, pay or reimburse us when those obligations become due. In that case, or if payments of claims exceed our estimates or are not covered by our insurance, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although CHS has agreed to indemnify us for certain legal proceedings and our loss contingencies relating to outcomes or events occurring prior to the closing of the Spin-off, we cannot guarantee that any such legal proceedings or loss contingencies will be covered by such indemnities or that CHS will fully indemnify us thereunder.
 Our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.
 The operation of our information systems is essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including (i) accounting and financial reporting; (ii) billing and collecting accounts; (iii) coding and compliance; (iv) clinical systems; and (v) medical records and document storage. In general, information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. In addition, our business is at risk from and may be impacted by information security incidents, including ransomware, malware, and other electronic security events. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. These events can also result from internal compromises, such as human error or malicious acts. These events can occur on our systems or on the systems of our partners and subcontractors.
 We entered into various transition services agreements with CHS that define agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to us. The transition services agreements generally have terms of five years and include, among others, services related to information technology, payroll processing, and certain human resources functions. The majority of our information systems are managed by CHS under the terms of these agreements. We believe that CHS and our other subcontractors and vendors take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our business operations as a result of failure or disruption to their information systems. However, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a disruption, and it is possible that we may be impacted by information system failures. The occurrence of any information system failures could result in interruptions, delays, loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems. All of these events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and they could harm our business reputation.
 A cyber-attack or security breach could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential patient data, confidential corporate information, or critical systems and give rise to potential harm to patients, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law or other legal theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.
 We rely extensively on our computer systems and those of our third-party vendors to collect, store and manage clinical and financial data on our networks and devices, to communicate with our patients, payors, vendors and other third parties, and to summarize and analyze our operating results. Our networks and devices store sensitive information, including intellectual property, 
 40

proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients, partners and employees. As a result, cyber-security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, process and practices designed to protect our information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Our ability to recover from a ransomware, phishing, social engineering, hacking or other cyber-attack is dependent on these practices, including successful backup systems and other recovery procedures. We have made significant investments in technology to protect our systems and information from cyber-security risks. In partnership with CHS, one of our more significant third-party vendors, we have implemented security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber event.
 In particular, despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against our and our third-party vendor’s information systems and devices create risks of cybersecurity incidents. These risks include ransomware, malware, and other electronic security events and the resulting damage. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. They can also result from internal compromises, such as human error or malicious acts. Breaches of personal information can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. There can be no assurance that we, or our third-party vendors including CHS, will not be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. Such attacks or breaches could impact the integrity, availability or privacy of protected patient medical data or other information subject to privacy laws, or they could disrupt our information technology systems, medical devices or business, including our ability to provide various healthcare services. Additionally, growing cyber-security threats related to the use of ransomware, phishing and other malicious software threaten the access to, availability of, and utilization of critical information technology and data.
 As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. In addition, the healthcare industry is currently experiencing increased attention on compliance with regulations designed to safeguard protected health information and mitigate cyber-attacks on entities. There continues to be an increased level of attention focused on cyber-attacks on healthcare providers because of the vast amount of personally identifiable information these organizations possess. Most healthcare providers, including all who accept Medicare and Medicaid, must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, regulations regarding the privacy and security of protected health information. States also maintain laws focused in this area. The HIPAA regulations impose extensive administrative requirements with regard to how protected health information may be used and disclosed. Further, the regulations and similar state laws include extensive and complex provisions which require us to establish reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information maintained in electronic format. We must safeguard protected health information against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the information.
 We are obligated under HIPAA and state law to notify individuals and the government if personal information is compromised as defined by the law. In addition, the Secretary of HHS is required to perform periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. Further, in addition to activities by federal regulators, state attorneys general are also engaged in enforcement activities with respect to information security breaches.
 Violations of these various privacy and security laws can result in significant civil monetary penalties, as well as the potential for criminal penalties. In addition to state data breach notification requirements, HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions on behalf of affected state residents against entities that violate HIPAA’s privacy and security regulations. These penalties could be in addition to other penalties assessed by a state for a breach which would be considered reportable under the state’s data breach notification laws. Further, there are significant costs associated with a breach, including investigation costs, remediation and mitigation costs, notification costs, attorney fees, and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to a loss in confidence in the provider. We cannot predict the costs to comply with these laws or the costs associated with a potential breach of protected health information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and our business reputation.
 If we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could also result in harm to patients; business interruptions and delays; the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; reputational damage and federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 The industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.
 The trend toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services is gaining momentum across the U.S. healthcare industry among both governmental and commercial payors. Generally, value-based purchasing initiatives tie reimbursement payments to the quality and efficiency of patient care. For example, hospitals that fall into the lowest-performing 25% of national risk-adjusted Hospital Acquired Conditions (“HAC”) rates for all hospitals in the previous year are subject to a 1% reduction in their total Medicare 
 41

reimbursement payments. Further, hospitals do not receive Medicare reimbursement payments for care related to HACs. In addition, HHS reduces Medicare inpatient hospital reimbursement payments for all discharges by a required percentage, set at 2% for federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years, and pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards. Hospitals are also required to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 HHS has indicated that it is particularly focused on tying Medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models, which generally aim to make providers attentive to the quality and cost of care they deliver to patients. Examples of alternative payment models include ACOs and bundled payment arrangements. While participation in
 bundled payment programs is voluntary, CMS has indicated that it is developing more bundled payment models, although it is unclear whether they will successfully lead to increased coordination of care and cost containment. It is possible that the adoption of alternative payment models will decrease the aggregate reimbursements under federal and state healthcare programs.
 Several of the largest commercial insurance payors in the United States have also expressed the intent to increase reliance on value-based purchasing. Furthermore, many large commercial insurance payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.
 Notably, on October 9, 2019, both the OIG and CMS issued proposed rules that, if adopted, would create new exceptions to the Stark law and safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute for value-based arrangements that are intended to remove regulatory barriers under those laws to allow greater flexibility for care coordination and value-based models. While it is possible that these regulations, if adopted, could vary from the proposals, the proposals would be useful for protecting arrangements under both government and commercial payor value-based programs.
 We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement rates on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement payment amounts under both governmental and non-governmental programs and plans. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues, operating costs, or both.
 Certificate of need laws and regulations regarding licenses, ownership and operation may impair our future expansion or divestiture opportunities in some states. In states without certificate of need laws, our providers may face lower barriers to entry, but could also face increased competition from other providers.
 Some states require prior approval for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities based on the state’s determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. In addition, certain states in which we operate hospitals require a CON for, among other things, capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount and changes in bed capacity or healthcare service lines. We may not be able to obtain CONs required for expansion activities that we want to pursue in the future. In addition, we are required to maintain one or more licenses in all of the states in which we operate hospitals. If we fail to obtain a required CON or license, our ability to operate or expand our operations in those states could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if a CON or other prior approval upon which we relied to invest in construction of a replacement or expanded healthcare facility were to be revoked or lost through an appeal process, we may not be able to recover the value of our investment.
 Some states in which we operate do not require CONs for the purchase, construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services. Additionally, from time to time, states with existing requirements may repeal or limit the scope of their CON programs for future entry. In these cases, our competing healthcare providers could face lower barriers to entry and expansion into certain states where we operate hospitals. We could face decreased market share and revenues if competing healthcare providers are able to purchase, construct or expand healthcare facilities, without being subject to regulatory approval, into markets that are in close proximity to those in which we operate hospitals.
 Quorum Health Resources, while subject to various risk factors affecting its hospital industry clients, is subject to additional risks related to its unique business model.
 The various risk factors stated herein that could result in adverse impacts on the results of operations of our hospitals could similarly affect the hospital and other healthcare clients of our QHR business. Any negative impact on our QHR clients could result in defaults under or terminations of one or more of our contracts, or could result in our inability to attract new management advisory and consulting business. Furthermore, QHR could be subject to allegations of mismanagement, as well as assertions of participation in incidents of alleged malpractice in its position as a management advisor to certain hospital clients. It is possible that resolutions of these actions could require settlements from us that exceed the revenues received from the related hospital client, and this could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 Changes in tax laws or their interpretations, or becoming subject to additional federal, state or local taxes, could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state taxes such as income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount of our cash flow, and have a material 
 42

adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority which could increase our tax liabilities. If we are required to pay additional taxes, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Risks Related to the Spin-Off and Our Operations as an Independent Publicly Traded Company
 The utilization of our federal income tax loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.
 As of December 31, 2019, we had a federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward of approximately $267.6 million on a pre-tax basis available to offset future taxable income and have recorded a full valuation allowance on these federal NOL carryforwards. Any NOL arising in a taxable year ending before January 1, 2018 may only be carried forward for 20 taxable years following the taxable year of such loss. We have $166.1 million of NOLs that were created before January 1, 2018. Any NOL arising in a taxable year ending on or after January 1, 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, any NOL deduction with respect to an NOL arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited to 80% of our taxable income, computed without regard to the NOL deduction, in the year in which the deduction is taken. We have $101.5 million of NOLs with an indefinite carryforward. 
 Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) also imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a company’s taxable income that may be offset by the NOL carryforwards if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Code. An ownership change occurs when a company’s “5-percent shareholders,” as defined in Section 382 of the Code, collectively increase their ownership in a company by more than 50 percentage points, by value, over a rolling three-year period. This is different from a change in beneficial ownership under applicable securities laws. These ownership changes include purchases of common stock under share repurchase programs, a company’s offering of its stock, the purchase or sale of company stock by 5-percent shareholders, or the issuance or exercise of rights to acquire company stock. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use the NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the NOL carryforwards. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOL carryforwards that may not be realized.
 The enactment of the CARES Act in March 2020 provides that NOLs arising in a tax year beginning in 2018, 2019 or 2020 can be carried back five years and temporarily removes the 80% taxable income limitation to allow an NOL to fully offset income. Due to the recent enactment of this legislation, we continue to assess the potential impacts of this legislation on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The utilization of our state income tax loss carryforwards could be limited if we do not realize profits from our hospital operations to adequately offset these losses in the applicable states where they exist.
 As of December 31, 2019, we had state income tax loss carryforwards of approximately $754 million. We expect to be able to realize a small amount of our NOL carryforwards in certain states. In other states where we hope to improve our financial performance we cannot make assurances that we will be able to fully realize the tax benefit associated with these state NOL carryforwards. As a result, we have recorded a valuation allowance to offset all or a portion of the deferred tax asset created by the NOL carryforwards in those states. We could be required to record additional valuation allowance related to our state NOL carryforwards based upon our operating results in the future, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
 The utilization of our interest expense carryforward as calculated under the Tax Act could be limited in the future.
 We have generated an estimated $193.8 million of disallowed interest expense as calculated under the new interest expense limitation provisions defined in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. This disallowed amount creates a deferred tax asset that can be carried forward indefinitely. However, due to our significant amount of third party debt, we may not be able to deduct this carryforward in future tax years until we reduce our third party debt, generate significant amounts of income, or there is a change in the tax law.
 The Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.
 The Spin-off could be challenged under various state fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the Spin-off left CHS insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that CHS intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that CHS did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-off. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff that the Spin-off was a fraudulent transfer, then such court could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, avoidance of the transfer, an attachment or other provisional remedy against the asset transferred, an injunction against further disposition by the debtor or a transferee, or both, of the asset transferred, or any other relief the circumstances may require.
 The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if either the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the 
 43

amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), or it is unlikely to be able to pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that CHS was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.
 Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement with CHS, from and after the Spin-off, we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to our business. Although we do not expect to be liable for any of these or other obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by CHS should CHS fail to pay or perform its retained obligations. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock
 Our common stock is no longer traded on a national securities exchange and is quoted only in the over-the-counter market.
 In connection with the announcement of our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the NYSE suspended the trading of our shares of common stock on April 7, 2020 and determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE. Our common stock has commenced trading on OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol “QHCCQ.” However, the extent of the public market for our common stock and the continued availability of quotations would depend upon such factors as the aggregate market value of the common stock, the interest in maintaining a market in our common stock on the part of securities firms and other factors. The over-the-counter market is a significantly more limited market than the NYSE, and the quotation of our common stock in the over-the-counter market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our common stock.
 Trading in our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.
 All of our indebtedness is senior to the existing common stock in our capital structure. The RSA and the Plan contemplate that our existing equity interests will be cancelled and discharged in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the holders of those equity interests, including the holders of our common stock, will be entitled to no recovery. Accordingly, any trading in our common stock during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of our common stock.
 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control.
 Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, among other things, authorize our Board of Directors (the “Board”) to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit our shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders and provide that Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of legal proceedings initiated by our shareholders. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our Board, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock. 
 Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are required not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition of our common stock, issuance of our common stock or any other transaction or, to the extent we have the right to prohibit it, to permit any such transaction, that could cause the distribution of our common stock to CHS shareholders to be taxable. We also agreed to indemnify CHS for any tax resulting from any such transactions. Generally, CHS will recognize taxable gain on the distribution of our common stock if there are one or more acquisitions or issuances of our common stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of our then-outstanding common stock, and the acquisition or issuance is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution of common stock to CHS shareholders. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the Spin-off date, with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances, will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. As a result, our obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
 We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.
 We may terminate our Exchange Act reporting, if permitted by applicable law.
 If at any time our common stock is delisted and held by fewer than 300 holders of record, we will be permitted to cease to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act to the extent we are not otherwise required to continue to report pursuant to Section 15(d) 
 44

of the Exchange Act or any contractual agreements, including with respect to any of our indebtedness. If we were to cease filing reports under the Exchange Act, the information now available to our stockholders in the annual, quarterly and other reports we currently file with the SEC would not be available to them as a matter of right. As of April 2, 2020, there were 158 holders of record of our shares of our common stock.
