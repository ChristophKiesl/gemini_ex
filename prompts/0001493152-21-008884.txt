Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

 
Rennova Health, Inc. (“Rennova,” the “Company,” “we”, or “it”) is a provider of healthcare services for our patients. The Company’s business originally focused on diagnostics and healthcare software development. In late 2016, the Company decided to pursue the opportunity to acquire and operate clusters of rural hospitals and is currently focused on implementing this business model. The Company now owns one operating hospital, a hospital that it plans to reopen and operate, a physician’s office in Tennessee and a rural clinic in Kentucky. As the business focus has transitioned to rural hospital operations, the Company has been working to separate its software entities into its own public company and plans to sell its last clinical laboratory outside of its hospital labs, EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., and as a result the software entities’ and EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company’s operations now consist of only one business segment, Hospital Operations.
 
Hospital Operations
 
We believe that the acquisition or development of rural hospitals is a viable business strategy and will create a stable revenue base from provision of a needed service in rural America. Rural hospitals deliver a needed health care service and employment to communities that would otherwise have to travel an hour or more to alternative locations.
 
Our hospital operations began on August 8, 2017, following the receipt of the required licenses and regulatory approvals to open our first hospital in Oneida, Tennessee. They generated net revenues of approximately $7.2 million and approximately $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019, based on our revenue collection history achieved, management recognized an approximately 14% and 14% hospital collection rate against gross billing, respectively.

Scott County Community Hospital (DBA Big South Fork Medical Center)
 
On January 13, 2017, we closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to Scott County Community Hospital, based in Oneida, Tennessee (the “Oneida Assets”). The Oneida Assets include a 52,000 square foot hospital building and 6,300 square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. Scott County Community Hospital is classified as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) with 25 beds, a 24/7 emergency department, operating rooms and a laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services. Scott County Community Hospital closed in July 2016 in connection with the bankruptcy filing of its parent company, Pioneer Health Services, Inc. We acquired the Oneida Assets out of bankruptcy for a purchase price of $1.0 million. The hospital, which has been renamed Big South Fork Medical Center, became operational on August 8, 2017.
Jamestown Regional Medical Center
 
On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jamestown, Tennessee, referred to as Jamestown Regional Medical Center. The purchase was completed on June 1, 2018. The hospital operations were acquired by a newly-formed subsidiary, Jamestown TN Medical Center, Inc., and the hospital is an 85-bed facility of approximately 90,000 square feet on over eight acres of land, which offers a 24-hour Emergency Department with two spacious trauma bays and seven private exam rooms, inpatient and outpatient medical services and a Progressive Care Unit which provides telemetry services. The acquisition also included a separate physician practice known as Mountain View Physician Practice, Inc. Jamestown is located 38 miles west of our Big South Fork Medical Center. The Company suspended operations at the hospital in June 2019, as a result of the termination of its Medicare agreement. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening plans have also been disrupted by the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed but is expected to be initiated in mid-2021.
Jellico Medical Center
 
On March 5, 2019, the Company closed an asset purchase agreement whereby it acquired certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jellico, Tennessee known as Jellico Community Hospital and an outpatient clinic located in Williamsburg, Kentucky known as CarePlus Center. The hospital and the clinic and their associated assets were acquired from Jellico Community Hospital, Inc. and CarePlus Rural Health Clinic, LLC, respectively.
 
On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. The Company does not expect this closure to have an adverse effect on its business strategy and believes it will have a positive impact from a reduced cash requirement in the immediate future. Jellico Community Hospital was a 54-bed acute care facility that offered comprehensive services, including diagnostic imaging, radiology, surgery (general, gynecological and vascular), nuclear medicine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine, intensive care, emergency care and physical therapy. Jellico is located 33 miles east of our Big South Fork Medical Center. The CarePlus rural clinic in Kentucky offers sophisticated testing capabilities and compassionate care, all in a modern, patient-friendly environment. Services include diagnostic imaging services, x-ray, mammography, bone densitometry, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, physical therapy and laboratory services on a walk-in basis.


The purchase price was $658,537. This purchase price was made available by Christopher Diamantis, a former member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Diligence, legal and other costs associated with the acquisition were approximately $250,000, meaning the total cost of acquisition to the Company was approximately $908,000.
 
At March 31, 2021, the Company owns one operating hospital in Oneida, Tennessee, a rural clinic in Williamsburg, Kentucky and a closed hospital facility and doctors’ practice in Jamestown, Tennessee which it plans to reopen. The Company continues to expand its centralized hospital division management team in Knoxville, Tennessee and plans to secure adequate capital to stabilize and improve its management team and operations throughout 2021. The Company remains confident that its strategy to own and operate a number of rural hospitals in a close geographic location is a viable business strategy.

Discontinued Operations
 
Advanced Molecular Services and Health Technology Solutions, Inc.
 
On July 12, 2017, we announced plans to spin off our Advanced Molecular Services Group (“AMSG”) and in the third quarter of 2017 our Board of Directors voted unanimously to spin off the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health Technology Solutions, Inc. (“HTS”), as independent publicly traded companies by way of tax-free distributions to the Company’s stockholders. On June 10, 2020, the Company signed an agreement for the separation of these entities into a public company. The agreement with TPT Global Tech, Inc. (“TPT”) (OTC: TPTW), a California-based public company, was to merge HTS and AMSG into a public company after TPT completed a merger of its wholly-owned subsidiary, InnovaQor, Inc., with this public company. Rennova terminated its agreement with TPT on March 8, 2021 after numerous attempts to close the transaction as proposed failed due to uncertainty and last minute unviable demands from TPT that would have created a high risk to the future success of the project. Rennova is currently considering the actions of TPT with the belief that TPT acted outside of agreements that were in place and may have converted Rennova owned confidential information for their own benefit and business strategy. Rennova intends to pursue any remedy available to it under the law to recover money owed from TPT and to protect its technology and assets.
 
The Company continues to pursue options available to separate these entities and believes this can be accomplished in the second quarter of 2021. The strategic goal of this transaction is to create a separate public company which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans and create value for Rennova and its shareholders. The Company has reflected the amounts relating to AMSG and HTS (referred to as the AMSG & HTS Group) as deposal groups classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Clinical Diagnostics
 
Prior to our focus on hospital operations, our principal focus had been clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis on the provision of urine drug toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. This sector had been fraught with difficulties over the past number of years as payers reduced reimbursement and coverage for diagnostics in this sector. The lack of consistency between payer’s policies and their requirement for proof of medical necessity created uncertainty for ordering physicians and testing laboratories and their ability to receive payment. During 2018, we reduced the number of laboratories we operated to one facility operated by EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. in Palm Beach County, Florida. During the third quarter of 2020, we announced that we had reached a tentative agreement to sell EPIC Reference Labs, Inc., to TPT and as a result EPIC Reference Labs, Inc.’s operations have been classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements. This proposed sale was terminated by Rennova on March 10, 2021, along with a lab management agreement and other permissions that had been granted by Rennova to TPT. Rennova is owed certain payments under the agreements and intends to take the necessary actions to secure payments owed by TPT.
 
History and Development of the Company
 
Rennova Health, Inc. is the result of a merger between two public companies, Medytox Solutions, Inc. and CollabRx, Inc., in November 2015.
 
Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) was organized on July 20, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first half of 2011, Medytox’s management elected to reorganize as a holding company, and Medytox established and acquired a number of companies in the medical diagnostics service and healthcare software sector between 2011 and 2014.
 
On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among CollabRx, Inc. (“CollabRx”), CollabRx Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx formed for the purpose of the merger, and Medytox, Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx (the “Merger”). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Rennova Health, Inc. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, as such, the historical financial statements of Medytox became the historical financial statements of the Company.
 
Recent and Other Developments
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On July 30, 2020, the Company filed an Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation in order to effect a 1-for-10,000 reverse stock split of the Company’s shares of common stock effective on July 31, 2020. On May 7, 2020, the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the Company’s securities approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of all of the Company’s shares of common stock at a specific ratio within a range from 1-for-100 to 1-for-10,000, and granted authorization to the Board of Directors to determine in its discretion the specific ratio and timing of the reverse split on or prior to December 31, 2020. The Board approved the specific ratio and timing on July 22, 2020.

5
-


As a result of the reverse stock split, every 10,000 shares of the Company’s pre-reverse split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of the Company’s common stock. Proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the reverse stock split, other than as a result of the cash payment for any fractional shares that would have otherwise been issued. Stockholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of common stock received a cash payment in respect of such fraction of a share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split.
 
The reverse stock split became effective at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on July 31, 2020 and the Company’s common stock continued to trade on a post-split basis at the open of business on August 3, 2020. The Company’s post-reverse split common stock has a new CUSIP number, but the par value and other terms of the common stock were not affected by the reverse stock split, except that, for the first 20 days after the reverse split, the common stock traded under the symbol “RNVAD”. It currently trades under our existing symbol “RNVA”. Prior to the reverse split, the Company had approximately 9.9 billion shares of common stock outstanding, which resulted in approximately 990,000 post-split shares.
 
All outstanding preferred shares, stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans immediately prior to the reverse stock split have generally been appropriately adjusted by dividing the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred shares, stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans were exercisable or convertible by 10,000 and multiplying the exercise or conversion price by 10,000, as a result of the reverse stock split.
 
Voting Agreement
 
On August 13, 2020, Christopher Diamantis, a former member of the Company’s Board of Directors, entered into a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy (the “Voting Agreement”) with the Company, Mr. Lagan and Alcimede LLC (of which Mr. Lagan is the sole manager) pursuant to which Mr. Diamantis granted an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Lagan to vote the Series M Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series M Preferred Stock”) held by Mr. Diamantis, Mr. Diamantis has retained all other rights under the Series M Preferred Stock. Regardless of the number of shares of Series M Preferred Stock outstanding and so long as at least one share of Series M Preferred Stock is outstanding, the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock shall have the number of votes, in the aggregate, equal to 51% of all votes entitled to be voted at any meeting of stockholders or action by written consent. This means that the holders of Series M Preferred Stock have sufficient votes, by themselves, to approve or defeat any proposal voted on by the Company’s stockholders, unless there is a supermajority required under applicable law or by agreement.
Exchange of Debentures and Preferred Stock
 
On August 31, 2020, the Company entered into the Exchange, Redemption and Forbearance Agreement (the “Exchange and Redemption Agreement”) with certain institutional investors in the Company. In the Exchange and Redemption Agreement, the investors agreed to reduce their holdings of the Company’s debentures by approximately $19.3 million (including accrued interest and penalties) by exchanging the debentures and all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Series I-1Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series I-1 Preferred Stock”) and Series I-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series I-2 Preferred Stock”) for 30,435 shares of the Company’s newly-authorized Series N Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series N Preferred Stock”). The terms of the Series N Preferred Stock are set forth in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Mr. Diamantis is also a party to the Exchange and Redemption Agreement as he continues to be a guarantor of a portion of the remaining debt.
 
The investors continued to own, after the initial exchange, approximately $14.9 million (including accrued interest and penalties) of debentures, but agreed that the Company could redeem $10 million of its obligations under these debentures held by the investors at face value, plus accrued interest and penalties. These debentures include approximately $5.0 million under debentures that have been guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis. This redemption right was exercisable for 90 days after August 31, 2020. If it had been exercised in full, the remaining debentures held by the investors (totaling approximately $4.9 million, including accrued interest and penalties) would have been exchanged for approximately 4,900 additional shares of Series N Preferred Stock.

-


During the 90-day redemption period (or until the occurrence of certain specified events, if earlier), the investors agreed to forbear from exercising any remedies against the Company or Mr. Diamantis as a result of any existing defaults under the outstanding securities. During that period, additional interest and penalties did not accrue and would have been forgiven if the redemption right was exercised in full. The redemption right was not exercised and all such additional amounts have become due and payable. The Exchange and Redemption Agreement is more fully discussed in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Financial Results
 
Our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $17.6 million, as compared to a loss of $46.6 million for the same period of a year ago. The improvement was primarily due to other income (expense), net of approximately $5.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to other income (expense), net of ($9.3) million in 2019, a $0.7 million net gain from legal settlements and a $2.0 million gain from the extinguishment of debt in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease in interest expense of $11.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019 and a $1.3 million income tax benefit in the year ended December 31, 2020. Partially offsetting the improvement in our net loss was an increase in the loss from continuing operations before other income (expense) and income taxes of $1.5 million.
Outlook
 
We believe that the transition of our business model from diagnostics is now complete and once stabilized will create more predictable and stable revenue. Rural hospitals provide a much-needed service to their local communities and reduce our reliance on commission-based sales employees to generate sales. We currently operate one hospital and a rural clinic in the same general geographic location and we own another hospital and physicians’ office at which operations are currently suspended. Owning a number of facilities in the same geographic location will create numerous efficiencies in purchasing and staffing and will enable the provision of additional, specialized and more valuable services that are needed by rural communities but cannot be sustained by a standalone rural hospital. We remain confident that this is a sustainable model we can continue to grow through acquisition and development and believe that we can benefit from the compliance and IT and software capabilities we already have in place. The progress of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is more fully discussed below, has severely affected our operations and may cause such expectations not to be achieved or, even if achieved, not to be done in the expected timeframe.
 
Impact of the Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. We have been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and we have taken steps intended to minimize the risk to our employees and patients. These steps have increased our costs and our revenues have been significantly adversely affected. Demand for hospital services has substantially decreased. As noted in Notes 1 and 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have received Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans (“PPP Notes”) as well as Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Provider Relief Funds from the federal government. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for a further extended period, we expect to incur significant losses and additional financial assistance may be required. Going forward, we are unable to determine the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business. The nature and effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our balance sheet and results of operations will depend on the severity and length of the pandemic in our service areas; government activities to mitigate the pandemic’s effect; regulatory changes in response to the pandemic, especially those affecting rural hospitals; and existing and potential government assistance that may be provided.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic and the steps taken by governments to seek to reduce its spread have severely impacted the economy and the health care industry in particular. Hospitals have especially been affected. Small rural hospitals, such as ours, may be overwhelmed by patients if conditions worsen in their local areas. Staffing costs, and concerns due to the potential exposure to infections, may increase, as may the costs of needed medical supplies necessary to keep the hospitals open. Doctors and patients may defer elective procedures and other health care services. Travel bans, social distancing and quarantines may limit access to our facilities. Business closings and layoffs in our local areas may result in the loss of insurance and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services as rendered.
 
Hospitalizations in Tennessee for COVID-19 increased throughout 2020 and appear to have peaked in December 2020. From third-party information there have been 822,085 cases and 12,001 deaths as of April 12, 2021. The roll out of vaccinations is expected to significantly reduce the risk of death and reduce transmission of the virus and a return to more normal expectations is expected throughout 2021. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company and the operations of our hospitals. Our plans to reopen our Jamestown Regional Medical Center, whose operations were suspended in June 2019, have been disrupted by the pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed.

On September 14, 2020, the Company announced that it had purchased and taken delivery of equipment to provide rapid testing for COVID-19 at Jellico Community Hospital, CarePlus Center and Big South Fork Medical Center in an effort to provide the Company with an additional revenue stream. On March 1, 2021, the Company closed Jellico Community Hospital, after the City of Jellico issued a 30-day termination notice for the lease of the building. The Company does not expect this closure to have an adverse effect on its business strategy and believes it will have a positive impact from a reduced cash requirement in the immediate future.
 
Competition
 
The healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients, affiliations with physicians and acquisitions. The most significant competition our hospitals, and any other hospitals we may acquire, face comes from hospitals that provide more complex services, and other healthcare providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that also compete for patients. Our hospitals, our competitors, and other healthcare industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as acquiring physician practice groups, employing physicians and participating in accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) or other clinical integration models, which may impact our competitive position. In addition, increasing consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may impact our ability to contract with payors on favorable terms and otherwise affect our competitive position.
Governmental Regulation
 
Overview
 
The healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and there continue to be federal and state proposals that would, and actions that do, impose limitations on government and private payments to providers. In addition, there regularly are proposals to increase co-payments and deductibles from program and private patients. Facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay. Such controls include what is commonly referred to as “utilization review”. Utilization review entails the review of a patient’s admission and course of treatment by a third party. Historically, utilization review has resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed. Utilization review is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by Medicare and Medicaid and is also required under many managed care arrangements.
 
Many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, additional measures that are designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. Various states have applied, or are considering applying, for a waiver from current Medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their Medicaid participants through managed care providers. These proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured, and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals, physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under Medicaid.
 
Healthcare Facility Regulation
 
Certificate of Need Requirements
 
A number of states require approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare services. Certificates of Need (“CONs”), which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities, are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters. Tennessee, the state in which we currently own our hospitals, has a CON law that applies to such facilities. States periodically review, modify and revise their CON laws and related regulations. Any violation of state CON laws can result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. We are unable to predict whether our hospitals will be able to obtain any CONs that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. In addition, future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that require CONs.
 
Future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that do not require CONs or which have less stringent CON requirements than the state in which Rennova currently owns hospitals. Any healthcare facility operated by the Company in such states may face increased competition from new or expanding facilities operated by competitors, including physicians.

Utilization Review Compliance and Hospital Governance
 
Healthcare facilities are subject to, and are required to comply with, various forms of utilization review. In addition, under the Medicare prospective payment system, each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of Medicare patient admissions, treatments and discharges in hospitals. Medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility, are overseen by each healthcare facility’s local governing board, the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members, and are reviewed by quality assurance personnel. The local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care, develop long-range plans, establish, review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
 
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is a federal law that requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program, the Medicaid program or both. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. Although we believe that we comply with EMTALA, we cannot predict whether the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) will implement new requirements in the future and whether we will be able to comply with any new requirements.
General Healthcare Regulations
 
Drugs and Controlled Substances
 
Various licenses and permits are required by our hospitals to dispense narcotics. They are required to register our dispensing operations for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with certain operating and security standards of, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), state health departments and other state agencies.
 
Fraud and Abuse, Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Regulations
 
Participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing our businesses, our participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. For example, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs if it:
 

● | makes claims to Medicare and/or Medicaid for services not provided or misrepresents actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | pays money to induce the referral of patients or the purchase of items or services where such items or services are reimbursable under a federal or state health program; 
● | fails to report or repay improper or excess payments; or 
● | fails to provide appropriate emergency medical screening services to any individual who comes to a hospital’s campus or otherwise fails to properly treat and transfer emergency patients.

Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the federal Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) and other governmental fraud and abuse programs and the OIG has issued and periodically updated compliance program guidance for hospitals. Each federal fiscal year, the OIG also publishes a General Work Plan that provides a brief description of the activities that the OIG plans to initiate or continue with respect to the programs and operations of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and details the areas that the OIG believes are prone to fraud and abuse.
 
Sections of the Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “anti-kickback” statute, prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare or other healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by Medicare or other government programs. Sanctions for violating the anti-kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. HHS has issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti-kickback statute. A given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal; however, business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal statutes that are not related to receipt of payments from a federal healthcare program. HIPAA created civil penalties for proscribed conduct, including upcoding and billing for medically unnecessary goods or services. These laws cover all health insurance programs, private as well as governmental. In addition, HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws, such as the anti-kickback statute, to include not just Medicare and Medicaid services, but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program. Finally, HIPAA established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse. These mechanisms include a bounty system where a portion of the payment recovered is returned to the government agencies, as well as a whistleblower program, where a portion of the payment received is paid to the whistleblower. HIPAA also expanded the categories of persons that may be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
 
There is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities, the OIG, the courts and the U.S. Congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient-care referrals and opportunities. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction and to reinterpret the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. Enforcement actions have increased, as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities.
 
In addition, provisions of the Social Security Act, known as the Stark Act, also prohibit physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements. Certain exceptions are available for employment agreements, leases, physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements. A person making a referral, or seeking payment for services referred, in violation of the Stark Act is subject to civil monetary penalties; restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims; and/or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare program, which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs.
 
Further, if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity, and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity, then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty. Compliance with and the enforcing of penalties for violations of these laws and regulations is changing and increasing. For example, CMS has issued a “self-referral disclosure protocol” for hospitals and other providers that wish to self-disclose potential violations of the Stark Act and attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute. In light of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that created potential liabilities under the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) for failing to report and repay known overpayments and return an overpayment within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, hospitals and other healthcare providers are encouraged to disclose potential violations of the Stark Act to CMS. It is likely that self-disclosure of Stark Act violations will increase in the future. Finally, many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the Medicaid program, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws
 
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits providers from, among other things, knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly, and while simple negligence generally will not give rise to liability, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity can constitute the “knowing” submission of a false or fraudulent claim for the purposes of the False Claims Act. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of “whistleblower” lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, the defendant will generally not be aware of the lawsuit until the government makes a determination whether it will intervene and take a lead in the litigation. If a provider is found to be liable under the False Claims Act, the provider may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties for each separate false claim. The government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality.
HIPAA Transaction, Privacy and Security Requirements
 
HIPAA and federal regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA contain, among other measures, provisions that have required the Company to implement modified or new computer systems, employee training programs and business procedures. The federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry, provide for the confidentiality and privacy of patient healthcare information and ensure the security of healthcare information.
 
A violation of the HIPAA regulations could result in civil money penalties per standard violated. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information, up to five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses and up to ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Since there is limited history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time, it is difficult to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the HIPAA regulations or the potential for fines and penalties, which may result from any violation of the regulations.
 
HIPAA Privacy Regulations
 
HIPAA privacy regulations protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. The regulations provide increased patient control over medical records, mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient’s right to privacy and, with a few exceptions, require that an individual’s individually identifiable health information only be used for healthcare-related purposes. These privacy standards apply to all health plans, all healthcare clearinghouses and all healthcare providers, such as our hospitals, that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with standard transactions, and apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form. These standards impose extensive administrative requirements on our hospitals and require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of such health information, and they require our facilities to impose these rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on our behalf. In addition, our hospitals are subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary by state and could impose stricter standards and additional penalties.
 
The HIPAA privacy regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards. We believe all of our facilities are in compliance with current HIPAA privacy regulations.
 
HIPAA Electronic Data Standards
 
The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange. These provisions are intended to streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. Among other things, these provisions require us to use standard data formats and code sets established by HHS when electronically transmitting information in connection with certain transactions, including health claims and equivalent encounter information, healthcare payment and remittance advice and health claim status.

The HHS regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions. The uniform data transmission standards are designed to enable healthcare providers to exchange billing and payment information directly with the many payors thereby eliminating data clearinghouses and simplifying the interface programs necessary to perform this function. We believe that our management information systems comply with HIPAA’s electronic data regulations and standards.
 
HIPAA Security Standards
 
The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of a series of security standards for the protection of electronic health information. The HIPAA security standards rule specifies a series of administrative, technical and physical security procedures for covered entities to use to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. The standards are delineated into either required or addressable implementation specifications. We believe we are in compliance with all the aspects of the HIPAA security regulations.
HIPAA National Provider Identifier
 
HIPAA also required HHS to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals, employers, health plans and healthcare providers to be used in connection with standard electronic transactions. All healthcare providers, including our hospitals, were required to obtain a new National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) to be used in standard transactions instead of other numerical identifiers by May 23, 2007. Our hospitals implemented use of a standard unique healthcare identifier by utilizing their employer identification number. HHS has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for unique health identifiers for health plans or individuals. Once these regulations are issued in final form, we expect to have approximately one to two years to become fully compliant, but cannot predict the impact of such changes at this time. We cannot predict whether our facilities may experience payment delays during the transition to the new identifiers. HHS is currently working on the standards for identifiers for health plans; however, there are currently no proposed timelines for issuance of proposed or final rules. The issuance of proposed rules for individuals is on hold indefinitely.
Medical Waste Regulations
 
Our operations, especially our hospitals, generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our operations are also generally subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Based on our current level of operations, we do not anticipate that such compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.
Compliance Program
 
The Company continuously evaluates and monitors its compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other rules and regulations. The objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement and update compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.
 
The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its operations. The health care industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusions from participation in government health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, necessary to operate as well as potential liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Professional Liability
 
As part of our business, our hospitals are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of operations. To cover a portion of these claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance are maintained in amounts which are commercially available and believed to be sufficient for operations as currently conducted, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect.
Environmental Regulation
 
We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. To date, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or competitive position. Similarly, we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations.
Payment for Services
 
In each of 2020 and 2019, the Company’s Hospital Operations derived over 42% and 56% of their net sales directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company’s Hospital Operations depend significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs. In recent years, both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health care costs, including reducing reimbursement for services.
 
Following an inspection at Jamestown Regional Medical Center on February 5, 2019, the hospital was informed on February 15 that several conditions of participation in its Medicare agreement were deficient. The hospital was informed that if the deficiencies were not corrected by May 16 the Medicare agreement would terminate. A follow-up inspection on May 15 resulted in the determination that the hospital had failed to adequately correct the deficiencies highlighted and a notice of involuntary termination was issued that was effective on June 12, 2019. A significant percentage of patients at Jamestown Regional Medical Center are covered by Medicare and without any ability to get paid for these services the Company suspended operations at the hospital. On June 10, 2019 the Company hired a new CEO to oversee the reopening of the hospital and took steps to re-enter the Medicare program. The Company plans to reopen the hospital upon securing adequate capital to do so. The reopening has also been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of the reopening has been delayed.
 
Further healthcare reform could occur in 2021, including changes to the Affordable Care Act and Medicare reform, initiatives to address surprise billing and increased price transparency, as well as administrative requirements that may affect coverage, reimbursement and utilization of our hospitals and laboratory in ways that are currently unpredictable.
 
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2021, we have 93 employees for our continuing operations, of which 63 are full time. Of our total employees from continuing operations, 3 are assigned to corporate administration and 90 are assigned to our Hospital Operations. In addition, we have 91 employees associated with our discontinued operations, including 86 that were still employed on March 15, 2021 and that were associated with Jellico Community Hospital, which was closed on March 1, 2021. We continue to adjust our number of employees to achieve efficiencies and cost savings where applicable.
