Overview
We are a leading provider of integrated data and technology solutions to the automotive, heavy truck, recreation and heavy equipment industries. Focused on enabling end-to-end, omnichannel retail commerce through open, agnostic technology, we provide solutions to dealers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), serving nearly 15,000 retail locations in North America. Our solutions connect people with technology by automating and integrating all parts of the dealership and buying process, including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, parts supply, repair and maintenance of vehicles.
We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology solutions for our core customer base of automotive retailers as well as to retailers and manufacturers of heavy trucks, construction equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats, and other marine and recreational vehicles.
Our Strategy
To enable end-to-end automotive commerce, our strategy is to invest for the long-term in integrated software products and an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, workflow-driven solutions for our customers. The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is growing: consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience when purchasing or servicing vehicles; OEMs see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail networks; and retailers are seeking integrated workflow technology solutions to help them improve both customer satisfaction and dealership cost structure. We believe that the best way to compete in a world with numerous providers of unconnected software solutions for numerous automotive retailers, OEMs, consumers, and vehicles is to provide integrated technology solutions and platform tools that can connect the disparate elements to create continuous retail workflows.
Our Business
We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology solutions for automotive retailers in North America. We are focused on the use of software-as-a-service "SaaS" and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our flagship Dealer Management System ("DMS") software solutions are hosted enterprise resource planning applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail automotive industry. Our DMS products facilitate the sale of 
new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. We also provide a broad portfolio of layered software applications and services, a robust and secure interface to the DMS through our Partner Program, data management and business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions. These solutions enable company-wide accounting, financial reporting, cash flow management, and payroll services. Our DMSs are typically integrated with OEM data processing systems that enable automotive retailers to order vehicles and parts, receive vehicle records, process warranties, and check recall campaigns and service bulletins while helping them to fulfill their franchisee responsibilities to their OEM franchisers.
Complementary to our core DMS, we also provide a portfolio of layered software applications and services to address the unique needs of automotive retail workflows. These solutions are often integrated to and targeted at users of our DMSs, but may, in some cases, be provided to customers that do not otherwise use our DMS. Our principal layered applications are:

Solutions | Description 
Vehicle Sales Solutions | Technology tools and services to streamline the entire vehicle inventory, sales, and finance and insurance ("F&I") process 
Fixed Operations Solutions | Solutions to manage the parts and service profit center of dealerships, including customer targeting, appointment scheduling, on-site workflow, and billing
Customer Relationship Management Solutions | Software to manage interactions with current and prospective customers 
Financial Management Solutions | Value-added capabilities for accounts payable, payments, and payroll 
Document Management Solutions | Document creation and archiving solutions to address the complex automotive retail sales process 
Network Management Solutions | Wired and wireless network solutions to support dealer connectivity and security efforts 
Integrated Telephony Management Solutions | Integrated telephony solutions that allow automotive retailers to connect and communicate via presence, instant messaging, voice, and video 

In recent years, we have strategically focused on delivering solutions that remove friction from the vehicle-buying experience. Specifically, we digitized critical pieces of the sales process with products such as Connected Store, ELEAD1ONE ("ELEAD") customer relationship management ("CRM"), Digital Contracting and eSign. On an as-needed basis, we have also implemented installation procedures for our DMS and layered application products on a fully remote basis to meet the needs of our dealers. As a result of certain safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw increased demand for our digital solution that can facilitate remote delivery and touchless transaction products. Our June 2021 acquisition of Roadster, Inc. now gives us capabilities to enable dealers to sell new and used vehicles completely online, while also giving consumers the option to begin and end the vehicle-buying process anywhere they choose—online or in-store.
We further connect the automotive ecosystem by providing third party retail solution providers with robust and secure interfaces to the core DMS through our Partner Program. For both automotive retailers and OEMs, we provide data management and business intelligence solutions through our open Neuron intelligent data platform that extract, cleanse, normalize, enhance, and distribute billions of pieces of industry information and turn it into usable data that provides actionable insights and products.
We offer automotive retailers and OEMs a variety of professional services, custom programming, consulting, implementation and training solutions, as well as a full range of customer support solutions. We also provide solutions to retailers and manufacturers of heavy trucks, construction equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats, and other marine and recreational vehicles.
Product Development and Innovation
Our ability to strengthen and extend our solutions portfolio is a key element of our business strategy. We execute on this strategy through a combination of development and the selective pursuit of strategic acquisitions. 
In addition to the ongoing investment to enhance existing solutions in our core business, we also invest in long- and medium-term product innovation aligned with our strategy. For example, the Fortellis Automotive Commerce Exchange ("Fortellis") is the foundation of our open technology platform for automotive commerce. In the automotive commerce market, Fortellis allows us and third parties to develop adaptive and interchangeable application programming interfaces ("APIs") that can be used to connect existing technology solutions and build new solutions quickly and with high levels of reliability. Similarly, we have developed our open Neuron intelligent data platform, which uses an analytics engine powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to create real-time and predictive insights that empower dealers and OEMs to sell and service more vehicles by creating personalized and differentiated customer experiences. The Neuron platform is available through Fortellis via our open APIs where it can best accelerate the creation of new products in the industry and enhance the user experience and value of existing products. We are developing these solutions using a methodical and measured approach with respect to capital and resource allocation. We believe these investments align to our strategy and will position us to take advantage of the evolving automotive retail market. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with a broad and diverse range of information, technology, services, and consulting companies, as well as with the in-house capabilities of OEMs and dealers. Our competitors range from local providers to regional and global competitors. However, we believe that no competitor provides the same combination of customer focus and breadth of solutions that we do.
Each of our solutions faces competition from an array of solution providers. For our DMS solutions in North America, our principal competitors are Reynolds and Reynolds, Dealertrack (Cox Automotive), Auto/Mate, AutoSoft, Tekion, PBS Systems, and various local and regional providers. The most significant competitive factors that we face across our solutions are price, breadth of features and functionality, user experience, quality, brand, scalability, and service capability.
Regulation 
The automotive retail industry is highly regulated and automotive retailers and OEMs are subject to a broad array of complex regulations governing virtually every aspect of their operations. Our customers must ensure their compliance with their regulatory requirements, and, in turn, we must ensure that our solutions effectively address their regulatory compliance needs.
Because our business delivers solutions across a broad spectrum of automotive retailer operations, our activities are impacted by a wide variety of federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. Central to the value of our DMS application, for example, is that the forms we provide for our customers meet the requirements of their applicable laws. Likewise, in our Vehicle Sales Solutions application, our electronic vehicle registration service is dependent on our compliance with complex and detailed regulatory requirements. Across our portfolio of automotive retail solutions, we are focused on ensuring that we meet our regulatory compliance obligations and that our solutions enable our customers to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to them. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters" for additional information regarding the application and impact of laws and regulations on our operations.
Privacy and Data Protection Regulations
We are subject to a number of federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding data governance and the privacy and protection of personal data. For example, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLB Act"), automotive retailers are generally deemed to be regulated financial institutions and therefore are subject to the GLB Act and applicable regulations, including the Federal Trade Commission's ("FTC") Privacy Rule and Safeguards Rule. In our capacity as a service provider to automotive retailers, we generally commit to our customers that we will handle non-public personal information consistent with the GLB Act and the related regulations. Similarly, many United States ("U.S.") states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted regulations that impose obligations on businesses that handle personal information, including notification requirements in the event of data breaches relating to personal data, as well as minimum security standards with respect to the handling and transmission of personal data. For a discussion of privacy and data protection regulation and the potential impacts on our business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters."
Seasonality
Though our business is not highly cyclical, a portion of it is seasonal. Our Transaction revenue experiences volatility around seasonal consumer vehicle shopping activity, and our Other revenue has a seasonal increase in the third quarter of each fiscal year related to the services we provide to dealers in support of their year-end reporting and tax filing obligations.
Concentrations
We maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company maintains deposits in a diversified group of financial institutions, has not experienced any losses to date, and monitors the credit ratings of the primary depository institutions where deposits reside. 
For fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, no customer represented 10% or more of our accounts receivable. 
Human Capital Resources
Our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our success in delivering high quality and innovative products and solutions for our customers and driving operational excellence is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our team.
We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to our long-term success. Our values – Be Open, Stay Curious, Own It and Create Possibilities represent who we are and how we show up for each other and our stakeholders. These values inspire our employee experience and the connection our employees have with the resources and tools to learn, grow and perform. We continue to make significant investments in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is crucial to deliver for our customers.
The following are some of the investments we make in our employees, to align with our key priorities:
•Diversity and Inclusion ("D&I"). Our D&I strategy embodies our continuous focus around increasing representation, embracing an inclusive culture, and positively impacting our communities. We foster an inclusive culture that creates a sense of belonging for employees, no matter their ethnicity, gender, race, physical abilities or preferences. This inclusive culture encourages employees to embrace different views which fuels innovation, sparks growth, increases productivity and enables the delivery of best-in-class service to our customers. Our employee-led impact teams support the activation of our D&I and Corporate Responsibility efforts across the organization to engage employees and deliver on our commitments. During fiscal 2021, we launched a required Ignite Inclusion learning journey for all people leaders to continue cultivating this inclusive culture that will help CDK and our customers win. To embed accountability for these efforts, our D&I efforts are reflected in a component of our fiscal 2021 bonus plan for all eligible employees.
•Thrive Continuous Performance Management ("THRIVE"). At CDK, we believe that everyone plays a distinct role in contributing to our business objectives. We empower our people to achieve their highest performance and potential by building a culture of high-performing teams and growth. We enable everyone to learn, grow, perform and accomplish tough goals. With THRIVE, employees own their performance and career by aligning performance and development objectives with business priorities, and crowd sourcing feedback all throughout the year. Employees and managers check in regularly to reflect on what’s gone well, what could go better and how they are tracking against their goals. At year end, employees and managers collaborate to conduct a year-end performance assessment that encapsulates both performance achievements and demonstration of behaviors in line with our values.
•Pulse Real-Time Engagement ("PULSE"). Employee engagement is the connection that creates discretionary effort and commitment to the organization, our colleagues and our customers. At CDK, employee engagement is a top priority for us. We strive to Be Open, and one way we live this value is by providing employees with opportunities to share their feedback. The insights we gain through weekly PULSE feedback is how we measure progress and share anonymous feedback with people leaders who are empowered to take action to strengthen engagement in their teams. Through PULSE, we are consistently evaluating how our people feel about our organizational priorities including engagement, D&I, and health and well-being drivers.
•Learning and Development. We Stay Curious by enabling a culture of continuous learning and growth. CDK offers a variety of learning and development programs and technologies that enhance our ability to connect employees with meaningful learning content. We offer a variety of learning opportunities including technical learning paths, professional skill development, and leadership development programming. Our partnership with EdAssist reimburses employees for tuition costs for career-enhancing education. We have also invested in LinkedIn Learning licenses for all CDK employees, offering more than 16,000 learning items for employees to connect with throughout their unique journey.
•Health and safety. We are committed to providing a healthy environment and safe workplace by operating in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities while maintaining an enhanced health and safety compliance program. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have modified practices at our offices to adhere to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network. We have made investments to provide oversight, enhance coordination and ensure robust safety protocols 
are present across our operations. We believe that a healthy and safe workforce is an engaged workforce that is ready and able to contribute to our success. In fiscal 2021, we added Health and Wellbeing questions to our PULSE survey to continuously assess the mental and social well being of our employees in real-time.
As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of approximately 6,500 employees. We believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We have statutory employee representation obligations with our Canadian employees.
