DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Our Company
 
We are in the business of developing, producing, marketing and selling raw materials, white label products and end consumer products containing the industrial hemp plant extract, Cannabidiol (“CBD”). We sell to numerous consumer markets including the botanical, beauty care, pet care and functional food sectors. We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of industrial hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. The development of products in this highly regulated industry carries significant risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure that we will successfully market and sell our products or, if we are able to do so, that we can achieve sales volume levels that will allow us to cover our fixed costs.
 
The Company primarily conducts its business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Steam Distribution, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Steam Distribution”), One Hit Wonder, Inc., a California corporation (“One Hit Wonder”), Havz, LLC, d/b/a Steam Wholesale, a California limited liability company (“Steam Wholesale”), and One Hit Wonder Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company (“OHWH”, and collectively known with Steam Distribution, One Hit Wonder, and Steam Wholesale as “HAVZ Consolidated”); SWCH LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“SWCH”); Trunano Labs, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Trunano”); Infusionz LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Infusionz”); and Cresco Management, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Cresco”).

Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, supplements and much more - an impressive scope for such a historically misunderstood and restricted commodity. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase exponentially over the next five years2, and we believe Grove is well positioned to take advantage of this growth in the hemp industry.
 
In the U.S., hemp products that are manufactured by Grove are regulated by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture and various agencies within the individual States.  As an initial matter, the hemp products manufactured and distributed by Grove must meet the requirements of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (the “Farm Bill”).  Under the Farm Bill, all hemp products must contain no more than 0.3% of 9-delta-tetraydrocannabidiols (“9-delta”) on a dry weight basis. To ensure compliance with this section, Grove requires that all hemp products it manufactures and distributes to contain no more than 0.3% of all tetraydrocannabidiols not simply 9-delta. The Farm Bill also requires that Grove only use hemp that are duly licensed under state law or pursuant to the regulations issued by the USDA. Consequently, the Company processes, develops, manufactures, and sells its products pursuant to the Farm Bill. CBD products manufactured and distributed by Grove Inc. must also meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the Federal Food and Drug Administration’s (the “FDA”) regulations implementing the FDCA.  While neither the FDCA nor FDA has specific provisions that related to the marketing of hemp products, the products are subject to the general adulteration and labeling provisions of the FDCA and FDA’s regulations depending on whether the product is marketed as a cosmetic, dietary supplement of food.  The permissibility of hemp products containing cannabinoids remains in a state of flux. The FDA has issued guidance titled “FDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products, Including Cannabidiol (CBD)” pursuant to which the FDA has taken the position that cannabidiol (“CBD”) is prohibited from use as an ingredient in a food or beverage or as a dietary ingredient in or as a dietary supplement based on several provisions of the FDCA. In the definition of “dietary supplement” found in the FDCA at 201 201(ff), an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, is excluded from the definition of dietary supplement. A similar provision in the FDCA at 301(ll) makes it a prohibited act to introduce or deliver into commerce any food with a substance that was investigated as a new drug prior to being included in a food. There are no similar exclusions for the use of CBD in non-drug topical products, as long as such products otherwise comply with applicable laws. The FDA created a task force to address the further regulation of CBD and other cannabis-derived products and is currently evaluating the applicable science and pathways for regulating CBD and other cannabis-derived ingredients. Additionally, various states have enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD and other hemp products. Compliance with state-specific laws and regulations could impact our operations in those specific states.  It is important to note that FDA has not taken any specific positions regarding the regulatory status of other cannabinoids, for example CBDA, CBDG, and CBDN.  Finally, the Federal Trade Commission is the agency that is vested with ensuring that all marketing claims for hemp products are truthful and non-misleading.
 
In addition, through one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, we produce primarily business-to-business CBD related trade shows in the United States and were looking to expand prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trade shows have been profitable and allow Grove to market its own CBD products while also increasing the awareness of the expanding CBD market to the public.
 
The following is the ownership structure chart of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries as of June 30, 2021: 
 

Grove is committed to providing high quality hemp products at competitive prices in retail, white label, private label and custom formulation programs. Our white label manufacturing is the partner of choice for many of the industries brands and the list of brands and products we service continues to expand. We have also set out to develop a world-class portfolio of our own proprietary brands that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value.

We operate manufacturing and distribution centers in Las Vegas, Nevada and Denver, Colorado and expect to expand into the eastern US with a new sale and distribution center in Florida scheduled to be opened in late 2021. While we currently do not export our products directly to Europe, in the prior 12 months, we sold flavoring products (which do not include hemp or CBD) to one end user customer that in turn distributed such product to several European countries in which it operates. We have no immediate plans to export or distribute any products to Europe.
 
Our Products
 
Grove, Inc. is focused on the manufacturing of CBD products through custom manufacturing, wholesale distribution and retail sales. Our primary products are Gummies, Tinctures, Topical Cosmetics and Flower, with a variety of formulas of cannabinoids and other additives. Our products use Full-spectrum CBD, Broad-spectrum and CBD isolate. 
 
The industrial hemp market is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 34% from USD 4.6 billion in 2019 to USD 26.6 billion by 2025. The growth of this market is attributed to the increased consumption of hemp-based products. However, the complex regulatory structure for the usage of industrial hemp in different countries is expected to hinder the market growth of industrial hemp.
 
The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based consumables, cosmetics, bio plastics and textiles, to list a few. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that today includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies that use our manufacturing capabilities to produce their internally developed consumer products for distribution. In addition, many of our customers use our propriety products and sell them under their own labels.
 
There are approximately 60 outlets in mainstream commercial and retail stores that currently stock and sell our products, with the most significant concentration in Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas. However, we believe that as awareness continues to grow for hemp-based products, such as CBD and other products derived from hemp, the market has and will continue to grow over the next several years. 
 
Our target customers are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales, direct-to-consumer retail stores, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting developers of products that we can easily produce with our manufacturing capabilities, national and regional broker networks and major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We attribute our success to the following Growth in CBD Manufacturing.
 
Growing Participant in CBD Product Manufacturing. We are a growing North American distributor and manufacturer of premium CBD products for many of the largest CBD distributors and brands. We manufacture most of our products in our Henderson Nevada leased facility. We believe that loyalty to our brands continues to strengthen as we continue to expand our capabilities and product offering to existing and new customers.
 
Market Knowledge and Understanding. Due to our experience and our research and development of quality CBD products as well as expansion into new and varied formulations and product categories, we believe our long-term industry relationships will continue to expand. We continue to have a keen understanding of customer needs and desires in both our B2B and B2C customer categories. Custom formulations and a continued commitment to new and improved products at the best possible price has created strong customer demand and a robust pipeline.
 
Comprehensive Product Offering. We believe we offer a comprehensive portfolio of CBD products and maintain over 1,000 SKUs (stock keeping units) for our customers to choose from. This broad product offering creates a “one-stop” shop for our customers and positively distinguishes us from our competitors. In addition, we are cultivating a portfolio of well-known brands and premium products.
Trade Show Market. Our market position in the CBD industry trade show continues to drive sales and market exposure. Although COVID-19 led to cancelation of our November 2020 show, we believe that the latest breakthroughs with the vaccine and additional precautionary measures will enable us to conduct our next show in the late 2021 expected to take pace in Las Vegas. The brand loyalty and the exposure our show customers receive with premium booth placements has driven a large demand and we anticipate continuing the growth of the tradeshow business in fiscal year 2022.
Professionalism and Entrepreneurial Culture. Our professionalism and entrepreneurial culture foster highly dedicated employees who provide our customers with unsurpassed customer service. We continue to invest in our talent by providing every sales representative with an extensive and ongoing education and have successfully developed programs that provide comprehensive product knowledge and the tools needed to have a unique understanding of our customers’ personalities and decision-making processes.
 
Relationships and Superior Service first. We aim to be the premier partner for our customers and suppliers.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our growth will continue to be focused on the vertical integration and growth of all segments of the CBD space:
 
CBD Product Research and Development. Our team provides custom products and proprietary formulations for some of the most popular industry items. We also continue to expand product offerings with the development and launch of new items on a regular basis. Custom formulations for outside brands build long term commitments from our customers.
 
Direct-to-Consumer Expansion. Our direct-to-consumer business is expected to be our growth driver for the next several years. The lower cost of our in-house research, development and manufacturing give us a measurable cost and production advantage, which we believe to be the key to our future success, as margins in the industry compress and are expected to continue to compress over the next several years.
 
CBD.io Market Place and Trade Show. Our launch of the CBD.io market platform in 2021 is expected to be a driver for growth into 2022 and a driver of retention for the brands that manufacture for us and list acceptable products on the platform. This high margin business should be a driver for future growth in all segments of the business.
Dependable White/Private Label Manufacturing Service. Our experience and dedicated team continue to refine and expand our white label program and has become a manufacturer to many regional and nationwide brands. Our operations in this segment have doubled over 2020, which we attribute to our commitment to high quality and on time manufacturing.
 
Our market position in the CBD industry trade show continues to drive sales and market exposure. Although COVID-19 led to cancelation of our November 2020 show, we believe that the latest breakthroughs with the vaccine and additional safety measures will enable us to conduct our next show in late 2021 expected to take place in Las Vegas. The brand loyalty and the exposure our show customers receive with premium booth placements has driven a large demand and we anticipate expansion of shows and venues in fiscal year 2022.
 
Core Brand Distribution. The nationwide rollout of our in-house brands will be another substantial driver of growth for the foreseeable future, we began expansion of our sales and marketing teams into the beginning of 2021 and will look to add talented people in all areas of the business to push current and future growth opportunities.
 
Acquisition Strategy. We have completed two acquisitions through June 30, 2021 with the consolidation and synergies expected to be completed October 2021. In addition, we have acquired VitaMedica Corporation on August 1, 2021 and expect distribution and administrative functions to be completed prior to December 31, 2021. We will continue to search for target acquisitions that meet our acquisition criteria and are accretive to our business. Our platform was built from the ground up to promote acquisitions expansion as a driver of substantial growth as the industry matures and margins compress. Our relationships and partners in the trade show and manufacturing business will be a key source for possible candidates. Our criteria will be stringent, and we will look at any and all opportunities that allow us to use our low-cost manufacturing to drive higher margins in acquisition candidates. Small regional brands with distribution would benefit greatly in both low-cost manufacturing and quality research and development of new and current product offerings available from our inhouse brands and products. As margins compress in the industry, the low-cost manufacturing capabilities will be a key component to higher profits leading to consolidation which we intend to capitalize on in the coming years.

Competition
 
There is vigorous competition within each market where our CBD products are sold. Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability, and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and the pace and timing of new product introductions also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions. We compete against several national and international companies, most of which have substantially greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of CBD products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. They include, among others, 3CHI, Spring Creek Labs, Kazmira LLC, Global Cannabinoids, Triangle Trading Company, Harbor City Hemp and many others. We also face competition from several independent brands, as well as some retailers that have developed their own CBD brands. Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours. While we expect we will seek to address the aspirations of our customers at attainable price points which we believe may give us a competitive advantage, there are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete within this sector.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas. These laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas, including, but not limited to, the hemp business in the United States, the consumer products and nutritional supplement markets in the United States, consumer protection, labor, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, federal and state healthcare, environmental and safety. The successful execution of our business objectives will be contingent upon our compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, permits and registrations, which may be onerous and expensive. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in such applicable laws and regulations and the expansion of the Company’s business, could make our products less attractive to our customers, delay the introduction of new products, and require the Company to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
We operate our business in markets that are both highly regulated and rapidly evolving. We are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations affecting the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and sale of food, beverages, dietary supplements, and personal care products/cosmetics, as well as the use of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients like CBD in such products. The FDA regulates hemp and hemp-derived ingredients in FDA-regulated products pursuant to the provisions of the FDCA and regulations promulgated pursuant to it, in particular those related to adulteration and labeling of cosmetic, food, and dietary supplements. The FDA has issued guidance on the subject and issued letters to companies regarding claims made for products and the use of such ingredients in various products. The FDA also initiated a task force to evaluate pathways for further regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients. At various times, bills pertaining to the regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients have been introduced in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and additional proposed legislation is expected to be introduced in the future to clarify the regulatory status of cannabinoids from hemp generally and CBD generally. Future legislation approved by Congress and signed by the President, or rulemaking promulgated by the FDA, could either positively or adversely impact the future sale of products by the Company.
 
We are currently not subject to any foreign regulations as we do not currently distribute or export any products, including hemp or CBD related products outside the U.S. Additionally, we are not aware of any foreign regulations that we had to comply with in regard to the sale of our flavoring products to one end user customer in the U.S. who distributed such products to Europe where it had operations. The responsibility for compliance with any European regulations would be on such customer. 
 
Additionally, numerous states have passed forms of hemp legislation governing the cultivation of hemp, as well as the further processing and sale of hemp and products with hemp or hemp-derived ingredients. Those states that have not yet enacted laws or issued regulations pertaining to hemp and hemp-derived ingredients may do so in the near future. Unless Congress specifically enacts laws preempting the state regulations of hemp products we will continue to be subject not only to federal law but various state laws. Presently, Grove and only distributes hemp-products in states that it is legal to do so. Changes in the state laws and regulations could again either positively or adversely affect our ability to sell products in those states.
 
Employees
 
The Company has 122 full-time employees working out of its headquarters in Henderson, Las Vegas, its Denver Colorado manufacturing facility, Los Angeles California or individuals’ home-based offices.
