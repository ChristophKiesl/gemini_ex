Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW
We partner with Nature to design, develop and commercialize microbes, molecules, and materials for diverse end markets. Our goal is to create new products with our proprietary platform that unlocks the design and manufacturing efficiency of biological processes with technology’s ability to rapidly iterate and control diverse functions. We believe our process will create better products, a better way, for a better world.
Our platform revolves around three key capabilities: our collection of accessible biomolecules, our software and data science technology and our data driven microbe optimization processes. We have one of the world’s largest collections of accessible biomolecules. This physical and DNA sequence database has within it the potential to create hundreds of thousands of small molecules, millions of natural products and hundreds of millions of proteins. This provides novel starting points for the creation of interesting molecules, materials, enzymes, and potential therapeutics. Our software and data science platform informs, guides, and records our experiments forming the infrastructure for the virtuous learning cycle that continually enriches our processes. Once a promising biomolecule is selected, using our strain engineering capabilities we can work across organisms and employ numerous strategies to optimize performance, cost, and scalability to meet an unmet market need. Throughout our work, we power and scale the science with high-throughput automation. 
Using our platform we are building three businesses focused on multiple markets:
1.Advanced Materials. Our advanced materials business seeks to employ bio-advantaged molecules or microbes to develop and deliver high performance products and is currently focused on four markets: agriculture, water repellency, advanced polymers, and healthcare. In agriculture, our most advanced product aims to improve crop nutrient uptake for significant markets, including corn, wheat, and sorghum. In the water repellency program, we are developing a family of molecules that improve the water repellency characteristics of cellulosic substrates. Our advanced polymers products include our ZYM0101 electronics film, which is being developed in partnership with Sumitomo, and use of our ZYM0102 polymer (the basis for Hyaline, which we have discontinued) for 3D printing applications. Finally, in healthcare materials, our first products are two enzymes that are critical to produce mRNA vaccines, namely 2’-O’-Methyltransferase (“2’-O-MT”) and Vaccinia Capping Enzyme (“VCE”). 
2.Drug Discovery. Our drug discovery business leverages our differentiated access to natural products as a source of diverse chemical matter provided by our unified metagenomics database (“UMDB”).
3.Automation. Our automation business offers proven automation technology to organizations interested in improving the throughput, efficiency, and reliability of their lab operations.
Our products are in various stages of development ranging from concept to pilot stage. We have not yet generated revenue from product sales (except for nominal revenue related to the sale of samples) and we continue to expect product revenue to be immaterial in 2022. However, most of these programs leverage data and learnings from our earlier work, which we believe enables our teams to move more quickly and precisely with each new program, and ultimately helps power our platform and make it more robust over time. For example, as part of our review of our product pipeline we researched market adjacencies for molecules we have already developed, including molecules that were the basis for Hyaline. Stemming from those efforts, we identified opportunities for using ZYM0102 polymer in high-performance 3D printing applications.
With our platform and building blocks derived from Nature, we believe we can design, develop, and manufacture high-performance products more cleanly and with less waste than traditional chemicals and materials companies. Our goal is to utilize our proprietary platform to make products that will not clog our waterways or pollute our oceans. Consumers, regulators and customers are all demanding solutions to these problems. We believe that by partnering with Nature we can make better products, a better way, for a better world.

Restructure
Since our business update on August 3, 2021, we have made significant progress on our previously announced assessment of our target markets and the fit of the products in our pipeline to those markets (the “Portfolio Review”), and the development of our new strategic plan. We have reorganized the company with a focus on creating a more efficient organization by eliminating leadership layers and consolidating distributed functions. As part of those efforts, we eliminated approximately 220 positions. We also established new operating systems and processes across the company, including more rigorous annual strategic planning and product development processes. Additionally, we reviewed our potential market opportunities and the related project portfolio, using a standardized evaluation process applied to current and potential market segments. This included a review of market size, addressable market, competitive profiles, product development cost, cost of goods of the final offering, cost of customer acquisition, time to market, margin profile, and development risk. As a result of our Portfolio Review, we determined to focus on a smaller number of programs that we believe capitalize on our capabilities and provide commercial opportunities. To that end, we discontinued our electronics film programs, other than ZYM0101, which is being developed in partnership with Sumitomo Chemical, because emerging data on the market segment we were targeting with Hyaline and other electronics films indicated a smaller near-term opportunity than previously expected. We also discontinued our consumer care programs, including our insect repellent, ZYM0201, because we determined through our Portfolio Review that the costs of customer acquisition with a direct-to-consumer model would have been prohibitive and, in the case of ZYM0201, it could not be produced and distributed at a price point competitive with incumbent products. 
With our focus on a smaller number of programs and reduced cost structure, and with the benefit of the analyses and evaluations that we conducted through the Portfolio Review, we developed a 3-year strategic plan which details clear milestones and goals. Our plan has a multiple component framework. Our investments will prioritize near-term revenue and build a pipeline of new opportunities by investing in research. We believe this will fuel the creation of distinctive high-performing products. We have refocused our research team to work on rapid cycles of innovation and are now working across multiple categories of opportunities.
We also restructured some of our expenses, including lease expenses. We recorded restructuring costs of $28.8 million in 2021, including $8.7 million in severance and employee-related restructuring costs and an impairment charge of $11.8 million with respect to certain manufacturing equipment. The restructuring activities were substantially complete as of December 31, 2021. We expect to incur additional restructuring costs which are currently estimable of approximately $0.5 million in 2022. However, certain activities, such as lease restructuring, will extend into the first half of 2022. With this downsizing and restructuring we believe that we will have sufficient operating capital to continue to fund our operations to the middle of 2023. 
PRODUCTS & PIPELINE
We believe the market opportunity addressable by our platform is enormous and diverse. In addition to the industries and applications we are currently targeting in our three businesses, our research team is working across many categories of additional potential opportunities. 
Advanced Materials
The chemicals and materials sectors are large and diverse and play an essential part in producing most of the material goods we interact with on a daily basis. We believe that Zymergen is well suited to create and deliver distinctive, high-performing products into this space that are better for our customers, better for our world, and better for the people who make them. 
Our goal with Advanced Materials is to employ bio-advantaged molecules or microbes to develop and deliver high performance products. In some cases, the end product delivered to a customer may be an engineered microorganism, not a molecule or material. We utilize our three-step platform—Design Product, Create Microbe, and Scale Production, described in more detail in “—Our Platform”—to translate market needs into materials. We plan to prioritize molecules from our known molecular families that are relatively inaccessible through petrochemistry, but we may launch products with non-fermented production means to accelerate time to market, provided there is an ultimate biological source. Our focus on time to market will dictate that we first look for extensions of existing products and/or applications of existing assets, opening new market segments cautiously. We seek to develop products that offer both improved performance and value versus incumbents, while viewing sustainability as a mechanism to convert markets quickly. We recognize that, short of regulatory requirements, existing markets will likely convert slowly to sustainable products if the cost and performance do not offer advantages. 
The Advanced Materials business is initially focused on developing microbes, molecules and materials for four key markets: Agriculture, Water Repellency, Advanced Polymers, and Healthcare.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

A.Agriculture
Agriculture is 4% of global GDP and faces a range of urgent challenges, according to the World Bank. Current projections estimate that by 2050 there will be approximately 10 billion people on the planet, according to an Elementa study. There will be more mouths to feed, and richer and more varied diets will become more widespread as countries become more prosperous. Crop production needs are expected to more than double by 2050 to feed the global population, according to an Elementa study. The environmental impact of the agriculture industry is also profound with agriculture being one of the largest contributors to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. This is driven in part by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through the nitrogen fertilizer production process, nitrous oxide from fertilized fields, and deforestation to create room for crops or livestock. The pollution generated by runoff from fertilizers and manure is also devastating to fragile natural ecosystems.
Nitrogen fixation partnership: ZYM0301
Our most advanced agricultural product is focused on improving crop nutrient uptake for significant markets, including corn, wheat, and sorghum. We have partnered with a company that is catalyzing the shift from the traditional Haber-Bosch process of nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing to microbial nitrogen fixation. We believe that microbes can meet all of corn’s nitrogen needs, reducing or eliminating dependence on synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), around 50% of crops globally are reliant on synthetic nitrogen today. Roughly 1% of the world’s energy consumption is used to produce nitrogen fertilizer, and this comes with serious environmental impacts, ranging from dead zones at sea to decomposition into nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that is nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide and responsible for approximately 5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. 
The program’s goal is to design a consortium of microbial strains that improve a crop’s access to nitrogen by colonizing the plant's root system and producing sufficient plant-available nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) to meet a sizable portion of the plant’s overall nitrogen needs. We are finalizing our second-generation consortia, which we expect to go into field testing in 2022, and commencing work on our third-generation consortia. We believe the increased amount of nitrogen accessible to the plant has the potential to improve environmental outcomes and lead to more favorable economics across the value chain.
Microbial strains capture nitrogen from the atmosphere while optimizing ammonia capture across crop roots at various depths.
Our partnership program is focused on cereal crops and nitrogen fixation, and we believe that the same predictive assays that have enabled our efficient strain engineering during our partnership program can be applied to future opportunities. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

B.Water Repellency
Our water repellency program focuses on a family of molecules that adhere to cellulose and functionalize the coated substrate to repel water. Coated paper that repels water has numerous potential applications in food and beverage packaging and other related markets. 
Zymergen is creating a family of molecules that adhere to cellulose and repel water.
The first water repellency product we are targeting is paper straws. The world consumes billions of single-use plastic drinking straws each year. Plastic straws are neither biodegradable nor recyclable, and often end up in landfills and waterways. Consumer demand for a high performing, eco-friendly straw is high, as is demonstrated by the rise in metal, glass, paper, bamboo, and other types of more eco-friendly straws. In line with customer demand, the regulatory environment has become more restrictive, with dozens of countries imposing restrictions or bans on single-use plastic packaging. Correspondingly, there has been a rise in “eco-friendly” packaging products. Problematically, currently marketed paper straws often lack in performance: they soften in liquids, quickly losing their structural integrity, resulting in an overall unpleasant user experience. Additionally, many paper straws currently on the market are not recyclable. When our coating is applied to paper and rolled into a straw, the result is a straw that is both water resistant and, based on the chemical composition of the coated paper, we believe will be recyclable. 
We believe our water repellency technology is extensible to other substrates, which may broaden the application to markets such as clothing. 
C.Advanced Polymers
The markets being targeted for our advanced polymers are large and diverse and demand ever improving high-performance materials to enable rapid product evolution at a competitive cost. Our products have potential to be used in a broad variety of applications. Our advanced polymers products include our ZYM0101 electronics film, which is being developed in partnership with Sumitomo, and our ZYM0102 polymer (which was the basis for Hyaline, which we have discontinued) for 3D printing applications.
Flexible optical film with high modulus: ZYM0101
ZYM0101 is a colorless polyimide film made using a bio-based monomer produced using fermentation. The product is being developed under our partnership with Sumitomo Chemical for potential applications including cover windows for foldable phones, tablets, and laptops. The distinctive features of ZYM0101 are high modulus, high hardness, high elongation-at-break, and strong optical properties in terms of transparency and haze. We have demonstrated that ZYM0101 offers a higher modulus than competing colorless polyimide films and more flexibility than ultra-thin glass. We believe ZYM0101 is particularly well suited for the following applications:
•Display cover window applications in foldable smartphones, tablets, and notebooks
•Rollable displays (e.g., rollable TVs or rollable tablets)
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Consistent with similar products in this industry, we expect ZYM0101 to undergo a qualification process with all customers that typically takes 6-18 months. 
3D printing polymer: ZYM0102
3D printing enables manufacturers to make specially designed parts by printing layers of a material, such as polymer, that are fused together to create a single object designed using a computer-generated model. 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize supply chains—reducing waste, creating efficiencies, allowing flexibility, and producing parts that are lighter-weight, more reliable, and custom-made. Imagine, for example, if a military team deployed to a remote location could use 3D printing to replace a part in a broken vehicle, instead of waiting weeks or months for that same part to ship from a traditional parts manufacturer.
We anticipate making our ZYM0102 polymer available in both powder and pellets, which we are seeking to sell to original equipment manufacturers who could use it to 3D print parts for application in military/defense, aerospace, and automotive industries. We believe our ZYM0102 polymer, which was the basis for Hyaline, has advantages for printing parts that require higher tensile strength and improved yield, showing higher strength compared to incumbents. Its lower glass transition temperature, which is the softening temperature, opens the possibility to print at lower temperatures and therefore, with lower cost printers. 
We believe ZYM0102 has the potential for broad applicability across a wide range of market segments. We are currently pursuing applications in parts and tooling for military/defense, aerospace, and high-end automotive markets. 
D.Healthcare - Enzymes
In the healthcare market, we are developing a portfolio of enzymes for use in vaccine production. Our first two enzyme products are 2’-O-MT and VCE, both of which are key enzymes used in the production of mRNA vaccines. 
The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the scientific community to deliver novel vaccines based on mRNA technology, generating a global market for enzymatic capping in 2022 estimated at approximately $800 million. As supply catches up with demand, the focus is now shifting to high-quality materials that support post-COVID regulatory requirements for mRNA manufacturing. Accelerated investment in mRNA technology concurrently opened doors to many potential new and adjacent therapeutic options (e.g., cell and gene therapies). Currently, there are over 200 mRNA vaccines and therapeutics in pre-clinical and clinical development. 
We believe we can provide high-quality, reliable, cost-leading enzyme supply. For example, although we began our VCE program just over a year ago, we have already achieved significant progress, all enabled by our platform, which provided the infrastructure to move quickly and allowed us to take creative approaches to solving big challenges in enzyme production. In our phase 1 mRNA program we established baseline processes. Using a combination of strain and process engineering, we then improved expression by up to 20 times. With these improvements our enzyme soluble protein measurements exceed known industry benchmarks, and we believe we are on track to achieve further improvement before scale-up. 
This initial work provides key enzyme products and also builds the infrastructure to launch future programs for additional and/or improved enzymes more quickly and efficiently. We believe this is just the start of a significant opportunity to support ongoing development of post-COVID mRNA therapeutics and vaccines with the potential to treat a wide range of other diseases. We believe we can help not just with the near term raw material requirements but also with the future demand for reagents for frontier therapeutics. 
E.Research
We plan to invest aggressively in research to fuel a growing pipeline of what we call “seeds,” which are early-stage ideas that demonstrate promise to grow into products. We plan to divide this investment between evolutionary opportunities (for example, follow-on versions of existing products or natural extensions of existing capabilities) and revolutionary ones that we believe could evolve into blockbuster products. We expect to focus these research efforts on advanced materials, with some capacity assigned to exploring enzymes and microbes-as-a-product.
Drug Discovery
Natural products are the basis for some of the most important drugs on the market including immunomodulators (e.g., rapamycin), cardiovascular medicines (e.g., statins), many chemotherapeutics (e.g., paclitaxel, Kyprolis) and the majority of antibiotics. While traditional approaches to natural product drug discovery are no longer considered effective, advances in metagenomics, machine learning, and synthetic biology have the potential to transform how natural products are discovered and developed. Our drug discovery platform combines three core competencies—metagenomics, machine learning, and synthetic biology.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Unified Metagenomics Database (UMDB)
Our UMDB is one of the largest metagenomics databases of its kind, and it has continued to grow, providing us access to millions of novel bioactives from uncultured bacteria and fungi. 
Machine Learning (ML)
Our proprietary ML tools, including data science and cheminformatics, allow us to efficiently search our databases and enrich for the most promising candidates for activity against human targets. From millions of biosynthetic gene clusters in our UMDB, we can downselect to dozens of candidates with the highest potential to encode molecules with activity against the target of interest. Our target-focused in silico downselect and follow-on analyses can be completed in a few weeks, which has the potential to transform early drug discovery into a rapid and accurate database search.
Synthetic Biology
Our proprietary synthetic biology platform enables us to make complex molecules that are challenging or sometimes impossible to make with synthetic chemistry. We can engineer microbes to make a wide range of complex compounds across a wide range of biological hosts, providing potential to produce physical material for activity validation, derivatization, and other aspects of preclinical development. 
Our Approach
Many important drug targets are challenging to address with today’s leading therapeutic modalities. Traditional synthetic small molecules are insufficient for many targets, and monoclonal antibodies are too large to pass through cellular membranes. Natural products can offer a potential solution for challenging intracellular targets. They are larger than traditional synthetic small molecules, but can have good cell penetrance and bioavailability. They are structurally diverse, are enriched for bioactivity, and exhibit novel binding mechanisms relative to other sources of chemical diversity. Natural products could potentially form the basis of traditional modulators, targeted protein degraders (PROTACS), or other conjugates such as antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”). The majority of ADCs approved to date leverage natural product warheads. 
Natural Products are encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (known as “clusters” or “BGCs”) in the genomes of bacteria and fungi as well as plants. These clusters of genes work as a factory to produce natural product molecules that have been selected over millions of years of evolution to efficiently modulate a target protein. Our UMDB is one of the largest and highest quality of its kind, containing terabases of proprietary metagenomics data from uncultured microbes. 
This snapshot shows ~1 million natural product gene clusters from our fully sequenced UMDB that we have projected onto a 3D space. Each point is an individual cluster, with distances between points reflecting similarity among the clusters - and by extension among the natural products they encode. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

We search our UMDB using a variety of data science methods to associate clusters with targets of interest. Whereas natural product drug discovery campaigns previously started with tedious physical library screening our process begins with a rapid and accurate digital database search. Once we have prioritized clusters for a target of interest, we then use our synthetic biology platform to express the natural product(s) encoded by the cluster and subsequently work to empirically validate our computational predictions. 
Once a molecule with confirmed activity is identified, we can use a variety of tools to create analogs with potentially improved properties to advance the program towards drug-like performance. In addition to total synthesis of discovered molecules, we can use semi-synthetic approaches as well as “natural analoging,” further leveraging our UMDB to access complex analogs with core scaffold changes. This combination of analoging approaches, as well as other approaches enabled by synthetic biology, can de-risk lead optimization of natural products compared to historical industry practices. In addition, we have proprietary cheminformatics tools that can aid the design of advanced analogs with superior properties. 
Critical to the power of this process is the ability to rapidly and accurately identify novel clusters relevant to a specific human target. We have patented one method to do this by exploiting the concept of “resistance genes.” Clusters encode molecules that are designed to inhibit a target protein in a competitor species. One strategy that microbes use to protect themselves from the metabolite they produce is to encode an extra copy of the target protein with mutations that make it resistant to the chemical element it produces. Examining this resistance gene can reveal the protein target of the inhibitor encoded by the cluster prior to structural or biochemical elucidation. By accessing a very large number of clusters in our metagenomic libraries, we have sufficient scale to find the cases where a resistance gene is encoded, revealing the target of the molecule.
Using this methodology, we have been able to confirm multiple currently marketed blockbuster drugs and molecules in late clinical development and discover novel modulators of important oncology targets. For example, we searched our UMDB for clusters that we predicted to encode molecules active against PSMB5, an essential subunit of the proteasome. This is the target of multiple drugs such as Velcade, Kyprolis and Ninlaro. We identified multiple clusters:
•Certain clusters we identified related to the known natural product salinosporamide family. Salinosporamide A was previously progressed to phase III clinical trials as Marizomib. Identification of these clusters demonstrates our ability to accurately discover BGCs with clinical potential.
•Other clusters we identified related to the Epoxomicin gene cluster that is the progenitor of the commercialized drug Kyprolis. This further demonstrates our ability to rapidly identify high quality chemical matter as well as showing that we can identify diverse scaffolds in a single search.
•We identified other clusters that we predict encode molecules active against PSMB5. The identification of these clusters demonstrates the utility of our platform for de novo discovery.
We searched for clusters that we predicted to encode molecules active against PSMB5, an essential subunit of the proteasome. This is the target of multiple drugs such as Velcade, Kyprolis and Ninlaro. At the top right, we identified clusters, all of which were related to a known natural product, salinosporamide. In the middle right, we identified a set of clusters related to the Epoxomicin gene cluster that is the progenitor of the commercialized drug Kyprolis. On the bottom right we highlight one of several novel clusters that we predict encode molecules active against PSMB5. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

In another example, we searched our UMDB for novel inhibitors of MetAP1, a target that has been linked to lung and bone cancers. Of the millions of clusters in our UMDB, our informatics search predicted 20 clusters to encode novel, structurally distinct inhibitors. To date, we have tested two of these predictions in in vitro assays and confirmed their bioactivity against the human protein in both cases. The first active molecule is a novel peptide macrocycle we have named Metapeptin. We have validated that Metapeptin is selective for MetAP1 over MetAP2. The second cluster that we tested is also active and is structurally distinct. Subsequently, we used our proprietary design tools to create analogs predicted to have improved properties, demonstrating our ability to discover and develop novel leads for human therapeutic targets.
Our UMDB contains structurally novel inhibitors for human targets of interest.
Based on our in silico analyses of industry prioritized cancer targets, we believe that our approach for identifying novel natural products may be applicable to a broad set of oncology targets.
Our position in the drug discovery space was strengthened by our acquisition of Lodo Therapeutics in mid-2021. Lodo Therapeutics brings additional expertise in metagenomics as well as an experienced drug discovery team and proprietary technology, including experience with “natural analoging” (as discussed above) and proprietary natural products cheminformatics and structure-based drug design capabilities. Lodo continues to progress its existing multi-target discovery collaboration with Genentech (part of the Roche Group) by building on its earlier achievements of preclinical milestones.
Our initial drug discovery pipeline is focused on industry-recognized oncology targets where precision medicine and our distinctive, complex molecules are expected to provide competitive and therapeutic advantages. We initially plan to advance our drug discovery business via collaborations with leading industry partners. 
Automation
Early in its history, Zymergen recognized a technology gap: despite increasing demand by the scientific community for lab automation, investment in new automation technologies was not keeping pace, and the solutions available were insufficient to meet demands for progress, growth, and efficiency. Unsatisfied with existing off-the-shelf solutions, we created a patented full-stack automation system that meets the needs of dynamic lab operations with integrated hardware (our RAC system) and custom software (our ACS), improving performance and reducing some workloads from months to days.
Now, we are offering our advanced automation technology to organizations interested in improving the throughput, efficiency, and reliability of their lab operations. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Reconfigurable Automation Cart (RACs)
The Reconfigurable Automation Cart (“RAC”) is the hardware building block of our system. It uses standardized connections and an integrated conveyor, enabling creation and modification of workcells of all sizes in hours or days, rather than months. RACs contain laboratory devices such as liquid handlers, thermal cyclers, and plate readers that perform the work at each station in the work cell. We currently support 20 device types and have designed the system to enable adding new ones easily. We think of each RAC as a building block for lab automation, where connecting any two blocks is easy and the blocks themselves can take different shapes for different applications. This reconfigurability can enable scientists and automation engineers to collaborate on new process development with lower capital expenditures and shorter development lead times.
The workcell shown here was assembled in a single day and is reconfigured many times per year with very little down-time, adding or subtracting RACs for load balancing or for new capabilities. 
Automation Control Software (ACS)
Automation Control Software (“ACS”) is our custom, cloud-based software used to control integrated automation systems—both RACs and traditional (non-RAC) workcells. ACS is built with a microservices architecture on a modern web stack. ACS can dynamically schedule workflows, collect scientific and process data (instrument performance, utilization, plate data, etc.), and monitor progress, improving schedules as work is dispatched. 
We are offering to third party customers our RAC system and ACS, coupled with a combination of one-time services (e.g., installation, training, customization, application engineering) and recurring services (e.g., basic maintenance and support, comprehensive managed system support). We intend to market our technology both to customers who desire scalable, high-throughput, high-uptime turnkey solutions for established workflows, as well as to those who are interested in customizing our flexible systems to their unique needs. Initially, we will offer the protocols that were developed for in-house use, adding additional protocols based on market demand. Over time, we plan to build an extensive library of solutions in service of different life science industry segments. These standardized, validated turn-key workflow solutions could then be sold to customers without the need for additional R&D investment.
We are also developing a solution called AutoPal for centrally managing liquid handler protocols and associated parameters. We plan to start offering this solution to customers in 2023.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR STRATEGY
Substantially all of our revenue to date has been generated from R&D service contracts and collaboration arrangements aimed at developing, testing and validating our platform by providing custom services for use only by the collaboration partner. Over the next few years, we are seeking to develop and commercialize our products and generate revenue from these products. Our long-term objective is to generate revenue from the sale of numerous breakthrough products across a variety of industries. For the next several years, we plan to pursue opportunities where partners can carry the burden of commercial marketing and distribution of the final product, allowing us to focus on creation and delivery of compelling products to those partners. In addition, although we currently outsource our manufacturing to third-party vendors, over time, we plan to increase manufacturing value capture and accelerate time to market by vertically integrating pilot scale fermentation.
Our long-term objective is to generate revenue from the sale of numerous products across a variety of industries. In particular, launching fermentation-produced products or products with fermentation-produced components or ingredients is a key element of our strategy for lowering manufacturing costs and launching products desirable to our customers. In some cases, we may initially launch products using molecules we have identified during the design phase of our process but which are first produced with non-fermentation based methods. We refer to this strategy as Launch Acceleration and expect to utilize it where we believe it will allow us to achieve commercial launch more quickly and where we believe there is an ultimate biological source and a clear path to transition to the biological source. Launch Acceleration often results in a higher cost of production than can be achieved with fermentation-based production. We expect to temporarily absorb this cost if we believe it is outweighed by the benefit of faster product launch. We may also source molecules from biological sources other than fermentation where we identify a molecule available in nature that we believe has attractive properties and that is available from a non-fermentation based source such as plant derived molecules. In some cases we may develop a fermentation based process for production of those biomolecules where we believe it makes commercial sense to do so, and in other cases we may source such biomolecules from their biological sources. 
PLATFORM
Our platform is a unique, end-to-end fusion of biology, chemistry and technology built on a stack that integrates techniques in molecular biology, chemistry, materials science, lab automation systems, software applications, unique databases, and machine learning algorithms. We have demonstrated the ability to complete each step in the entire product, microbe, and process development effort multiple times. We have innovations and intellectual property across this stack—for example, techniques for editing the genomes of industrial microbes or multiple proprietary data sets. The real power, however, comes from the fusion of these innovations into an integrated whole.
Our platform fuses biology, chemistry, and technology and grows smarter over time
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Using the platform, our product developers generally follow a three-step process designed to translate market needs into materials. The three steps are:
1.Design Product: Develop a material that can deliver the necessary performance at an acceptable cost.
2.Create Microbe: Create or engineer a microbe to make the desired biomolecule and pick the optimal microbe for the lifecycle of the material.
3.Scale Production: Develop an end-to-end production process, including microbe optimization, fermentation, downstream process, and finally scale up.
Although these are described as “steps,” our platform is inherently flexible, allowing each step to be completed sequentially, in parallel, or independently. In some cases, the design, development, and commercialization of a product may only leverage certain of the steps, or even just certain of the features within the platform’s suite of offerings. Generally, our Advanced Materials business deploys all three steps, while our Automation and Drug Discovery businesses take unique approaches, as described in those respective sections above. However, even within Advanced Materials, certain products may be better suited for some steps within the platform and not others. For example, with our healthcare materials pipeline, the products sought (2’-O-MT and VCE) were already known, which allowed us to start with step 2 (Create Microbe). 
Building our platform required us to solve hard problems at each step. Biology is powerful but often unfathomably complex. Classical scientific approaches to bio-based product design, microbe creation, and scaling production have been slow, expensive, unpredictable, and prone to failure. By integrating software and data science with cutting-edge biology tools, we believe that we have addressed many of the technical problems that kept many earlier synthetic biology companies from commercial success. Crucially, our workflow has improved over time as successive rounds of biomolecule design, microbe creation, and product optimization have generated more proprietary data, further enhancing our algorithms.
Step 1: Design Product
Our platform has the potential to create new and better products because we start with the molecular diversity of biology. Living cells are the most sophisticated chemical factories known. They continuously produce and interconvert tens of thousands of molecules through the thousands of reactions catalyzed by the enzymes encoded in their genomes. Today there are approximately 150,000 metabolic reactions cataloged and approximately 200,000,000 known proteins capable of catalyzing these reactions. The total number of potential organic small molecules is estimated at 1060. Importantly, many of these molecules have properties that are hard or impossible to obtain from synthetic chemistry, such as chirality (the property of left- and right-handedness, common to the biochemistry of all life forms). Zymergen has systems in place to access approximately 75,000 biomolecules today with strategies in place to access many more over time.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Challenge: Discovering the best biomolecule.
But the very diversity of the molecules that living cells produce inevitably creates a challenge. How should we select the best biomolecules to solve a customer’s problem from a library of approximately 75,000? We have created a set of processes and tools designed to solve this problem.
Classical chemical building blocks (left) are considerably less rich in potential function than bio-sourced molecules (right), a small number of which are shown here. Biomolecules frequently employ heteroatoms, chirality, or reactive moieties which offer unique functional property combinations.
A.Create a large catalog of biomolecules.
Our collection of potential biomolecules consists of molecule structures that we can choose from and the enzymatic reactions (“pathway”) that allow us to produce them. The total that our chemists and material scientists use today for advanced materials is approximately 75,000, which is a subset of the full catalog we have created and that is available to our platform (more than one million biomolecules). The database is a combination of public and proprietary data, and the data unique to Zymergen is growing all the time.
Bio-molecules in active use today for advanced materials:
•We have approximately 10,000 biomolecules where we know both the structure and pathway exactly at the outset. This is a proprietary asset that we have created using our software algorithms. Relative to traditional petrochemicals, it is a huge untapped resource.
•We have approximately 65,000 additional molecules where we know the structure (from external databases) but the pathway is not complete. We can complete the pathway with additional molecular biology work if advanced to the “Create microbe” stage. Because all of these molecules exist in Nature, we believe that all of the pathways can be assembled, though the effort will vary by molecule.
•Our database also includes a large catalog of biomolecules not currently actively used today. For example, there are more than 80,000 additional molecules where we have computed the structures, but do not yet know the complete pathway and another one million complex molecules where the pathway is complete, but where we do not yet have the structure. We expect to use this expansive database to expand and improve product development in existing and new markets. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

B.Organize, display and search this massive catalog of molecules.
The molecules computed above are stored in our Bioreachables Database and accessed through a graphical user interface called ZYNC. Among other functions, ZYNC enables chemists and material scientists to use Boolean logic to search for chemical substructures and properties among the collection.
Using the substructure search interface in ZYNC to identify bioreachable molecules of interest.
C.Downselect to the most promising candidate molecules.
Zymergen selects the biomolecules that would be the best fit for a given task by using data science and machine learning to predict performance. Where appropriate, we use molecular simulations to enhance human judgment in selecting candidate biomolecules with potential to solve a customer’s problem or a market need. We experimentally validate the top candidates to determine which perform best. Over the course of a project, we may test several hundred formulations of the molecule to get the desired properties. For certain applications and properties, we have also collected data that informs machine learning models that help prioritize the biomolecules most likely to confer the desired properties. We expect that these models will become increasingly broad over time.
D.Prepare and test formulation performance using automation.
The ultimate tests are empirical. We incorporate the chosen biomolecules into the product formulation and experimentally evaluate performance. The assays performed depend on the application, and we have facilities and expertise to bring online additional American Society for Testing and Materials assays as needed. We employ automation and miniaturization when possible to increase throughput, reduce the need for material and improve assay precision and accuracy. The empirical data generated feeds back into our computational systems to improve the quality of our models and predictions in a virtuous cycle.
Collectively, our solutions are designed to effectively and efficiently address the challenge of identifying the right molecules to enable target product performance and solve customers’ problems. 
We believe that our approach to product design gives us an advantage over existing and future competitors. This advantage comes from the databases, tools, and patents we have already put in place and is reinforced as we continue to collect data on molecules and their performance.
Step 2: Create Microbe
Once we have identified a biomolecule that solves a customer’s problem or addresses a market need, we need to engineer a microbe capable of generating that biomolecule. Microbes are modular factories that can perform thousands of distinct chemical reactions, which can be reorganized and remixed to produce myriad biomolecules. That microbe must make the non-native biomolecule and do so in a way that we believe can later be scaled to meet market volume and price demands. We have done this many times: We have successfully created microbes that produce detectable amounts of more than 100 distinct biomolecules.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Challenge: Engineering a microbe fit for purpose.
Several problems have blocked previous attempts by synthetic biology companies to build microbes capable of producing biomolecules for commercial use.
•First, while databases do capture some information about some of the molecules observed in Nature, we are not aware of any comprehensive commercially available tools that show the biochemical steps that are used in Nature to produce each of them, making selecting the pathway genes challenging.
•Secondly, even if the biochemical steps can be discovered or developed, traditional bioengineering facilities are unable to prototype the complete set because of the vast number of configurations of the steps and the enzymes that biocatalyze each step.
•Finally, many companies pick a host microbe that is well understood or easy to engineer but is not well suited to industrial production because, for example, product toxicity limits productivity or the host is not robust to the inherent variability of non-GMP manufacturing conditions. This makes selecting the optimal host important for commercial viability and a challenging technical problem.
We solve these problems in the following ways:
A.Generate initial in silico pathway designs.
We generate and store biosynthesis pathways—the set of genes that, in sequence, could encode for the enzymes that create a biomolecule—for each molecule using ZYNC. ZYNC suggests options for pathways and provides a score for each pathway so we can prioritize the right designs. Where we have missing pathway genes, we search UMDB for phylogenetically diverse enzymes with homology to ones shown experimentally to catalyze the missing chemical transformation.
B.Pick the optimal pathway based on building many variants of the initial design.
We know, however, that our initial in silico designs are but one of many possible pathways and configurations of each pathway to test. The number of variants is far greater than anything that could be tested in the lab and humans have little ability to predict which variant will perform best. To address this challenge, we use our Automated Pathway Explorer (“APE”) which takes the pathway information from ZYNC, uses machine learning algorithms to search the UMDB for candidate enzymes, populates generalized pathway templates with specific enzyme variants, ranks each pathway instance and recommends a diverse set of candidate pathways to be installed into host microbes for evaluation.
C.Pick the right host for optimal product economics.
Finally, we use automation and a range of multipart and multisite gene editing tools to test the basic biochemical pathway in panels of hosts to be sure we have the optimal microbe for the lifecycle of the product. We choose the optimal host using a combination of techno-economic analysis and empirical data. Then we typically use robotic automation to build up to 1,000 variants of the biomolecule-producing microbe and identify the best starting point for subsequent improvement. We have experience in engineering for all major classes of microbes, including at least 15 gram-positive bacteria, 6 gram-negative bacteria, 4 yeasts, and 4 filamentous fungi.
D.Perform initial enzyme and pathway optimization.
Once a candidate pathway has been validated, we typically deploy our deep expertise in enzymology to alter and improve the biocatalytic performance of the enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway so that the pathway can deliver and meet the commercial targets. We may also create very large libraries of microbes with multiple simultaneous genetic edits. In these cases, we may choose to build biosensors into each edited microbe in the library so that the very best performing cells fluoresce and can be rapidly identified for further testing. This is enabled by our acquisition of EnEvolv alongside other technologies. 
Step 3: Scale Production
Initial work to engineer a microbe in the “Create Microbe” step results in an organism that manufactures the desired biomolecule. The efficiency of this microbe at this stage, however, is insufficient to commercialize a product. Success in the “Scale Production” phase means engineering the microbe and the accompanying process so that it will produce the desired biomolecule at scale with attractive margins.
Challenge: Scaling production.
Scaling production is a significant challenge. This final step is critical, and we believe the inability of early synthetic biology companies to solve this challenge is one of the reasons why they failed.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

A key challenge to optimizing the host microbe genome and scaling production is our very limited knowledge of host biology and metabolism. Even in the best studied hosts used in academia, 20% to 35% of genes lack experimentally validated functions. For many industrially important production hosts, the vast majority of genes lack experimentally validated functions. To reinforce this point, while there are hundreds of thousands of academic papers describing well-studied hosts, industrial hosts are often described by just a few thousand or even a few hundred.
While computational methods are commonly used to predict gene functions in industrial hosts, the performance is very poor with the consequence that our real understanding of the biochemistry and genetics of these hosts is very poor. Practically, this means that biological engineers are unable to reliably engineer a microbe to reliably perform at full commercial scale. Approaches based on rational design, which presume a good understanding of the biology system to be engineered, are particularly challenged. 
We believe our platform has solved these problems: we can reliably improve many traits of the microbe, including yield, titer, rate, tolerance to high concentrations of product or co-products, avoidance of co-product production, thermal tolerance, or other factors associated with the commercial production process. We believe we are leaders at optimizing microbe performance to produce molecules at industrial scales.
We achieve these results by applying an atheoretic approach where we systematically edit all parts of the genome without being guided by mechanistic hypotheses of why certain changes might lead to performance benefits. We apply this strategy because while early efficiency gains can be made by analyzing the metabolic pathway and targeting changes in key enzymes, this strategy is generally insufficient to reach commercial performance. Raw DNA sequences are virtually uninterpretable and cannot be manipulated or debugged like computer software code. We have typically found that more than 60% of the beneficial changes in microbes we introduced with our machine learning processes defy known human explanation, even ex post facto, and were only identifiable through powerful machine learning.
This process of radical empiricism involves several key steps:
A.Generate a large library of atheoretic designs.
Our process generally starts with a machine learning system that proposes a specific library of possible genomic edits. These recommendations include library type (e.g. deletions, insertion, etc.), loci in the genome and a number of other variables. Each recommended library would typically encompass hundreds to thousands of specific microbes. While informed by host-specific features, our algorithms do not rely on mechanistic understanding of each gene’s function.
B.Build the recommended library.
In silico designs, however, only go so far; we must actually build (and then test) our microbes to have confidence in our results. And, because we routinely probe hundreds to thousands of loci within the genome for potential improvements in performance, we have had to develop custom software tools to facilitate work at this scale. These tools include software that enables us to design the large libraries of specified microbes, run lab operations, and perform subsequent batch analyses. Our robots use a number of molecular biology techniques—which vary by microbe—to assemble DNA constructs and insert them into pre-specified loci in the genome. To date we have built and tested 450,000 microbes with specific genomic edits. This excludes microbes we have built using random mutagenesis and other non-targeted methods. 
C.Evaluate microbe improvement and predict performance at scale.
Once fabricated and quality controlled, these new microbes must be evaluated experimentally to determine their performance. This process is challenging for two reasons: first, standard high throughput assays do not resemble performance at scale because the physical environment of a 3ml microtiter plate well in a lab is very different from the conditions in a 100,000 liter full scale manufacturing environment; and second, our detection methods must be exceptionally precise since performance gains from any individual edit may be quite small. Our testing platform is able to use data collected over years of experiments to predict how microbes will perform at scale based on high-throughput, small-scale experiments. This allows us to identify winning variants with a high degree of accuracy.
We use a machine learning system called Orion to design our assays. Each microbe and molecule requires its own set of test assays, and these assays must be periodically refreshed as we climb the performance curve. These assays provide insight into fermentation characterization (e.g., concentrations of nutrients, intermediates and byproducts), microbe growth and health (e.g., cell density, cell size, growth rate) and target production (e.g., yield, titer, productivity). We utilize a broad array of analytical techniques which may include spectroscopy, colorimetric assays, mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magenetic Resonance, and a range of separation techniques (e.g., chromatography). In addition to classical analytical chemistry, we may also use cell-based assays, such as FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) and technologies such as biosensors where appropriate. Factors such as precise nutrient composition in the media or the cultivation time points used for assaying can have a significant impact on the predictability of the assay relative to larger-scale fermentation and must be carefully tuned. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

We then confirm our results by performing bench-scale fermentation runs. Each process run in bench-top reactors is monitored by our active data capture process which builds a continuous digital model of every fermentation run and is associated with microbe and genetic edit data stored in our Laboratory Information Management System (“LIMS”). This data relationship enables us to better understand the way that incremental genetic change affects the performance of a particular fermentation process. These runs also offer us the ability to iterate on the fermentation process itself; our in-house machine learning tool set runs a complex set of analyses on the fermentation run data and digital models of our microbes. These analyses highlight key issues that guide subsequent process and genetic changes. Our process consistently finds genomic edits that improve performance despite the enormous design space. Many of the improvements we identify are not predictable in advance using traditional human-generated hypotheses. For example, across the programs conducted for our largest R&D partner, more than 50% of all genomic edits identified by our platform were not predictable using traditional human-generated hypotheses.
Our platform is an end-to-end solution based on a common infrastructure.
Our technology platform has been built as a set of discrete applications that solve the challenge of designing products, creating microbes, and scaling production. These applications, however, are built on a shared infrastructure.
The most important pieces of this infrastructure are:
Unified Metagenomics Database (UMDB)
UMDB is a digital and physical collection of DNA with approximately 300 million genes, and is the extension of the metagenomic capabilities of Radiant Genomics, Inc., a company we acquired in 2017. This database is a deep, rich repository of enzymes incorporating both publicly available enzyme information and enzymes discovered first by Radiant and now by us. Since acquiring Lodo Therapeutics in 2021, we have further extended our UMDB to incorporate metagenomic data from Lodo Therapeutics’ metagenomic libraries. Our UMDB is one of the largest collections of its kind, and it is continually growing. For many but not all of the enzymes, we possess associated functional information based on prior published research. For enzymes without functional information, we use sequence similarity, the identity of neighboring genes in the genome, and other information to predict likely enzymatic function. We utilize the information from UMDB in, among other things, predicting molecules which can then be searched by ZYNC and providing a source of data for APE to design pathways.
Reconfigurable Automation Carts & Automation Control Software
Our RAC system is a collection of modular hardware building blocks that allow for assembly of work cells customized for the particular needs of a lab. The system is configurable, scalable, and mobile, advancing the state of the art in lab automation. 
ACS is our custom software orchestration layer for RACs. ACS is cloud-based and remotely controls collections of instruments (including the RAC system itself) to optimize work schedules, execute and monitor lab workflows, and centralize data. 
RAC and ACS are described in more detail in “—Automation.”
Laboratory Information Management System
LIMS is a cloud-scale database that we have been running and extending since 2014. LIMS captures experimental designs, instrument execution and run parameters, relevant environmental conditions, and data as it is generated by our high throughput lab. This multi-year data repository enables us to perform analyses and train machine learning systems on an incredibly rich data set of, among other things, genotype:phenotype correlations and lab process metadata. This proprietary data moat expands every day in both depth and breadth.
MANUFACTURING
We rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) to manufacture our products and anticipate continuing to do so for the foreseeable future. We do not have our own commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We oversee our manufacturing production and activities at CMOs using internal personnel, CMO resources, and other contract services with technical, manufacturing, analytical, and quality experience. In some cases, we also utilize consultants when we believe unique expertise would be beneficial. We are working to expand and strengthen our network of CMOs with a near-term focus on fermentation and down-stream processing. CMOs often have long lead times and our products often require complex technology transfer during manufacturing scale-up. When possible, we are targeting CMOs with both fermentation and downstream processing capability, and who have the ability to span a wide range in scale, to reduce the number of transfers in the manufacturing process and the associated risks and additional time requirements. We also target manufacturers that have capacity to produce multiple products for us over time. Where appropriate we may also rely on partners for manufacturing.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Longer term, one of our key imperatives is to drive down the cost of manufacturing synthetic biology products. We also plan to increase manufacturing value capture and accelerate time to market by vertically integrating pilot scale fermentation.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
To date, we have filed approximately 500 patent and provisional patent applications, of which approximately 361 are currently pending. These include patents and pending applications that generally relate our innovations in the areas of:
•High Throughput (HTP) screening platform and discovery tools, including our HTP genomic engineering platform and automated HTP tools for exploring genomic space, as well as HTP screening hardware components such as electroporators, robotics and instruments and our platform for sourcing natural products from metagenomic libraries;

•automation devices, systems and software, including for scalable and mobile RACs designed to process materials such as biological or chemical materials using HTP approaches.
In the United States, patent rights generally have a term of twenty years from the date in which they were filed as non-provisional patent applications.
In addition to our proprietary methods and technologies, we also license certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications from various third parties. Some of these license agreements provide the exclusive right to practice the licensed intellectual property subject to specific field or territory restrictions and certain fee and royalty arrangements. Subject to common termination rights, these exclusive license agreements typically are in force until the last of the licensed patents expires or, in some cases, upon our failure to achieve specified sales volume thresholds.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. We cannot provide any assurance that any of our current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, or that any of our current or future issued patents will effectively protect any of our products or technology from infringement or prevent others from commercializing infringing products or technology.
We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also bar them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

COMPETITION
We design, develop and commercialize microbes, molecules, and materials that can be used to create new products and deliver value to customers in a broad range of industries, including electronics, packaging, healthcare, agriculture, and other categories. To our knowledge, there are currently no other companies that serve these industries with the same breadth or with a comparable platform. Competing platforms may emerge from various sources, including synthetic biology companies, biopharma companies, and public and private research institutions. Some incumbents and emerging, narrowly-focused biotech companies that compete with us on a product / market vertical basis. We expect our novel bio-based products to compete with materials produced using traditional chemical processes.
Across our markets, we believe customers place value on, among other things:
•Product quality and performance advantages
•Price
•Security of supply
•Sustainability / ability to deliver products with a smaller environmental footprint 
We expect our products to target the agriculture, packaging, advanced polymers, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and lab automation industries, among others.
Advanced Materials
Agriculture
We expect the agriculture products in our pipeline to compete with traditional synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and traditional chemical-based crop protection products such as herbicides. Our competitors in this market are global agrochemical companies that produce traditional chemical-based agriculture products. In addition, some global agrochemical companies have created partnerships with start-ups to develop non-traditional nitrogen fixation technology.
Water Repellency
The packaging industry is innovating at different levels of the value chain to create better performing paper-based products. This includes chemical and material science companies creating novel coatings and treatments, paper manufacturers developing new substrates, and converters creating novel final products. Based on current data, we have not identified any raw material companies that may capture significant market share in the short-term in the paper straw market. We expect to face competition from plastic straws, which is a large and fragmented market. Specifically, with respect to paper straws, we expect to face competition from paper companies such as Stora Enso, Georgia-Pacific, and Mondi, as well as coating companies that provide barrier technologies.
Advanced Polymers
3D Printing
Our advanced polymer products are designed for various uses and applications, but we are primarily targeting end parts and tooling for defense, aerospace, and high-end automotive. Our primary competitors in the high-performance polymer segment are Ultem PEI (Sabic), PEKK (Arkema) and PEEK (Victrex).
Electronics
There are two leading material options for the cover window component in the foldable display panels used by smartphones and notebooks. They are Ultra-Thin Glass (“UTG”) and colorless polyimide (“CPI”). UTG has significant share of the cover material market with high adoption among Korea-based handset manufacturers. As Chinese brands ramp up sales of their foldable devices, we expect that their selection of CPI will take some share, while UTG is expected to retain the majority of the market. UTG competitors include Schott and Corning, while CPI competitors include Kolon.
Healthcare - Enzymes
The competitor and competitive alternative landscape is rapidly evolving with respect to enzymes for mRNA vaccine production. Incumbents include New England Biolabs, Hongene, and Tinzyme, with ThermoFisher and Aldevron expected to enter this market. We believe our strain engineering capabilities enable us to compete in this space. A technology alternative to VCE and 2’-O-MT is a synthetic capping solution, the market leader for which is TriLink’s CleanCap product. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Drug Discovery
We anticipate that our drug discovery products will compete with traditional drug makers. Our competitors in this market are global pharmaceutical companies with capabilities that may include small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, novel modalities, and in some cases, natural products. In addition, some global pharmaceutical companies have created partnerships with smaller, natural product drug discovery companies. We are aware that other companies, organizations, and persons have developed technologies that appear to have some similarities to our platform. For example, LifeMine Therapeutics and Hexagon Biomay are attempting to access fungal natural products using genome-mining. To the best of our knowledge, neither has access to the bacterial metagenome that we are mining for our novel natural products. Academic and research institutions may also develop technologies that compete with our drug discovery business.
Automation
Customers seeking to automate their lab operations will often combine layers of the life sciences automation technology stack by engaging with multiple vendors. For example, they might use one vendor for instrument control, another for data handling, another for workcell management, and so on. Our automation offering seeks to provide a unified and comprehensive set of products to address all layers of the stack. To our knowledge, we are the only company aiming to do this. Our competitors are the various vendors addressing individual layers of the stack. In particular, there are competitor companies that offer single or multi-workcell management: Strateos, ThermoFisher Scientific, HighRes Biosolutions, and Biosero. 
For more information about our competitive landscape, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We expect to face competition for our products from established enterprises and new companies, and if we cannot compete effectively against these companies, products or prices, we may not be successful in bringing our products to market.”
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
Environmental Regulations
Our development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals and regulated and non-regulated biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, exposure or pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. Future developments, including the commencement of or changes in the processes relating to commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions, may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.”
Agricultural Regulations
The U.S. government agencies primarily responsible for overseeing the products of modern agricultural biotechnology are the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and the EPA. In addition, some products are regulated at the state level by state Departments of Agriculture. Our future bio-differentiated agricultural products may be subject to the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies. Those requirements will vary depending on the particular product, the mode of action and intended use of the product for commercial purposes.
Currently, we are subject to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) regulations regarding the R&D use of some of our microorganisms. APHIS is responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural health, including protecting agricultural plants from pests, diseases and noxious weeds. Accordingly, under the Plant Protection Act, USDA APHIS has regulatory oversight over organisms and products of modern biotechnology, including those produced through genetic modifications, that are known or suspected to be plant pests or pose a plant pest risk to domestic agriculture and native plants. As some of our microorganisms are considered regulated articles by APHIS, we are required to obtain the necessary APHIS permits prior to their use. Any future regulated microorganism we wish to use will also be subject to the same requirement for an APHIS permit. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may not be able to obtain, or may experience significant delays or costs in obtaining, regulatory approval for our products or their components and even if approvals are obtained, complying on an on-going basis with numerous regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and costly.”
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Chemical Regulations
Our bio-differentiated products use chemical substances that may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. The chemicals used to manufacture ZYM0101 and ZYM0102 are currently subject to U.S. EPA chemical regulations. Specifically, the EPA administers the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can commercially produce or distribute a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution is permitted. If not, then in most cases a pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA. Similarly, in the European Union we are subject to Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (“REACH”) regulation, which is administered by the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). REACH requires companies to identify and manage risks linked to chemicals and chemical substances that we manufacture, import, or market in the EU and to demonstrate to ECHA how the substance can be safely used. Although there are prescribed regulatory timelines with most agencies, the process may result in significant delays or significant costs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may not be able to obtain, or may experience significant delays or costs in obtaining, regulatory approval for our products or their components and even if approvals are obtained, complying on an on-going basis with numerous regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and costly.”
GMO and GMM Regulations
The use of genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) and genetically modified microorganisms (“GMMs”) are subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the federal agencies governing the commercial use of GMOs and GMMs as well as potential products made from GMOs and GMMs include, among others, the USDA, the FDA and the EPA. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMOs and GMMs as well. We expect to encounter GMO and GMM regulations in most, if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our genetically modified or genetically derived products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. In addition, such regulations may change over time. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using our GMOs or GMMs, then our business will be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may face risks relating to the use of our genetically modified organisms and microorganisms and if we are not able to secure regulatory approval or if we face material ethical, legal and social concerns about use of our GMO or GMM technology, our business could be adversely affected.”
Pharmaceutical Regulations
Any future products for the pharmaceutical market may be subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are manufactured, sold or proposed to be sold. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), the FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety, efficacy and security of drugs, biological products and medical devices by regulating the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of these products. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a recall of illegal products from the market and to request the United States Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts. Failure to obtain requisite approval from, or comply with the laws and regulations of, the FDA or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could prevent us from fully commercializing certain of our products. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may not be able to obtain, or may experience significant delays or costs in obtaining, regulatory approval for our products or their components and even if approvals are obtained, complying on an on-going basis with numerous regulatory requirements will be time-consuming and costly.”
Other Regulations
We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, labor and employment laws and our end-user products are subject to the regulations of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are sold or proposed to be sold regarding the advertising of such products. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. The FTC has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations applicable to cosmetics, including the ability to institute enforcement actions which often result in consent decrees, injunctions and the payment of civil penalties by the companies involved. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the FTC or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to market our end-user products.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

We are unable to predict whether any agency will adopt any laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors —Risks Related to Our Business—Governmental trade controls, including export and import controls, sanctions, customs requirements and related regimes, could subject us to liability or loss of contracting privileges or limit our ability to compete in certain markets.”
HUMAN CAPITAL
Human Capital Strategy
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our success. We strive to build a culture that supports collaboration, learning, and innovation, with a goal of attracting, developing, and challenging amazing people.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”)
We believe the diversity of humankind is needed to be successful in our mission. We take an intentional, data-driven, action-oriented, and innovative approach with a goal of attracting, engaging, and developing a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community. We aim to build a company where every Zymergen employee has a sense of belonging and is operating at their full potential.
We are focused on DEI throughout the employee lifecycle and along five primary dimensions: data, processes, programs, Zymergen community, and the external community. To set the strategic course for our DEI initiatives, we have established a DEI Council, which includes our Chief People Officer and we expect will include our CEO once our permanent CEO is hired. This Council guides our DEI efforts by articulating and establishing priority areas, sharing progress, and building broad community engagement. A DEI working group was also established to help execute on the Council’s strategic vision. Their efforts include conducting periodic internal audits to assess our progress against DEI goals and launching learning and development courses to foster discussion among our employees about difficult topics. 
Overall, our aim is to integrate attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work, so that it becomes, quite literally, part of everyone’s job.
Recruiting, Hiring, Development & Retention
We devote significant resources and attention to identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating talented and experienced individuals. To attract and maintain talent, we provide generous packages that include comprehensive health insurance, family-friendly and flexible work policies, wellness resources and activities, community clubs, and opportunities for professional development and career mobility, among other benefits. We design our cash and equity compensation packages to be competitive with other biotechnology companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
In order to foster strong relationships with our employees, we conduct regular employee engagement surveys and maintain channels for providing upward feedback. We also have a learning and development department that curates courses for our employees covering a number of different topics, from technical seminars to health and wellness teachings. 
COVID-19 employee safety and benefits.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and adapted measures to protect our workforce. Many of our employees, including members of our management team, have been working remotely during this time. Throughout 2020 and 2021, we provided COVID 19 testing at no cost to our employees. For certain employees who report on-site, we have implemented health screening protocols, as well as a number of on-site health and safety measures designed to address COVID-19 risks. For additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
Employee Health & Safety
Workplace health and safety are of paramount importance in all aspects of our work and especially in the laboratory setting. During onboarding, all new hires receive our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics and Employee Handbook and take workplace safety training. Employees are then annually asked to review and confirm their understanding of the Code of Business Conduct & Ethics and our Employee Handbook, which includes a requirement that they abide by all company policies. We also conduct periodic training to reinforce workplace safety procedures among our employee population. We have an onsite Environmental, Health & Safety team that partners with employees to promote the safety of our environment and its people, processes, and infrastructure.
