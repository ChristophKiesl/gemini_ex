Item 1. Business
We meet the conditions specified in General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-K and are thereby permitted to use the reduced disclosure format for wholly-owned subsidiaries of reporting companies specified therein. Accordingly, in lieu of the information called for by Part I Item 1 “Business,” we have included a brief description of the business transacted during the most recent fiscal year that in our management’s opinion indicates the general nature and scope of our business.
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in June 2006. In April 2018, Archrock completed the acquisition of all of our outstanding common units that it did not already own and, as a result, we became its wholly-owned subsidiary.
We are a leading provider of natural gas compression services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry throughout the U.S. Our business supports a must-run service that is essential to the production, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas. Our geographic diversity and large fleet of natural gas compression equipment enable us to provide reliable contract operations services to our customers throughout the U.S. We operate in one segment.
We do not have any employees. Pursuant to our Omnibus Agreement with Archrock, we reimburse Archrock for the allocated cost of its personnel who provide direct and indirect support for our operations.

Contract Operations Services Overview
We provide comprehensive contract operations services including the personnel, equipment, tools, materials and supplies to meet our customers’ natural gas compression needs. 
Natural gas compression is a mechanical process whereby the pressure of a given volume of natural gas is increased to a desired higher pressure for transportation from one point to another. It is essential to the production and transportation of natural gas. Compression is typically required several times during the natural gas production and transportation cycle including (i) at the wellhead, (ii) throughout gathering and distribution systems, (iii) into and out of processing and storage facilities and (iv) along intrastate and interstate pipelines. Our service offerings focus primarily on the wellhead, gas lift and midstream applications within the cycle.
Our contract operations services are based on the operating specifications at the customer location and each customer’s unique needs and include designing, sourcing, owning, installing, operating, servicing, repairing and maintaining the equipment. We repackage or reconfigure our existing fleet to adapt to our customers’ compression needs and work closely with our customers’ field service personnel so that the compression services can be adjusted to efficiently match changing characteristics of the reservoir and the natural gas produced. We primarily utilize reciprocating compressors driven by natural gas-powered engines. 
The following table summarizes the size of our natural gas compression fleet as of December 31, 2019:

 | Number of Units | Aggregate Horsepower (in thousands) | | % of Horsepower
0 — 1,000 horsepower per unit | 3,889 | | 1,049 | | 26 | %
1,001 — 1,500 horsepower per unit | 1,439 | | 1,936 | | 48 | %
Over 1,500 horsepower per unit | 531 | | 1,066 | | 26 | %
Total | 5,859 | | 4,051 | | 100 | %
