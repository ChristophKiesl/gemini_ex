Carrier.  Carrier customers are often referred to as wholesale customers and include national operators such as AT&T and Verizon, Local Exchange Companies that need to access locations within Frontier’s footprint, Competitive Local Exchange Companies (CLECs) and wireless carriers.  Carrier customers buy both voice and data services.  
 ﻿
 Services and Products
 ﻿
 We offer a broad portfolio of communications services for residential and business customers.  These services are offered on either a standalone basis or in a bundled package, depending on each customer’s needs.  
 ﻿
 Data and Internet services. We offer a comprehensive range of broadband services. The principal residential service we provide is broadband internet service. Commercial services include Ethernet, Dedicated Internet, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) data transport services and optical transport services. These services are all supported by 24/7 technical support and an advanced network operations center. We also offer wireless broadband services (using unlicensed spectrum) in select markets utilizing networks that we own or operate.  In addition, we offer our Frontier Secure suite of products, including computer security, cloud backup and sharing, identity protection and equipment insurance.
 ﻿
 Video services. We offer video services under the Vantage brand to certain of our customers in portions of Connecticut, South Carolina, Minnesota, and Illinois and under the FiOS® brand in portions of California, Texas, Florida, Indiana, Oregon and Washington. We also offer satellite TV video service to our customers under an agency relationship with DISH® in all of our markets. 
 ﻿
 Voice services. We provide voice services, including data-based VoIP, long distance and voice messaging services, to residential and business customers in our markets.  These services are billed monthly in advance. Long distance service to and from points outside our operating properties are provided by interconnection with the facilities of interexchange carriers.  Our long distance services are billed in advance for unlimited use service and on a per minute-of-use basis for a fixed number of minutes.
 ﻿
 We also offer packages of communications services.  These packages permit customers to bundle their products and services, including voice service, video and Internet services, and other product offerings.
 Access services.  We offer a range of access services.  Our switched access services allow other carriers to use our facilities to originate and terminate their local and long distance voice traffic. These services are generally offered on a month-to-month basis and the service is billed primarily on a minutes-of-use basis. Switched access charges have been based on access rates filed with the FCC for interstate services and with the respective state regulatory agency for intrastate services.  Intercarrier compensation reform has impacted the rates that we may charge for these services. See, “Regulatory Environment” below.  Other access services we offer, such as special access, allow other carriers to have a continuous, non-switched connection to customers within our service territory.          Customer Premise Equipment.  We offer our SME customers third-party communications equipment tailored to their specific business needs by partnering with Mitel, Airbus, Avaya, Hewlett Packard, Adtran and other equipment manufacturers. CPE is typically sold in conjunction with voice, data and Internet services, and may also be sold on a standalone basis.  
 ﻿
 Frontier Operating Strategies
 ﻿
 Grow Broadband and Invest in our Network.  A main component of our strategy is to enable and strengthen the broadband capabilities of our network.  We focus on broadband as the core growth component of our service offering, either bundled with our voice and/or video services, or on a standalone basis.  We continuously improve our broadband speeds and availability in our markets and view these investments as opportunities to attract and retain a greater number of customers and increase average revenue per residential and business customer.  Our capital expenditures include enhancing the existing outside plant by expanding fiber-based infrastructure throughout our network, upgrading network hardware, expanding transport capacity of our middle-mile and data backbone, and growing our video capabilities.  We continue to deploy next generation Broadband Remote Access Servers throughout our network to facilitate the expansion of broadband and video service offerings and increase broadband speeds. Similarly, for our commercial customers we are focused on expanding and upgrading our premium Ethernet service offerings across our network.

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Improve Customer Experience and Retention. We provide multiple service and product options in our residential and business offerings to the customer base in each of our markets. We believe this strategy results in a better customer experience and allows us to maximize retention of existing customers and to attract new customers. At December 31, 2016, 63% of our residential broadband customers subscribed to at least one other service offering. Our bundled services include broadband, voice, and video offerings, including simplified messaging services, higher speed products and digital security products.  In late 2016, we announced a new organization structure, including separate and specialized consumer and commercial operations which will focus on the differing needs of these customer groups. 
 ﻿
 Improve Productivity and Operational Efficiency.  We continuously engage in productivity initiatives with a focus on simplifying our processes, eliminating redundancies and further reducing our cost structure while improving our customer service capabilities.  We have achieved significant day one cost savings in the wireline acquisition in California, Texas and Florida in 2016.  There are substantial operational cost take-out opportunities that we are aggressively pursuing across all of our properties.
 ﻿
 Network Architecture and Technology
 ﻿
 Our local exchange carrier networks consist of host central office and remote sites, primarily equipped with digital and Internet Protocol switches.  The outside plant consists of transport and distribution delivery networks connecting our host central office with remote central offices and ultimately with our customers.  We own fiber optic and copper cable, which have been deployed in our networks and are the primary transport technologies between our host and remote central offices and interconnection points with other incumbent carriers.  
 ﻿
 We have expanded and enhanced our fiber optic and copper transport systems to support increasing customer demand for high bandwidth transport services. We routinely enhance our network and upgraded with the latest Internet Protocol Transport and routing equipment, Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (ROADM) transport systems, Very High Bit-Rate Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) broadband equipment, and VoIP switches.  These systems will support advanced services such as Ethernet, Dedicated Internet, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) transport, and VoIP.  The network is designed with redundancy and auto-failover capability on our major circuits.
 ﻿
 We connect to the households and business locations in our service territory using a combination of fiber optic and copper technologies.  In some cases we provide direct fiber into a residence or a business premises.  In other cases a location is served with a hybrid combination of fiber and copper.  Residences in our service territory are served by fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) and by fiber-to-the-node (FTTN), meaning fiber carries the traffic to an intermediate location where the signals are converted to copper wire for the final delivery to the household.  We provide data, video, and voice services to the customer over both of these architectures.  
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2016, our broadband availability to the households throughout Frontier’s territories is as follows:

﻿ | | 
------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------
(Downstream speed capability) | Number of Households (in millions) | % of Households with capability
﻿ | | 
Up to 10 Mbps | 13.4 | 88% 
10 Mbps and above | 8.9 | 58% 
25 Mbps and above | 6.0 | 39% 
50 Mbps and above | 4.5 | 29% 
100 Mbps and above | 3.6 | 24% 
﻿ | | 
No broadband capability | 1.8 | 12% 
﻿ | | 
Total Households | 15.2 | 

  ﻿
 In certain markets, we have begun to offer residential broadband services with 1 gigabit download speed capabilities.
 ﻿
 Rapid and significant changes in technology are occurring in the communications industry.  Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes. We believe that our existing network 

 
4


 
 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

architecture strategy will enable us to respond to these ongoing technological changes efficiently. In addition, we anticipate reducing costs through the sharing of best practices across operations, centralization or standardization of functions and processes, and deployment of technologies and systems that provide for greater efficiencies and profitability. We will continue to make strategic enhancements to our network, with a focus on higher return investments.
 ﻿
 Competitive Positioning
 ﻿
 Competition for residential customers comes from cable operators, wireless carriers and online video providers, among others.  
 ﻿

- | Cable operators: in a majority of our markets, cable operators offer high speed Internet, video and voice services than we do and compete with us aggressively on speed and price by marketing their offerings with significant promotional period pricing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

- | Wireless carriers: primarily compete with us for broadband, video, and voice services in our markets by offering increasingly larger data packages to mobile customers. The percentage of homes with a landline telephone has been declining, a trend we expect will continue. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

- | Online video providers: many consumers are opting for internet-delivered video services (Over the Top, or OTT) through providers such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, YouTube and DirecTV Now rather than traditional, multi-channel video. In response, we have made investments in our network to deliver OTT video content to consumers who might not opt for traditional video services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Many residential customers prefer to bundle their voice, data and Internet and video services with a single provider.  In areas where we do not directly offer a network based video service, we offer satellite TV video service through DISH.  This can impact acquisition of new customers and retention of existing customers, representing a critical factor for the attachment of video, broadband and voice products. As of December 31, 2016 34% of our residential customers subscribed to at least two service offerings, and 19% subscribed to at least three service offerings. 
 ﻿
 Competition for business customers comes from telecommunications providers, cable operators, CLECs and other enterprises, some of which are substantially larger than us.  As compared to our residential customers, these customers often require more sophisticated and more data-centered solutions (e.g., IP PBX, E911 networks, Ethernet, SIP trunking).
 ﻿
 In order to remain competitive, we must continue to evolve our product offerings to remain current with the changing needs of the market, to provide strong customer service and support, to invest in our network so we maintain adequate capacity and can deliver new capabilities as needed, and to package our offerings to make them attractive to customers. 
 ﻿
 Regulatory Environment    ﻿
 Some of our operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and various state regulatory agencies, often called public service or utility commissions. We expect federal and state lawmakers, the FCC and the state regulatory agencies to continue to revise the statutes and regulations governing communications services.
 Regulation of our business 
 We are subject to federal, state and local regulation and we have various regulatory authorizations for our regulated service offerings.  At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over information services, interstate or international telecommunications services and over facilities to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international services.  State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services and the facilities used to provide, originate or terminate those services.  Most of our local exchange companies operate as incumbent carriers in the states in which they operate and are certified in those states to provide local telecommunications services.  In addition, local governments often regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks, and may require service providers to obtain licenses or franchises regulating their use of public rights-of-way. Municipalities and other local government agencies also may regulate other limited aspects of our business, by requiring us to obtain cable franchises and construction permits and to abide by applicable building codes.

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Some states regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over incumbent telephone companies, and their interconnection with competitive providers and provision of non-discriminatory network access to certain network elements to them.  Under the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, state regulatory commissions have jurisdiction to arbitrate and review interconnection disputes and agreements between incumbent telephone companies and competitive local exchange carriers, in accordance with rules set by the FCC.  The FCC and state regulatory commissions also impose fees on providers of telecommunications services to support state universal service programs.  Many of the states in which we operate require prior approvals or notifications for certain acquisitions and transfers of assets, customers, or ownership of regulated entities.
 ﻿
 In addition, in some states we are subject to operating restrictions and minimum service quality standards (the failure to meet such restrictions may result in penalties).  We also are required to report certain financial information.  At the federal level and in a number of the states in which we operate, we are subject to price cap or incentive regulation plans under which prices for regulated services are capped.  Some of these plans have limited terms and, as they expire, we may need to renegotiate with various states.  These negotiations could impact rates, service quality and/or infrastructure requirements, which could also impact our earnings and capital expenditures.  In other states in which we operate, we are subject to rate of return regulation that limits levels of earnings and returns on investments.  Approximately 19% of our total access lines at December 31, 2016 are in state jurisdictions under the rate of return regulatory model.  We will continue to advocate for no or reduced regulation with various regulatory agencies in those states.  In some of our states, we have already been successful in reducing or eliminating price regulation on end-user services.
 ﻿
 Federal Regulatory Environment    ﻿
 Frontier, along with all telecommunications providers, is subject to FCC rules governing privacy of specified customer information. Among other things, these rules obligate carriers to implement procedures to: protect specified customer information from inappropriate disclosure; obtain customer permission to use specified information in marketing; authenticate customers before disclosing account information; and annually certify compliance with the FCC’s rules. Although most of these regulations are generally consistent with our business plans, they may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.  
 ﻿
 Some regulations are, or could in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals or challenges that could change the manner in which the entire industry operates.  Neither the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us, can be predicted at this time. Regulation can change rapidly in the communications industry, and such changes may have an adverse effect on us. 
 ﻿
 The current status of material regulatory initiatives is as follows:
 ﻿
 Federal High-Cost Subsidies: The FCC has adopted rules changing the eligibility requirements for federal subsidies offered to wireline carriers providing service to high-cost, low-density markets, as well as the amounts of such subsidies, as follows:
 ﻿
 Connect America Fund (CAF):  On November 18, 2011, the FCC adopted the Universal Service Fund (USF)/Intercarrier Compensation (ICC) Report and Order (the 2011 Order), which changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed, and began the transition of Federal USF (Universal Service Fund), which supported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF, which supports broadband deployment in high-cost areas.  Frontier received $133 million from 2012 through 2014 across two rounds of CAF Phase I funding to make broadband available to approximately 194,600 previously unserved or underserved households. We completed deployment of broadband service to the first round of CAF Phase I households in 2015 as required by the FCC rules and will complete the second round of CAF Phase I build by the March 2017 deadline. 
 ﻿
 On April 29, 2015, the FCC released offers of support to price cap carriers under the CAF Phase II program.  The intent of these offers is to provide long-term support for carriers for establishing and providing broadband service with at least 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream speeds in high cost unserved or underserved areas. Frontier accepted the CAF Phase II offer in 29 states, including our CTF properties, which provides for $332 million in annual support, through 2020 and a commitment to make broadband available to approximately 774,000 households.  CAF Phase II support is a successor to the approximately $156 million in annual USF frozen high cost support that Frontier had been receiving prior to the CTF acquisition, and the $42 million in annual transitional USF frozen high cost support that Verizon had been receiving in California and Texas.  In addition to the annual support levels, these amounts also include frozen support phasedown amounts in states where the annual CAF II funding is

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

less than the prior annual frozen high cost support funding.  The frozen support phasedown support was $35 million in 2015 and $27 million in 2016, and is expected to be $17 million in 2017 and $6 million in 2018.
 ﻿
 In 2017, the FCC is expected to adopt a competitive bidding process to continue to distribute CAF Phase II funding in those high-cost areas where price cap carriers declined the FCC’s offer of support, possibly presenting a new support and deployment opportunity.  The FCC’s competitive bidding process has not yet been finalized, therefore, Frontier is unable to determine whether it will participate in any competitive bid process at this time.
 ﻿
 Intercarrier Compensation: In the 2011 Order, the FCC also reformed Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of interstate switched traffic, and began a multi-year transition to the new rates. The 2011 Order provided for the gradual elimination of terminating traffic charges by July 2017 with a related decline in operating expenses. Switched access revenue declined sequentially in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting the rate reductions mandated by the 2011 Order, and we anticipate that we have experienced nearly all of the rate decline related to the 2011 Order.  Frontier has been able to recover a significant portion of those lost revenues through end user rates and other replacement support mechanisms, a trend we expect will continue through 2017 and beyond.  There are no longer any active Intercarrier Compensation-related challenges to the 2011 Order, and we believe that the 2011 Order provides a stable regulatory framework to facilitate our ongoing focus on the deployment of broadband into our rural markets.
 ﻿
 Special Access: The FCC also has an ongoing proceeding, which dates back to 2015, to consider whether to make changes to its regulatory regime governing special access services, including whether to mandate lower rates, change standards for deregulation and pricing flexibility, or to require changes to other terms and conditions.  In connection with its inquiry into specifically identified special access tariff pricing plans discussed below, on April 28, 2016, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on special access or “business data” services.  It sought comment on proposed changes to the way the FCC regulates traditional special access services based on market competition, and on a proposal to adopt pricing rules for Ethernet services in markets that are found to be “noncompetitive.” On October 7, 2016, the FCC released a Fact Sheet detailing former FCC Chairman Wheeler’s proposal for addressing special access issues, though this proposal was never adopted.  The composition of the FCC has since changed following the Presidential election, and as a result the proceeding remains open and the potential impact to Frontier of this proceeding is unknown. 
 ﻿
 On April 28, 2016, the FCC completed its inquiry into whether certain terms and conditions contained in specifically identified special access tariff pricing plans offered by four carriers, including Frontier, are just and reasonable. The FCC held that certain of the tariff terms for business data TDM services, specifically DS1s and DS3s, were unreasonable. Specifically, the FCC struck down “excessive” early termination fees and “all-or-nothing” provisions. Frontier has revised its tariffs in accordance with the FCC’s Order. The FCC’s decision has no retroactive effect, and there has been no material impact to Frontier from it. The FCC deferred the issue of how its ruling will affect customers currently purchasing services from these tariffs to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking mentioned above.
 ﻿
 Intrastate Services: Some state regulatory commissions regulate some of the rates ILECs charge for intrastate services, including rates for intrastate access services paid by providers of intrastate long distance services.  Some states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, some states could consider moving forward with their proceedings.  We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues.  
 ﻿
 Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP):  Regulators at both the federal and state levels continue to address whether VoIP services are subject to the same or different regulatory and intercarrier compensation regimes as traditional voice telephony.  The FCC has concluded that VoIP and facilities-based broadband Internet access providers must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, a decision that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has upheld.  The FCC has also required VoIP providers to provide enhanced 911 emergency calling capabilities.  In the 2011 Order, the FCC determined that VoIP-originated traffic terminating on the Public Switched Telephone Network is subject to interstate access rates. Effective December 29, 2011, the 2011 Order required providers to pay interstate access rates for the termination of VoIP toll traffic.  On April 25, 2012, the FCC, in an Order on Reconsideration, specified that changes to originating access rates for VoIP traffic would not be implemented until July 2014. The 2011 Order was challenged in court, and the FCC was petitioned to reconsider various aspects. While most challenges have been resolved, on November 18, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded to the FCC AT&T’s challenge regarding the ability of competitive carriers to assess VoIP access charges.  The net impact of the 2011 Order during the period from July 

 
7


 
 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

2012 through December 2014 was not significant for Frontier.  The net effect of 2011 Order changes to originating access after July 1, 2014 is dependent upon the percentage of VoIP traffic.
 ﻿
 Additionally, the 2011 Order requires VoIP providers to pay interstate terminating interconnection charges and requires all carriers terminating traffic to provide appropriate call information, thus prohibiting so-called “phantom traffic.”  However, the FCC declined to address other VoIP-related issues, and the FCC has stated its intent to address open questions regarding the treatment of VoIP services in its ongoing “IP-Enabled Services Proceeding.” Internet telephony may have an advantage in the marketplace over our traditional services if this service remains less regulated.  
 ﻿
 Current and potential Internet regulatory obligations: On June 14, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC’s 2015 Order in which the FCC asserted jurisdiction over broadband service, utilizing its jurisdictional authority under Title II and Section 706 of the Communications Act of 1996, classified broadband service as a “telecommunications service”.  The FCC adopted rules to “preserve a Free and Open Internet” (i.e., net neutrality) that impose specific obligations for fixed and mobile providers of broadband Internet access services and specifically prohibit the following: blocking access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration; and otherwise unreasonably harming consumers or edge providers. These obligations are largely consistent with the practices Frontier already had in place. The FCC also announced additional transparency requirements, which allow for a “safe harbor” disclosure framework, intended to provide consumers more information about a provider’s network management practices, performance, speed, price, and data caps. 
 ﻿
 Several parties have asked the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its decision and, depending on the outcome, are likely to ask the Supreme Court to review the Order.  Frontier continues to comply with the existing regulatory requirements, and it is unclear whether the pending appeal will have any impact on the regulatory structure. 
 ﻿
 In addition to the net neutrality rules, the FCC on October 27, 2016, relied on its newfound Title II authority to promulgate privacy rules for broadband providers.  These rules govern how broadband providers can use sensitive customer information and the steps providers must take to protect that information.  Petitions for reconsideration of these rules were due in January 2017, and whether these rules will remain in place is uncertain, particularly due to the change in administration. 
     Video programming  
 ﻿
 Federal, state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry.  Our FiOS and Vantage video services are subject to, among other things: subscriber privacy regulations; requirements that we carry a local broadcast station or obtain consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station; rules for franchise renewals and transfers; the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers; and program access requirements.
 ﻿
 We provide video programming in some of our markets in California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Washington pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local franchising authorities. Most franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach.  In addition, most franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority.
 ﻿
 Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance.  In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations.  We believe that we are in compliance and meeting all material standards and requirements.  Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of at least ten years and must be periodically renewed.  Local franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate.

Environmental regulation
 ﻿
 The local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination.  As an owner and former owner of property, we are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated sites, including sites formerly owned by us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 ﻿
 Segment Information
 ﻿
 We currently operate in only one reportable segment.
 ﻿
 Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales

 We have no foreign operations.
 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 The dollar amount of our order backlog is not a significant consideration in our business and is not a meaningful metric for us.  We have no material contracts or subcontracts that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the federal government.  
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property
 ﻿
 We believe that we have the trademarks, trade names and intellectual property licenses that are necessary for the operation of our business.   
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 28,300 employees, as compared to approximately 19,200 employees as of December 31, 2015.  During 2016, reduction in workforce activities resulted in the severance of approximately 1,950 employees of which approximately 450 employees remained as employees as of December 31, 2016.  Approximately 17,900 of our total employees are represented by unions. The number of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expired in 2016, but have been extended and are still effective for 2017, is approximately 600. The number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2017 is approximately 3,800. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
