Item 1. Business 
 If you’ve purchased apparel from a major retailer like Macy’s or Zara, run a race like the New York City Marathon, enjoyed a drink from a Coca-Cola Freestyle soda fountain, hit a ball at Topgolf or checked bags at airports worldwide like Las Vegas McCarran then you’ve probably interacted with the Impinj Platform. Our platform enables wireless connectivity to billions of everyday items such as apparel, race bibs, golf balls and luggage and delivers each item’s unique identity, location and authenticity to business and consumer applications.
 Overview
 Our vision is digital life for everyday items. Our mission is to connect these everyday items to business and consumer applications. We believe that by expanding the reach of the Internet to items such as retail apparel, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, airline luggage, automotive parts, food – nearly everything – we can improve peoples’ lives.  
 Our platform wirelessly connects these everyday items and delivers each item’s unique identity, location and authenticity – which we refer to as Item Intelligence – to applications like inventory management, patient safety, asset tracking and item authentication. 
 Internet-of-Things 
 We live in a connected world. Smartphones, tablets and other devices share ever-more information over ever-more interconnected radio links, transforming our lives and unlocking unprecedented efficiencies. Advancements in wireless technology, cloud computing, data analytics, search and storage have paved the way for this connected era. However, the items connected today represent only a tiny subset of the items in the physical world. Apparel, shoes, jewelry, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, documents, automotive parts, sporting items and food are among the more than a trillion such everyday items which are now connectable to the digital world yet remain mostly unconnected.
 Our Solution
 We sell a platform that connects everyday items using RAIN, a radio-frequency identification, or RFID, technology we pioneered. We spearheaded development of the RAIN radio standard, lobbied governments to allocate frequency spectrum and cofounded the RAIN Industry Alliance along with Google, Intel and Smartrac. Today, our industry uses the RAIN radio standard nearly exclusively, has access to freely available spectrum in 78 countries representing roughly 96.5% of the world’s GDP and the RAIN Alliance has more than 125 member companies worldwide.
 Impinj Platform
 The Impinj platform comprises a software layer, a connectivity layer and an endpoint layer that together connect items to applications. Within each layer we sell one or more product families. 
Software
 Our software layer today comprises two products, ItemSense and ItemEncode. 
 ItemSense is the operating system for our platform. It extracts Item Intelligence from the connectivity and endpoint layers and delivers that Item Intelligence to business and consumer applications. It also centralizes reader and gateway configuration, management and control through a management application program interface, or API. It is modular, scalable and secure and can operate on-premises, in hybrid-cloud or in cloud-based environments. ItemSense can connect, manage and process data from hundreds of readers or gateways. We have recently begun initial deployments of ItemSense.

ItemEncode encodes item information into endpoint integrated circuits, or ICs. A single ItemEncode-enabled system can reliably encode many tens-of-thousands of endpoint ICs per hour. 
 Connectivity
 Our connectivity layer comprises a family of readers, gateways and reader ICs that wirelessly identify, locate, authenticate and engage endpoints via RAIN. These connectivity products wirelessly provide power to, and communicate bidirectionally with, endpoint ICs, identifying and locating up to 1,000 items per second. 
 Readers and Gateways. Our readers read, write, authenticate or otherwise engage endpoint ICs. Our gateways integrate stationary readers with scanning antennas to locate and track endpoints. Our readers and gateways are easy to deploy and use, can be powered via power-over-Ethernet and are certified for operation in more than 40 countries. Our customers have deployed our readers and gateways in applications ranging from retail inventory-taking to automated fuel filling to shipping-container tracking to airport luggage handling. 
 Our stationary reader product family, branded Speedway, comprises high-performance finished products. We sell our Speedway readers through an established channel of distributors, system integrators, or SIs, value-added resellers, or VARs, and solution providers. Our readers sell for hundreds of dollars.
 Our gateway product family integrates our Speedway readers with beamforming antennas to electrically steer a radio beam like a searchlight. Their always-on, autonomous operation delivers timely Item Intelligence without ongoing labor costs. Our portal gateways, branded xPortal and xSpan, scan doorways or hallways such as front-to-back store transitions, entryways and exits. Our array gateway, branded xArray, scans up to 1,500 square feet of floor space such as in a store, manufacturing facility or hospital room. Our gateways sell for thousands of dollars. 
 Reader ICs. Our reader IC product family, branded Indy, comprises a suite of ICs and systems-in-package, or SIPs, that combine our reader ICs with peripheral circuitry in an easy-to-use format. Our reader ICs and SIPs read, write, authenticate or otherwise engage endpoint ICs; we sell them to original equipment manufacturing, or OEM, and original design manufacturing, or ODM, partners that use them in a variety of products such as mobile or handheld readers, fixed readers, gateways, and RAIN-enabled appliances. We offer easy-to-use APIs, development environments, sample code, drivers and libraries. We sell our reader ICs and SIPs for tens of dollars. 
 Endpoints
 Our endpoint IC product family, branded Monza, comprises a family of miniature radios-on-a-chip that attach-to and uniquely identify their host items. They may include standardized features such as user data storage, authentication, security, loss prevention and consumer privacy, and also may include value-added custom features, all accessible by our platform. Our endpoint ICs power themselves from a reader’s radio waves so don’t need a battery, can wirelessly connect almost any item, are readable to 30 feet without line-of-sight yet sell for pennies.
 Our OEM partners attach each endpoint IC to a thin printed antenna on a paper or Mylar backing, then typically cover the composite inlay with a paper face to form a tag. End customers attach the tag to an item in markets including retail, healthcare, automotive, industrial and manufacturing, consumer experience, food, datacenter, travel and banking. We refer to a tag and its host item as an endpoint. 
 Endpoint ICs differ from traditional silicon ICs in that most endpoint ICs are disposable. For example, when consumers purchase retail items they discard the price tags containing the endpoint ICs. We believe endpoint ICs are the first market for consumable silicon and are a recurring revenue source for us. We have shipped more than 18 billion endpoint ICs to date, including approximately 6.0 billion and 3.5 billion in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Opportunity
 Our opportunity is to connect everyday items to the digital world. That digital world has the capability today to analyze and use data from everyday items, but the infrastructure and processes required to capture and deliver item-level data has historically been nonexistent or labor-intensive, expensive, and ineffective. For example, retailers have not historically had an automated way to track in-store inventory so they have relied on infrequent and labor-intensive manual counts. Similarly, hospitals have not historically had an automated, timely way to track biospecimens so they have resorted to labor-intensive barcode scanning. In these and numerous other examples, a lack of real-time information about item identity and location has increased inventory carrying costs, reduced operating efficiencies, and consumed labor and time.
 Our platform enables capturing and delivering item-level data to the digital world. It is part of a large and growing worldwide infrastructure that produces, encodes and applies tags to items, and connects and extracts timely business value from those tagged items. Two of our many market opportunities, retail and healthcare, demonstrate how our addressable market for item connectivity is large and growing. Frost & Sullivan, a market research firm, forecasts the retail opportunity will grow at a 39% CAGR between 2014 and 2020, reaching $5.4 billion by 2020.  Transparency Market Research, another market research firm, forecasts the healthcare opportunity will grow at a 14% CAGR between 2014 and 2020, reaching $5.3 billion by 2020.  We have additional opportunities in automotive, industrial and manufacturing, consumer experience, government, food, datacenter, travel and banking.
 RAIN market adoption has historically been slower than anticipated or forecasted by us and industry sources. For additional information related to RAIN market adoption, please see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors.”
 Industry Use Cases
 We believe we are the only company selling a platform spanning endpoints, connectivity and operating-system software. The following use cases are representative of actual RAIN deployments we serve.
 Retail
 Retailers, both traditional “brick-and-mortar” and online, are consuming billions of tags each year to obtain real-time Item Intelligence about products they manufacture, transport and sell. By using our platform retailers can obtain these benefits: 

• | Improve Inventory Visibility. U.S apparel retailers historically inferred store inventory using manual counts, store-receipt data and point-of-sale data, typically resulting in 65% visibility based on industry sources. From measured data, RAIN offers apparel retailers better than 95% inventory visibility.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies
 To further our mission of connecting and delivering Item Intelligence for everyday items, we plan to focus on the following strategic areas:
  
• | Continue Investing in Our Platform. Since 2003, we have invested more than $182 million developing our platform. We plan to continue investing in platform functionality, software/hardware linkages, broadening our software capabilities, enhancing platform features such as item authentication and loss prevention and reducing costs. We also plan to enhance our gateway functionalities to help drive gateways as the preferred connectivity devices for retail, healthcare and other industries. Since 2003, investment in our platform comprised: $172 million in research and development expense, $9 million in costs for development agreements and $1 million in capitalized internal-use software.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive End-User Adoption. We plan to deepen our platform integration with software partners and to grow our sales, support and product-development teams. These investments will allow us to expand our engagements with end users in retail, healthcare and other industries and accelerate their adoption of the Impinj Platform. We also intend to broaden our partner ecosystem and expand our solutions focus and offerings. To meet the growing demand for our products, we are expanding inventory and reducing product lead times.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cross-Sell and Up-Sell Our Platform within our Installed Footprint. We believe the majority of RAIN deployments today use one or more of our products, positioning us for future platform cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. For example, retailers that deploy our gateways see improved inventory accuracy when using our endpoint ICs, positioning us to up-sell our platform into these retail accounts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand within our Existing Customer Base. We will seek additional revenue from existing end users of our platform by expanding their deployment scope and adding new use cases. For example, retailers typically start deploying RAIN by tagging apparel. We see opportunities to expand their tagging to housewares, appliances, cosmetics and eventually all items in a store. These same retailers typically choose inventory visibility as their first use case. We see opportunities to extend their use cases for already-tagged items to omnichannel fulfillment, loss prevention, enhanced retail analytics and more.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable Ubiquitous Reading. We plan to invest in next-generation reader ICs to improve functionality, reduce costs, and make Impinj-based readers ubiquitous in industrial and consumer devices and facilities infrastructure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 Our go-to-market model prioritizes brand development, end-user awareness, lead generation and sales enablement. Our communications use web, electronic and channel programs complemented by press initiatives and industry-analyst relationships. Our solutions-marketing, business-development and solutions-architecture teams work with our partner independent software vendors, or ISVs, to enable joint solutions and joint go-to-market selling.

We deliver products and solutions that are easy for our partner ecosystem to sell and deploy. We engender preference for our platform in all sales engagements, encouraging end users to deploy our multiple products to gain full benefit from our platform. Our business development, product marketing, technical and systems engineers all actively engage partners and end customers.
 Our sales force leverages a global partner ecosystem of distributors, SIs, VARs and ISV partners. Each regional sales team sells all of our products. We organize our sales team primarily by geography: (1) Americas, (2) Asia Pacific and (3) Europe, Middle East and Africa. We also have a small number of worldwide sales executives with expertise in endpoint and reader ICs to support the geographic sales teams. Because our operating-system software is still relatively new to the market, the revenue we derive from software is small, so we currently derive most of our revenue from connectivity product and endpoint IC sales. We sell our products as follows:
  
• | Software through distributors, VARs, system integrators and other software-solution partners.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readers and gateways primarily to VARs and system integrators through distributors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reader ICs primarily through distribution to reader OEMs and ODMs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Endpoint ICs directly to inlay and tag OEMs and ODMs. We typically negotiate pricing, volumes and deliveries with these OEMs and ODMs yearly, with new pricing effective during the first quarter of the calendar year.

We engage directly with end users in collaboration with partners across our ecosystem, usually fulfilling sales through those same partners. In some instances, these end-customer engagements leverage go-to-market relationships with companies who do not sell our products but whose product offerings complement ours. Many of our partners sell multiple of our products or our entire platform.
 Manufacturing
 We outsource all our product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers that build our products to our design specifications. This capital-efficient operating model scales efficiently with volume, allowing us to focus our resources on accelerating development of new products and solutions.
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, fabricates our endpoint ICs in Asia and the United States and has been our sole endpoint IC supplier since 2003. We order endpoint IC wafers on a purchase-order basis and do not have a long-term agreement with TSMC. We test the wafers at our U.S. headquarters and in Asia. We use multiple subcontractors to post-process the wafers. Our primary subcontractor for our endpoint ICs is Stars Microelectronics (Thailand) Public Company Limited, or Stars. We generally engage all our endpoint IC subcontractors on a purchase-order basis.
 10


TowerJazz Ltd. fabricates our reader ICs in the United States and has been our sole reader IC supplier since 2008. We order reader IC wafers on a purchase-order basis and do not have a long-term agreement with TowerJazz. We use subcontractors on a purchase-order basis to package the ICs and test the packaged parts.
 Plexus Corp. manufactures our readers in Asia and has been our sole supplier since 2005. Plexus and Western Corporation in the United States have manufactured our gateways since 2013 and 2010, respectively. We order readers and gateways pursuant to nonexclusive purchase agreements that renew automatically each year, subject to each party’s right to terminate upon 180 days’ notice. We engage subcontractors on a purchase-order basis to assemble and test printed circuit boards, to build our reader and gateway enclosures and test our readers and gateways.
 Research and Development
 We built our company around technology leadership and innovation. We have committed, and plan to continue committing, significant resources to technology and product innovation and development. We achieved our market leadership by innovating, delivering and continuously improving product performance, features, quality and reliability while also reducing costs. In most situations, we strive to lead the market with new innovations, but we sometimes adopt a “fast follower” approach depending on the market situation. As one example, endpoint IC performance typically improves when we migrate the semiconductor processing to more advance process nodes. We execute these node migrations when the development costs, performance improvements, competitive situation and product cost reductions justify the migration. But external factors, such as the ability of our OEM and ODM partners to process larger wafers with smaller ICs can cause us to delay, or even allow our competition to temporarily lead, while we develop competitive products that we introduce when our OEM and ODM partners are ready. 
 We have assembled a team of skilled engineers and currently perform all research and most of our product development internally. As of December 31, 2016, we had 107 employees in research and development, of which eight hold a Ph.D. and 34 hold a master’s degree. Research and development expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $25.2 million, $17.6 million and $14.3 million, respectively. We regularly review our technology, products, developments and product opportunities and reallocate our spending and resources accordingly.
 Intellectual Property
 We protect our technologies by filing patent applications, retaining trade secrets and defending and enforcing our intellectual-property rights where appropriate. To date, our intellectual property portfolio includes 204 issued and allowed U.S. patents, 36 pending U.S. patent applications and three pending international patent applications. The first of our 175 issued utility patents expire in 2024 and the first of our 26 issued design patents expire in 2021. To protect confidential information not otherwise subject to patent protection, we rely on trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and partners.
 Because most RAIN products are used in, or imported into, the United States, we believe U.S. patents hold the most value for our business. Consequently, we have filed primarily U.S. patent applications. We have a small number of pending foreign patent applications but none have yet allowed or issued. Because our portfolio currently contains only U.S. patents, we have limited ability to assert our intellectual-property rights outside the United States.
 Although our patents and trade secrets constitute valuable assets, we do not view any one of them as material. Instead, we believe the totality of our patent and trade-secret portfolio creates an advantage for our business.
 11


We have entered into licensing, broad-scope cross-licensing and other agreements authorizing us to use or to operate within the scope of patents and intellectual property owned by third parties. For example, we have licenses to third-party intellectual property that we use in our products. As another example, by participating in developing GS1 EPCglobal protocols, such as the RAIN radio protocol, we agreed to license those of our patents necessarily infringed by the practice of these protocols on a royalty-free basis to other GS1 EPCglobal members, subject to reciprocal royalty-free rights from those members. We believe 14 of our patents and pending applications are necessary to practice the RAIN radio protocol. By participating in developing ISO standards, we have agreed to grant to all users worldwide a license to those of our patents necessarily infringed by the practice of several ISO standards, including non-RAIN standards, on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, subject to reciprocity.
 We own a number of trademarks, develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions.
 Alliances and Standardization
 We, along with Google, Intel and Smartrac, cofounded the RAIN Industry Alliance in 2014. Our chief executive officer is presently an Alliance Director and was previously the Alliance Chairman. The Alliance is a global organization promoting the universal adoption of RAIN technology and solutions with more than 125 members as of the date of this report. The name “RAIN” connotes ubiquity and a close link to cloud data.
 We, our customers, partners and competitors developed the RAIN radio protocol, UHF Gen2 (standardized as ISO/IEC 18000-63) in 2004, with us as the editor. Our community delivered a backwards-compatible update in 2013, again with us as the editor. Our industry uses Gen2 nearly exclusively.
 By participating in GS1 EPCglobal, which produced Gen2, and ISO, which ratified 18000-63, as well as in other standards bodies, we agreed to license certain patents as described in the section captioned “Intellectual Property.”
 Government Regulations
 Government regulations require us to certify our readers and gateways in jurisdictions where they operate. For example, we certify our readers and gateways to Federal Communications Commission regulations to operate in the United States and its territories. Currently, our Speedway readers are certified for operation in more than 40 countries worldwide including the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, South Korea and all of the European Union. Our gateway products have the same or fewer certifications, depending on the recency of the product introduction; we plan to eventually certify them in all countries with compelling market opportunities.
Competition
 We believe we are the only company in our industry with a platform spanning software, connectivity and endpoints. Our competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our business. Our principal competition in our platform layers include:
  
• | Software. Zebra Technologies Corporation, or Zebra, and Mojix.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readers and Gateways. Alien Technology Corporation, or Alien, and Zebra Technologies, Inc., both of which also purchase our reader ICs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reader ICs. STMicroelectronics and Phychips Inc.
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Endpoint ICs. NXP B.V., or NXP, and Alien. In October 2016, Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm, announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NXP. Qualcomm could use this acquisition as an entry point into the endpoint IC market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


The market for our platform and products is relatively new and highly competitive. We believe competition will increase as the market grows and RAIN technology continues to advance. New entrants could enter our market at any time, creating additional competition in the future. The competitive factors that impact our platform and product sales include:
  
• | portfolio, performance, features, lead times, reliability and price;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | support, ease of use and availability of reference designs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | development tools and API availability (except in the endpoint IC market);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | integration and certification with end-user applications; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | company reputation.
--+--------------------

 Although we believe we compete favorably on the above factors, our future competitiveness will depend upon our ability to design, develop and deliver compelling solutions. We occasionally experience competitive pressures due to prevailing exchange rates as our product pricing is denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, our competitive position depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain talent while protecting our intellectual property. For additional information on the risks associated with our business, see “Risk Factors.”
 Employees and Culture
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 245 employees, with 224 of those in the United States, 9 in the Asia Pacific region, 11 in Europe and one in Latin America. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are excellent.
 We use four words to capture the essence of our corporate culture—innovation, action, commitment and team. We believe our culture is essential to the health and success of our business and aligns our employees around a set of behaviors and actions that foster passion and commitment.
 Facilities
 We are headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Our current facility in Seattle has approximately 70,000 square feet under a lease that expires December 2026. The lease provides for an early termination right beginning in December 2022, subject to early termination fees.
 We also lease a design laboratory and demonstration center located in Seattle, with approximately 11,000 square feet. The lease expires October 2018, subject to an option to extend for either one or three additional years. We also have a satellite sales office in Shanghai and California.
 Legal Proceedings
 As of the date of this report, we are not a party to any material legal proceedings. In the normal course of business, we may be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints. We cannot predict whether any resulting liability would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Revenue
 We operate as one operating segment. See Note 10 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report. For financial information regarding our business, see Part II—Item 7—"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
