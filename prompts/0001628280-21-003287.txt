Item 1.  Business

OVERVIEW

We operate in four business segments: Operating Assets; MPCs; Seaport District and Strategic Developments. The combination of these four segments provides both operational and financial synergies. The vast majority of the assets in our Operating Assets segment are located within our MPCs. This helps us achieve scale and, in most cases, critical mass, which leads to pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations; increased ability to attract, hire and retain the best local leadership and leasing teams; flexibility to meet changing customer demands; and enhanced ability to identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In our MPC segment, we plan, develop and manage small cities in markets with strong long-term growth fundamentals. This business involves the horizontal development of residential land and selling the improved acreage to homebuilders for the eventual sale of homes to new residents. Combined, our MPCs span over 80,000 gross acres, with approximately 7,000 residential acres of land remaining to be developed and sold in high demand geographic areas. In addition to the residential land, our MPC segment contains nearly 3,200 acres designated for commercial development or sale to non-competing users such as hospitals. This land is held in our MPC segment until we identify demand for a new commercial development, at which point the land is transitioned into our Strategic Developments segment. 
The operational synergies of combining our three main business segments, Operating Assets, MPC and Strategic Developments, create a unique and continuous value-creation cycle. We sell land to residential homebuilders in MPC, and the new homes they build attract residents to our cities looking for places to work and shop. New homeowners create demand for commercial developments, such as retail, office, self-storage and hospitality offerings. We build these commercial properties through Strategic Developments when the timing is right using the cash flow harvested from the sale of land to homebuilders, which helps mitigate development risk. Once these strategic developments are completed and stabilized, they transition to Operating Assets, which are located across the United States and increase recurring Net Operating Income (NOI), further funding the equity requirements in Strategic Developments. New office, retail and other commercial amenities make our MPC residential land more appealing to buyers and increase the velocity of land sales at premiums that exceed the broader market. Increased demand for residential land generates more cash flow from MPC, thus continuing the cycle. Our fourth business segment, the Seaport District, is one of the few multi-block districts largely under private management by a single owner in New York City. This historic waterfront area is being revitalized and enhanced as a mixed-use neighborhood, culinary and entertainment destination with a focus on unique offerings.
During the second half of 2020, we moved our corporate headquarters from Dallas, Texas, to The Woodlands, Texas, consolidating office space with our largest regional office. Our assets are located across the United States, and we were incorporated in Delaware in 2010. Through our predecessors, we have been in business for several decades. Financial information about each of our segments is presented in Note 18 -Segments of our audited Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Transformation Plan

In October of 2019, following a review of strategic alternatives, we announced our intent to execute a Transformation Plan, comprised of three pillars: (1) a $45 - $50 million reduction in annual overhead expenses, (2) the sale of approximately $2 billion of non-core assets, resulting in an estimated $600 million of net cash proceeds from sale after debt repayment and transaction costs, and (3) accelerated growth in our core MPC assets. 
We have made significant progress on the execution of our Transformation Plan commitments with meaningful reductions in overhead and the disposition of several non-core properties. Since the announcement of the Transformation Plan, we have executed on the sale of eight non-core assets generating approximately $213.8 million of net proceeds after debt repayment. The COVID-19 pandemic has made additional non-core asset sales more challenging to execute and we expect this to continue into 2021. We have continued horizontal development in our MPCs to keep pace with homebuilder demand given the strong underlying home sales in our communities. Additionally, we have commenced investments in pre-development work for the next vertical development opportunities in our core MPCs.

Executive Transition

On September 17, 2020, Mr. Paul Layne retired as Chief Executive Officer and stepped down from the Company’s Board of Directors (Board). At the same time, Mr. David O’Reilly, the Company’s President and Chief Financial Officer, was appointed to serve as interim Chief Executive Officer. On December 1, 2020, the Company announced that Mr. O’Reilly had been appointed Chief Executive Officer effective December 1, 2020. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Mr. O’Reilly to serve as a Director on the Board effective December 1, 2020. Mr. O’Reilly will not receive any compensation for his service on the Board and will continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer until his successor is duly qualified and appointed by the Board. 
Further on December 1, 2020, the Company announced that the Board appointed L. Jay Cross as the Company’s President. Mr. Cross will be responsible for overseeing the development of the Company's portfolio of master planned communities and mixed-use developments. Mr. Cross joined The Howard Hughes Corporation following his role as President of Related Hudson Yards. In that role, he led the development of a $20 billion, 28-acre project in the west side of Manhattan. Previously, Mr. Cross served as President of the New York Jets and led the development of the $1.3 billion MetLife Stadium, the team's joint venture with the New York Giants. Prior to his work in the New York region, Mr. Cross served as President of Business Operations for the NBA's Miami Heat and was responsible for the development of the AmericanAirlines Arena. 

Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic

The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity including worldwide travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential work activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets, all of which resulted in COVID-19 having an impact on our financial performance in fiscal 2020. As this pandemic endures and continues to have an impact on global economic activity, the extent to which COVID-19 adversely impacts our future business operations, financial performance and results of operations will depend on many factors outside the Company's control. For a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties, impacts and actions taken in response to COVID-19, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other real estate companies through the following competitive strengths:
–Management Team with Track Record of Value Creation. We have completed the development of over 7.1 million square feet of office and retail operating properties, 3,447 multi-family units and 909 hospitality keys since 2011. Excluding land which we own, we have invested approximately $2.6 billion in these developments, which is projected to generate a 9.5% yield on cost, or $243.5 million per year of NOI upon stabilization. At today’s market cap rates, this implies value creation to our shareholders in excess of $1.0 billion. Our investment of approximately $676.3 million of cash equity in our development projects since inception, which is computed as total costs excluding land less the related construction debt, is projected to generate a 23.5% return on cash equity assuming a 4.5% cost of debt, which approximates our weighted-average cost. These investments and returns exclude condominium development as well as projects under construction such as the Seaport District. We exclude condominium developments since they do not result in recurring NOI, and we exclude projects under development due to the wider range of NOI they are expected to generate upon stabilization. In Ward Village, we have either opened or have under construction 2,697 condominium units, which have approximately 91.0% units sold as of December 31, 2020, at a targeted profit margin, excluding land costs, of 27.9% or $0.9 billion .
–Unique, Diverse Portfolio. We own a portfolio with many diverse market leading assets located across 9 states with a combination of steady cash flow and longer-term value creation opportunities.
–Significant Value Creation Opportunity. We own one of the preeminent development pipelines in the world with over 50.0 million square feet of vertical entitlements remaining across our portfolio. This represents approximately 7 times the 7.1 million square feet we have delivered in the last ten years without having to acquire another development site or external asset, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage over other real estate development corporations.
–Flexible Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2020, our total debt equaled approximately 46.9% of the book value of our total assets, which we believe is significantly less than our market value. Our net debt, which includes our share of debt of real estate and other affiliates less cash and Special Improvement District (SID) and Municipal Utility District (MUD) receivables, equaled approximately 40.3% of our total enterprise value. Real estate and other affiliates refers 
HHC 2020 FORM 10-K | 



BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

to partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the development and operation of real estate assets. We finished the year with $1.0 billion of cash on hand. Our strong balance sheet provides substantial insulation against potential downturns and provides us with the flexibility to evaluate new real estate project opportunities.
–Self-Funded Business Plan. One of our key differentiators is our ability to self-fund significant portions of our new development without having to dispose of our recently completed developments. Our residential land sales, recurring NOI and profits on the sales of condominium units generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, which is used to fund the equity required to execute our many development opportunities. Furthermore, we are not required to pay dividends and are not restricted from investing in any asset type, amenity or service, providing further flexibility as compared to many other real estate companies, which are limited in their activities because they have elected to be taxed as real estate investment trusts (REIT). We believe our structure currently provides significant financial and operating flexibility to maximize the value of our real estate portfolio. 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)

Overview The Howard Hughes Corporation is committed to reducing our environmental footprint and fostering thriving neighborhoods while delivering sustained financial returns for our investors. Our ESG program is overseen by our CEO, Board of Directors and ESG Committee. In 2020, we earned the GRESB Green Star designation for the third consecutive year for our ESG leadership.
HHC is dedicated to building a leading sustainability program and has implemented industry-standard targets and performance goals to enhance the environmental performance of our portfolio. Our targets include commitments to reduce energy and water consumption, waste and carbon emissions. We also aim to improve indoor environmental quality and achieve green building certifications as feasible. For further detail, please refer to the Targets & Performance section of our latest ESG annual report which can be found on the Company’s website at www.howardhughes.com/hhsustainability.
Environmental Performance HHC systematically increases the environmental performance of our portfolio through comprehensive environmental sustainability policies and programs rolled out across our properties. We perform strategic efficiency projects that reduce our environmental impact and lower operating expenses. Additionally, we pursue green building certifications for select development and operating properties, including LEED, ENERGY STAR, BOMA 360 and Green Globes. In 2020, we worked with DNV GL Business Assurance USA, Inc. to externally confirm our energy consumption, water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and waste data. 
Resilience In 2019, we conducted a property-level risk assessment across our operating assets. This assessment analyzed over 60 physical, social and climate-related transition risks including but not limited to natural disasters, regulation and market concerns. In 2020, we updated a portion of the risk assessment, and we will continue annual updates in future years. Our other climate resilience initiatives include training building personnel on emergency response procedures, sharing weather alerts with our properties in case of severe weather, incorporating drought-resistant landscaping in dry climates and tracking climate-related legislation, among other items.
Stakeholder Engagement HHC’s stakeholders are integral to the success of our ESG program. We engage our tenants, employees and communities in a variety of ways. This includes incorporating green lease clauses into all leases at our BOMA 360-certified office properties. In addition, we invite our tenants and communities to participate in annual environmental awareness campaigns and Earth Day events, encourage sustainable behavior through our social media channels, share sustainability tips in our tenant newsletters, and provide waste management guidelines to tenants. All HHC employees have access to free, online sustainability education through a partnership with our ESG consulting firm. Through this partnership, we offer sustainability best practice webinars on topics such as energy efficiency, water efficiency and indoor environmental quality. In addition, our employees can access LEED Green Associate exam training. Finally, all employees receive our semiannual ESG newsletter, which includes updates on topics such as green building certifications, ESG reporting, sustainability awareness events and sustainability awards.

Human Capital

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 600 employees, approximately 90 of whom were employed at the Las Vegas Ballpark, which includes seasonal staff required to support ongoing ballpark events and merchandising operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,500 employees, approximately 800 of whom were employed at our hotel properties, the Seaport District and the Las Vegas Ballpark. The significant reduction to our headcount as of December 31, 2020, primarily resulted from outsourcing business operations of our three hotel properties in The Woodlands and the restaurants at the Seaport District to two third-party management companies, and additionally due to the reduction of approximately 80 General and Administrative headcount as a result of our Transformation Plan announced in late 2019.
As a community creator, The Howard Hughes Corporation recognizes people as the lifeblood of our company. We support our people and encourage them to uncover new ways of working and living happy, healthy lives. We offer competitive wellness programs to support our employees and their families, including health benefits, a 401k, a fully paid 12-week maternity leave and four weeks of child bonding leave for both the birth of a child or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. We are also proud to be a mother-friendly worksite, providing a supportive environment and the necessary facilities for nursing mothers. We encourage personal discovery for our team members and advocate for personal and professional growth through tuition reimbursement, student debt management resources and a personal growth fund for non-job-related training. 
Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March of 2020, we instituted an ongoing remote workplace strategy for employees whose job duties are conducive to working from home. We continue to apply a thoughtful, measured and strategic approach that includes the following protocols:
–The Executive Crisis Team (ECT) established and formalized a Welcome Back Task Force and has a standing weekly meeting with the Regional Presidents to share updates on the impact of the pandemic. The collaborative meetings align responsibilities that maintain the safety of our employees, customers and properties, while also assigning tasks to follow-up on and ensure best practices are being considered to respond to the pandemic in a clearly defined, organization-wide unified approach. 
–The status of our data-driven Return to Office triggers are regularly communicated by the Task Force leadership to all employees. The underlying guide to decisions made by the Welcome Back Task Force has always been to consider the health and well-being of our employees first, and to err on the side of caution while respecting the personal circumstances of all employees and offering them reasonable flexibility with respect to returning to the office when they feel safe to do so.
–The Welcome Back Task Force has established Reopening Guidelines addressing policies and procedures pertaining to cleaning, personal protective equipment, social distancing, modifications to work areas, signage and security. These guidelines will be strictly enforced by the Task Force when an office is reopened and are subject to change depending on how the pandemic evolves.
Our Commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity  We believe it is the responsibility of each officer, manager and supervisor to ensure all employment activities are conducted with fairness. We are committed to recruiting, hiring, developing and promoting the best individuals based on job-related qualifications, and without regard to race, religion, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other reason prohibited by law. We do not tolerate differential treatment, and we believe that any practice toward employees or candidates that may get in the way of that duty hinders us all. We provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with a disability, as required by law, under the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable statutes. Sexual or any other type of workplace harassment is not tolerated at HHC, and any employee who engages in discriminatory conduct or workplace harassment is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Diversity and Inclusion  Issues of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) have always been important, but the events of 2020 placed them at the forefront of social issues to be addressed more than ever in recent history. HHC took immediate action to expand upon our existing efforts on diversity hiring and strong partnerships. 
Philanthropy  HHC is highly attuned to how we impact the lives of those within our communities, and we support over 300 causes of local charities through donations and volunteerism. In 2020, we donated over $2 million through our corporate social responsibility program, Howard Hughes Cares (HHCares). We offer all full-time employees 24 hours per year to volunteer, a 1:1 match on financial donations to the charity of their choice and time off to exercise voting rights, all of which reflects our commitment to sustaining the communities where we live and work.
Professional Development We empower employees to grow at every stage of their career. Full-time employees are eligible for up to $10,000 annually in reimbursement for professional growth, including continuing higher education and professional certifications. In addition, conference and seminar attendance is encouraged throughout the Company, to promote networking, learning and firsthand industry experience. Throughout the years, our employees have participated in 
HHC 2020 FORM 10-K | 



BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

hundreds of conferences, including International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) Regional Conferences and South by Southwest (SXSW).
Ethics Compliance Training We believe that strong, well-established ethics are a key tenet of our culture. Training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is required for all employees throughout their time with Howard Hughes. Our training guides employees through engaging in ethical business decisions, recognizing unethical behaviors and reporting when necessary. The training for the 2020 - 2021 year will be completed by all employees within the first quarter of 2021. 
Health and Well-Being We enforce the highest standards for building operations to protect the health, well-being and safety of our employees, tenants, residents and visitors. We are dedicated to improving quality of life by developing properties with healthy spaces to live, work, relax and socialize. We also believe that attracting and retaining the best talent means we must strive to provide an inclusionary work environment in which employees feel valued and safe. 
We are committed to providing affordable benefits for our employees. For 2021, we will focus on bringing more virtual care to employees in light of the pandemic including virtual behavioral health benefits. We are also partnering with a new health and wellness vendor for holistic well-being that will provide an array of discounts and benefits to our employees.
In 2019, we approved and implemented a portfolio-wide Health and Well-Being Guide that provides best practices for increasing indoor environmental quality (IAQ), such as using non-toxic finishes and materials (paint, carpets and furnishings with low volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and providing natural daylight and views for occupants. Also, in 2019, we adopted a Green Cleaning Guide encouraging the use of green cleaning products and procedures at all our managed properties.
Occupational Health and Safety We are continuously evolving to implement processes to improve occupational health and safety practices. Our Risk Management Department hosts discussions with all Operations leadership regarding health issues and risks to employees on at least a monthly basis. The department also hosts at least an annual in-person/onsite training for all employees with respect to Risk Management principles, including safety and security. The Risk Management Department and insurance broker consultants visit each HHC location frequently throughout the year for internal safety inspections. In addition, our regional teams report any safety and security incidents through Case Global, and these reports are shared with the Risk Management team.

Overview of Business Segments

The following further describes our four business segments and provides a general description of the assets comprising these segments. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional details on individual properties, including assets by reportable segment, geographic location and predominant use at December 31, 2020. These sections should be referred to when reading Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which contains information about our financial results and operating performance for our business segments.
Operating Assets We have developed many of the assets in our Operating Assets segment since the Company’s inception in 2010. As of December 31, 2020, we have 76 Operating Assets, including our investments in joint ventures and other assets, consisting of 15 retail, 33 office, 12 multi-family, 3 hospitality and 13 other operating assets and investments. Excluding our projects under construction, we own approximately 10.4 million square feet of retail and office space, 3,840 multi-family units and 909 rooms in our hospitality assets. 
Revenue is primarily generated through rental and hospitality services and is directly impacted by trends in rental and occupancy rates and operating costs. We will also occasionally sell an operating asset when it does not complement our existing properties or no longer fits within our current strategy. We believe that the long-term value of our Operating Assets is driven by their concentration in our MPCs where we have a unique level of control and competitive advantage. We believe these assets have the potential for future growth by increasing rental rates, absorbing remaining vacancy and changing the tenant mix in retail centers to improve gross sales revenue of our tenants, thereby increasing rents.
For certain assets, we believe there are opportunities to improve operating performance through redevelopment or repositioning. Redevelopment plans for these assets may include office, retail or residential space, shopping centers, movie theaters, parking complexes or open space. The redevelopment plans may require that we obtain permits, licenses, consents and/or waivers from various parties. These opportunities will require new capital investment and vary in complexity and scale. The redevelopment opportunities range from those that would have minimal disruption to the property to those requiring partial or full demolition of existing structures for new construction. Factors we evaluate in determining whether to redevelop or reposition an asset include the following: (1) existing and forecasted demographics surrounding the property; (2) competition related to existing and/or alternative uses; (3) existing entitlements of the property and our ability to change them; (4) compatibility of the physical site with proposed uses; and (5) environmental considerations, traffic patterns and access to the properties.
HHC 2020 FORM 10-K | 



BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

We generally transfer an operating asset that is being repositioned or redeveloped into our Strategic Developments segment when we close operations at a property and/or begin construction on the redevelopment project. Upon completion of construction or renovation of a development or redevelopment, the asset is fully or partially placed in service and transferred back into our Operating Assets segment.
Master Planned Communities As of December 31, 2020, we own the MPCs of Summerlin in Las Vegas; The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland in the Houston region; and Columbia in Maryland. Our MPC segment includes the development and sale of residential and commercial land, primarily in large-scale, long-term projects. These developments often require decades of investment and continued focus on the changing market dynamics surrounding these communities. We believe that the long-term value of our MPCs remains strong because of their competitive positioning in their respective markets, our in-depth experience in diverse land use planning and the fact that we have substantially completed the entitlement processes within the majority of our communities.
Our MPCs have won numerous awards for design excellence and for community contribution. Summerlin and Bridgeland were again ranked by Robert Charles Lesser & Co., LLC (RCLCO), capturing third and ninth highest selling master planned communities in the nation, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. See the MPC section of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for details of additional accolades awarded to our MPCs.
We expect the competitive position, desirable locations and land development expertise to drive the long-term growth of our MPCs. As of December 31, 2020, our MPCs encompass over of 80,000 gross acres of land and include approximately 10,151 remaining saleable acres of land. Residential sales, which are generated primarily from the sale of finished lots and undeveloped superpads to residential homebuilders and developers, include standard and custom parcels designated for detached and attached single family homes, and range from entry-level to luxury homes. Superpad sites are generally 20 to 25-acre parcels of unimproved land where we develop and construct the major utilities (water, sewer and storm drainage) and roads to the borders of the parcel and the homebuilder completes the on-site utilities, roads and finished lots. Revenue is also generated through price participation with homebuilders.
We also occasionally sell or lease land for commercial development when we deem its use will not compete with our existing properties or our development strategy. Commercial sales include land parcels designated for retail, office, hospitality, high density residential projects (e.g., condominiums and apartments), services and other for-profit activities, as well as those parcels designated for use by government, schools and other not-for-profit entities.
Seaport District  The Seaport District spans 453,000 square feet and several city blocks, including Pier 17, the Tin Building, the Historic District and the 250 Water Street parking lot. Our Seaport District segment is part non-stabilized operating asset, part development project and part operating business. The Seaport District businesses are comprised of the landlord operations, managed businesses and events and sponsorships categories. As we own, either entirely or in joint venture, many of the businesses, the NOI and stabilization of the Seaport District is less predictable than our Operating Assets segment.
The Jean-Georges marketplace in the Tin Building is the remaining current redevelopment project at the Seaport District. As a result of impacts related to COVID-19, there were delays in construction, however the building is expected to be substantially complete in the fourth quarter of 2021 with opening expected in early 2022, assuming that we receive the necessary approvals on a timely basis. Total estimated aggregate project costs remaining to be spent and funded by us as of December 31, 2020, for the Seaport District projects currently under construction are $143.3 million. 
Strategic Developments  Our Strategic Developments segment consists of 18 development or redevelopment projects, most of which require extensive planning and expertise in large-scale and long-range development to maximize their highest and best uses. The strategic process is complex and unique to each asset and requires on-going assessment of the changing market dynamics prior to the commencement of construction. We must study each local market, determine the highest and best use of the land and necessary improvements to the area, obtain entitlements and permits, complete architectural design and construction drawings, secure tenant commitments and obtain and commit sources of capital.
We are in various stages of predevelopment or execution of our strategic plans for many of these assets based on market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4 properties under construction and not yet placed into service. Total estimated aggregate project costs remaining to be spent on our properties under construction as of December 31, 2020, are $597.7 million, of which $77.8 million remains to be funded by us and the balance will be funded with existing debt. We generally obtain construction financing to fund the majority of the costs associated with developing these assets.

Competition

The nature and extent of our competition depends on the type of property involved. With respect to our Operating Assets and Seaport District segments, we primarily compete for retail and office tenants and hospitality guests. We also compete for residential tenants in our Operating Assets segment. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include: (1) consumer demographics; (2) age, quality, design and location of properties; (3) neighboring real estate projects that have been developed or that we, or others, may develop in the future; (4) diversity of retailers and anchor tenants at shopping center locations; (5) management and operational expertise; and (6) rental rates. The principal factors influencing tenant leasing decisions for our office space include: (1) rental rates; (2) attractive views; (3) walkable retail; (4) commute time; (5) efficiency of space; and (6) demographics of available workforce. For residential tenants of our multi-family properties in our Operating Assets segment, we believe the factors that impact their decision of where to live are: (1) walkability/proximity to work; (2) amenities; and (3) the best value for their money. Our hospitality guests generally make decisions on which hotel they prefer based on: (1) the nature and intention of their trip; (2) brand loyalty; or (3) location and convenience to either an urban or open resort experience.
With respect to our MPC segment, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers primarily in the development of properties within Las Vegas, Nevada; the greater Houston, Texas area; and the Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. markets. Significant factors that we believe allow us to compete effectively in this business include:
–the size and scope of our MPCs
–years of experience serving and strong reputation within the industry
–the recreational and cultural amenities available within our communities
–the commercial centers in the communities, including the properties that we own and/or operate or may develop
–our relationships with homebuilders
–our level of debt relative to total assets
–the proximity of our developments to major metropolitan areas
With respect to our Strategic Developments segment and certain developable assets in our Seaport District segment, including the Tin Building and 250 Water Street, our direct competitors include other commercial property developers and other owners of commercial real estate that engage in similar businesses. With respect to our Strategic Developments segment, we also compete with residential condominium developers. With significant existing entitlements, we hold an advantage over many of our competitors in our markets in that we already own and control, or have significant influence over, substantial acreage for development. We also own the majority of square feet of each product type in many of our markets.

Regulatory Matters

A portion of our business is dedicated to the development and sale of condominiums. Condominiums are generally regulated by an agency of the state in which they are located or where the condominiums are marketed to be sold. In connection with our development and offering of condominium units for sale, we must submit regulatory filings to various state agencies and engage in an entitlement process by which real property owned under one title is converted into individual units. Responses or comments on our condominium filings may delay our ability to sell condominiums in certain states and other jurisdictions in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, approval to develop real property sometimes requires political support and generally entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requires discretionary action by local governments. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. We incur substantial costs to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
Various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the real estate development industry. Our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state and local policies, rules and regulations and their interpretations and application.
There is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. Energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our

operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy related taxes and regulations. Governmental regulation also affects sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. We may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of remediation of certain hazardous substances, including petroleum and certain toxic substances (collectively hazardous substances) on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous substances. The costs of remediation of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to obtain financing using such real estate as collateral. Other federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments, and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with our ownership, operation and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or tanks or related claims.
Substantially all of our properties have been subject to third-party Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs), which are intended to evaluate the environmental condition of the surveyed and surrounding properties. This includes the 250 Water Street property in the Seaport District, which we purchased in June 2018. The Phase I ESA identified historic fill and two probable gasoline underground storage tanks on the property and historical factory and other industrial uses (including a gasoline service station and thermometer factory) on the property and in the area. A limited Phase II Environmental Site Investigation (ESI) for 250 Water Street confirmed the presence of typical historic fill; an anomaly consistent with an underground petroleum storage tank and an associated, limited area of petroleum impacts; and mercury in soil in certain areas above established acceptable background levels. The property’s current use as a parking lot does not require remediation at this time. The property is in the New York State Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) with the Company as a Volunteer (an entity not responsible for the contamination), and will be remediated, as necessary, under the BCP prior to or concurrent with future redevelopment activities. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, neither the ESA or ESI for 250 Water Street nor the completed ESAs of our other properties have revealed any known environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial position or results of operations. Nevertheless, it is possible that these assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that the conditions have changed since the assessments were prepared (typically prior to the time the property was purchased or encumbered with debt). Moreover, no assurances can be given that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on us, or the current environmental condition of our properties will not be adversely affected by tenants and occupants of the properties, by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties unrelated to us.
