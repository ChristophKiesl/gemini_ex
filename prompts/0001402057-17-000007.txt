Item 1. Business
Our Company
CDW Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “CDW” or “we”) is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology (“IT”) solutions in the United States (“US”), Canada, and the United Kingdom (“UK”). We help over 250,000 small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers by delivering solutions to meet their increasingly complex IT needs. Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center, virtualization and digital workspace. We are technology “agnostic,” with a solutions portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands. Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 5,500 customer-facing coworkers, including field sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our “vendor partners”), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
We simplify the complexities of technology across design, selection, procurement, integration and management for our customers. Our goal is to have our customers, regardless of their size, view us as a trusted adviser and extension of their IT resources. We do not manufacture products. Our multi-brand offering approach enables us to identify the products or combination of products from our vendor partners that best address each customer’s specific IT requirements.
We operate in the United States, United Kingdom and Canadian IT markets, which are large and growing markets. Through our acquisition of CDW UK, we can provide IT solutions in more than 80 countries for customers with primary locations in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. According to the International Data Corporation (“IDC”), the total US, UK and Canadian IT market generated approximately $890 billion in sales in 2016. We believe our addressable markets in the US, UK and Canada represent more than $290 billion in annual sales. These are highly fragmented markets served by thousands of IT resellers and solutions providers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we estimate that our total Net sales of $14 billion represented approximately 5% of our addressable markets. We believe that demand for IT will continue to outpace general economic growth in the markets we serve fueled by new technologies, including cloud, virtualization and mobility as well as growing end-user demand for security, efficiency and productivity. 
Value Proposition 
We are positioned in the middle of the IT ecosystem where we procure products from OEMs, software publishers, cloud providers and wholesale distributors and provide added value to our customers by helping them navigate through complex options and implement the best solution for their business. In this role, we believe we provide unique value to both our vendor partners and our customers.

Our value proposition to our customers | Our value proposition to our vendor partners 
● | Broad selection of products and multi-branded IT solutions | ● | Access to over 250,000 customers throughout North America and the United Kingdom
● | Value-added services with integration capabilities | ● | Large and established customer channels 
● | Highly-skilled specialists and engineers | ● | Strong distribution and implementation capabilities

Customers
We provide integrated IT solutions to over 250,000 small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers throughout North America and the United Kingdom. 
We serve our customers through sales teams focused on customer end-markets that are supported by technical specialists and highly skilled service delivery engineers. Our market segmentation allows us to customize our offerings and to provide enhanced expertise in designing and implementing IT solutions that meet our customer’s specific needs. 
In our US business, which represents over 90% of our revenues, we currently have five dedicated customer channels: medium/large business, small business, government, education and healthcare, each of which generated over $1 billion in Net

sales in 2016. Net sales to customers in Canada and the United Kingdom combined generated more than $1 billion in 2016. We believe this diversity of customer end-markets provide us with multiple avenues for growth and has been a key factor in our ability to weather economic and technology cycles and continue to gain market share. 
Information regarding our reportable segments and our customer channels is as follows:

 | Corporate Segment | Public Segment | 
Customer Channels | Medium/Large Business | Small Business | Government | Education | Healthcare | Other 
Target Customers | 100 - 5,000 employees | 20 - 100 employees | Various federal, state and local agencies | Higher education and K-12 | Hospitals, ambulatory service providers and long-term care facilities | Canada and United Kingdom
2016 Net Sales (in billions) | $5.9 | $1.1 | $1.9 | $2.0 | $1.7 | $1.4 

For further information regarding our segments, including financial results, see Note 16 (Segment Information) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
Partners
We provide more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 partners, including well-established companies such as Adobe, APC, Apple, Cisco, Dell, EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., IBM, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, NetApp, Samsung, Symantec and VMware, as well as from emerging technology companies such as Bit9, Calabrio, CloudPhysics, Cradlepoint, Nasuni, Nimble Storage, Nutanix, Proofpoint, Snow, Splunk, Tegile, Tintri and Veeam. This broad portfolio of partners and technologies enables us to offer customers significant choice and meet customer demand for the products and solutions that best meet their needs. We believe our value proposition to vendor partners enables us to evolve our offering as new technologies emerge and new companies seek us as a channel partner.
In 2016, we generated over $1 billion of Net sales from each of four of our vendor partners and over $100 million of revenue from each of thirteen other vendor partners. In late 2015, we expanded our partnership with Dell and now provide their entire suite of products and services across all of our customer channels. We have received the highest level of certification from major vendor partners such as Cisco, Dell, EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Microsoft, which reflects the extensive product and solution knowledge and capabilities that we bring to our customers’ IT challenges. These certifications also provide us with access to favorable pricing, tools and resources, including vendor incentive programs, which we use to provide additional value to our customers. Our vendor partners also regularly recognize us with top awards and select us to develop and grow new customer solutions.
Product Procurement
We may purchase all or only some of the products our vendor partners offer for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer. Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as, purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. We also purchase software from major software publishers and cloud providers for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer. Our agreements allow the end-user customer to acquire cloud-based solutions software or licensed products and services.
In addition to purchasing products directly from our vendor partners, we purchase products from wholesale distributors for resale to our customers or for inclusion in the solutions we offer. These wholesale distributors provide logistics management and supply-chain services for us, as well as for our vendor partners.
For our US operations, we purchased approximately 50% of the products we sold as discrete products or as components of a solution directly from our vendor partners and the remaining 50% from wholesale distributors for the year ended December 31, 2016. Purchases from our three largest wholesale distributors, Tech Data, SYNNEX and Ingram Micro, are each approximately 10% of total purchases. 
Inventory Management
We operate two distribution centers in North America: a 450,000 square foot facility in Vernon Hills, Illinois, and a 513,000 square foot facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada. We also operate a 120,000 square foot distribution center in Rugby, Warwickshire, UK. We ship over 40 million units annually on an aggregate basis from our distribution centers. 
 5

We also have drop-shipment arrangements with many of our OEMs and wholesale distributors, which permit us to offer products to our customers without having to take physical delivery at our distribution centers. These arrangements generally represent approximately 45% to 55% of total consolidated Net sales, of which approximately 20% to 30% relate to electronic delivery for software licenses.
We believe that the location of our distribution centers allows us efficiently ship products to our customers and provide timely access to our principal distributors.
We believe competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of the product categories that we offer.
Competition
The market for technology products and services is highly competitive and subject to economic conditions and rapid technological changes. Competition is based on many things, including the ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, the quality and breadth of product and service offerings, knowledge and expertise of sales force, customer service, price, product availability, speed of delivery and credit availability. We face competition from resellers, direct manufacturers, large service providers, cloud providers, telecommunication companies, and to a lesser extent e-tailers and retailers. Smaller, local or regional value added resellers typically focus on a single solution suite or portfolio of solutions from one or two vendors partners. 
We believe we are well positioned to compete within this marketplace due to our competitive advantages. We expect the competitive landscape in which we compete to continue to evolve as new technologies are developed. While innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Our Competitive Advantages
We believe we have sustainable competitive advantages that differentiate us in the marketplace. We have built a strong sales organization and deep services and solutions capabilities over time and expect to continue to invest in coworkers to enhance these capabilities, which we believe when combined with our competitive advantages of scale and a performance driven culture, will help drive sustainable, profitable growth for us today and in the future. Our scale enables us to have a national and international footprint, as well invest in resources to meet specific customer end-market needs. Our sellers are organized around unique customer end-markets that are both vertically and geographically focused.  Our scale enables our ability to invest in technical coworkers who work directly with our sellers to help customers implement increasingly complex IT solutions.  Our scale also enables us to operate our three distribution centers (two in the US and one in the UK) which combined are more than 1 million square feet in size.  With the acquisition of CDW UK in 2015, we have cross-border relationships that enable us to serve the needs of our US, UK and Canadian-based customers in more than 80 countries. Our strong, execution-oriented culture is underpinned by our compensation system.
Our Offerings
Our offerings range from discrete hardware and software products and services to complex integrated solutions including one or more of these elements. We believe our customers increasingly view technology purchases as integrated solutions rather than discrete product and service categories. We estimate that approximately 50% of our Net sales in 2016 in the US came from sales of product categories and services typically associated with solutions. Our hardware products include notebooks/mobile devices (including tablets), network communications, enterprise and data storage, video monitors, printers, desktop computers and servers. Our software products include application suites, security, virtualization, operating systems and network management. Our services include warranties, managed services, consulting design and implementation.
Today, IT is critical to both “run the business” and drive greater growth and productivity. To help our customers accomplish this, we have built a robust portfolio of solutions across data center, digital workspace, security, virtualization and services that we provide in physical, virtual, or cloud-based environments. 
We provide public cloud solutions which reside off customer premises on a public (shared) infrastructure, and private cloud solutions, which reside on customer premises. We also offer hybrid cloud solutions that deliver the benefits of both public and private solutions. Our migration, integration and managed services offerings help our customers simplify cloud adoption, as well as the ongoing management of cloud solutions across the entire IT lifecycle. Dedicated Cloud Client Executives work with our customers to architect cloud solutions meeting their organizational, technology and financial objectives. These offerings are underpinned by our 24 by 7 network operating centers, as well as services that include cloud planning services and managed cloud. All of these investments help our customers maximize the return on their IT investments.

We offer a broad portfolio of integrated solutions that include the following on and off-premise capabilities:

• | Data Center: We assess our customers data center needs, design flexible, resilient and efficient solutions and manage the solution throughout its lifecycle. Our broad portfolio of hardware and software, for both on and off-premise solutions, enables us to provide a well-integrated solution, including converged and hyperconverged infrastructure, physical and virtualized servers, software defined data center, storage and energy-efficient power and cooling.


• | Digital Workspace: We build solutions that deliver access to applications that improve our customers’ productivity regardless of time or location. We connect our customers’ physical devices, including laptops, desktops and mobile devices, and utilize collaboration solutions to unite communications and applications via the integration of products that facilitate the use of multiple enterprise communication methods including email, instant messaging, presence, social media, voice, video, hardware, software and services. We also host cloud-based collaboration solutions. Our solutions provide the tools that allow our customers’ employees to share knowledge, ideas and information among each other and with clients and partners effectively, securely and quickly. 


• | Security: We assess our customers’ security needs and provide them with threat prevention tools in order to protect their networks, servers and applications such as, anti-virus, anti-spam, content filtering, intrusion prevention, firewall and virtual private network services, and network access control. We also design and implement data loss prevention solutions, using data monitoring and encryption across a wide array of devices to ensure the security of customer information, personal employee information and research and development data.


• | Virtualization: We design and implement server, storage and desktop virtualization solutions. Virtualization enables our customers to efficiently utilize hardware resources by running multiple, independent, virtual operating systems on a single computer and multiple virtual servers simultaneously on a single server. Virtualization also can separate a desktop environment and associated application software from the hardware device that is used to access it, and provides employees with remote desktop access. Our specialists assist customers with the steps of implementing virtualization solutions, including evaluating network environments, deploying shared storage options and licensing platform software.


• | Services: We advise on, architect and manage integrated business technology for commercial and business organizations. Our solutions include integrated cloud, collaboration, data center, mobility and security business technology, from the physical to the application layer. We provide advisory, architectural and managed services across basic, discrete and integrated business technology solutions. We leverage best-in-class partner technology platforms to seamlessly architect and manage disparate IT platforms into integrated business technology solutions. 

Although we believe customers increasingly view technology purchases as solutions rather than discrete product and service categories, our Net sales by major category, based upon our internal category classifications was as follow:

Our Internal Capabilities
Our Coworkers
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 8,516 coworkers with approximately 7,500 coworkers in North America and 1,000 in the United Kingdom. Approximately two thirds of our coworkers at year-end 2016 were customer facing. Over fifty percent of our Net sales are generated by account managers who have greater than seven years of experience. Account managers are supported by field sellers, highly skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. We believe this structure to be core to our ability to continue to offer complex IT solutions and services.
None of our coworkers are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our coworker relations to be good.
Marketing
We market the CDW brand to US, Canadian and British audiences using a variety of channels that include online, broadcast, print, social and other media. We market to current and prospective customers through integrated marketing programs including behaviorally targeted email, print, online media, events and sponsorships, as well as broadcast media. This promotion is also supported by integrated communication efforts targeting decision-makers, influencers and the general public using a combination of news releases, case studies, media interviews and speaking opportunities.
As a result of our relationships with our vendor partners, a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses is reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs. These programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time. We believe that our results and analytical techniques that measure the efficacy of our marketing programs differentiate us from our competitors.
Information Technology Systems
We maintain customized IT and unified communication systems that enhance our ability to provide prompt, efficient and expert service to our customers. In addition, these systems enable centralized management of key functions, including purchasing, inventory management, billing and collection of accounts receivable, sales and distribution. Our systems provide us with thorough, detailed and real-time information regarding key aspects of our business. This capability helps us to continuously enhance productivity, ship customer orders quickly and efficiently, respond appropriately to industry changes and provide high levels of customer service. We believe our websites, which provide electronic order processing and advanced tools, such as order tracking, reporting and asset management, make it easy for customers to transact business with us and ultimately strengthen our customer relationships.
Intellectual Property
The CDW trademark and certain variations thereon are registered or subject to pending trademark applications in the US, Canada, UK and certain other jurisdictions. We believe our trademarks have significant value and are important factors in our marketing programs. In addition, we own registrations for domain names, including cdw.com and cdwg.com and variations thereon, for certain of our primary trademarks. We also have unregistered copyrights in our website content. 
History
Founded in 1984, CDW became a public company in 1993. In 2003, we purchased selected United States assets and the Canadian operations of Micro Warehouse, which extended our growth platform into Canada. In 2006, we acquired Berbee Information Networks Corporation, a regional provider of technology products, solutions and customized engineering services in advanced technologies primarily across Cisco, IBM and Microsoft portfolios. This acquisition increased our capabilities in customized engineering services and managed services.
We were a public company from 1993 until October 12, 2007 when we were acquired through a merger transaction by an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC (“Madison Dearborn”) and Providence Equity Partners L.L.C. (“Providence Equity”). CDW Corporation continued as the surviving corporation and same legal entity after the acquisition, but became a wholly owned subsidiary of VH Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
On July 2, 2013, CDW Corporation completed the IPO of its common stock. In connection with the IPO, CDW Holdings distributed all of its shares of CDW Corporation’s common stock to its members in June 2013 in accordance with the members’ respective membership interests and was subsequently dissolved in August 2013. See Note 10 (Stockholders’ Equity) to the 
 8

accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discussion of the IPO.
Before the IPO, Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity owned 46.0% and 40.6% of our common stock, respectively. After the IPO through secondary offerings and fund distributions, Madison Dearborn and Providence Equity liquidated their ownership positions. As of December 31, 2016 neither firm held a private equity position in CDW. 
 On November 10, 2014, we completed the acquisition of a 35% non-controlling equity interest in UK-based IT solutions provider, Kelway TopCo Limited (“Kelway”.) On August 1, 2015, we purchased the remaining 65% of Kelway’s outstanding common stock, which increased our ownership interest from 35% to 100% and provided us control. Rebranded CDW UK in April 2016, the acquisition extended our footprint into the United Kingdom. It also enhanced our ability to provide IT solutions to US-based customers with multinational locations. Financial results of CDW UK are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. For further details regarding the acquisition, see Note 3 (Acquisition) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
