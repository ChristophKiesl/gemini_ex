Item 1. Business
 
Since January 30, 2017, following a change of control, we have been engaged in the business of developing and marketing nutritional products that promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle. Our business to date has involved the purchase of products from three suppliers in the Republic of China. We sell product in bulk to companies who may use our products as ingredients in their products or sell the products they purchase from us to their own customers. All of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were made to one customer, and all of these sales were made in the first quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
All of our sales to date have been sales of cordyceps related products and, in the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we sold metallothionein MT-3 elizer. Cordyceps is a fungus that is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Cordyceps sinensis has been described as a medicine in old Chinese medical books and Tibetan medicine. It is a rare combination of a caterpillar and a fungus and found at altitudes above 4500m in Sikkim. Metallothionein MT-3 elizer is a protein that, in powder form, is used in health supplements. The encoded protein in metallothionein MT-3 is considered a growth inhibitory factor, and reduced levels of the protein are observed in the brains of individuals with some metal-linked neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. We do not make any claims as to the potential benefits of any of our products. We have not sold metallothionein MT-3 elizer since the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and we do not have any orders for metallothionein MT-3 elizer. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell metallothionein MT-3 elizer in the future. Our inventory at December 31, 2020 is for cordyceps products. We may also seek to market other products which we see as complimentary to our present products; however, we have not entered into negotiations with respect to the distribution of other products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to market any other products.
 
We believe that our failure to sell products during the last nine months of 2020 resulted substantially from the COVID – 19 pandemic and actions taken by governments to address the pandemic. We believe our failure to generate sales reflects a downturn in the market in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) for cordyseps products, and we cannot assure you that the market will improve. We also cannot assure you the political instability in Hong Kong will not affect our sales, since our customers in 2017 and 2018 were Hong Kong-based customers who sold their products in the PRC, and none of these customers has made purchases from us since the quarter ended December 31, 2018. We cannot assure you that these factors will not affect our ability to generate revenues in the future and, to the extent that any of these factors affects our ability to generate revenue, we may not be able to continue in business.
 
During the year ended September 30, 2019, we sold Cordycepin and cordyceps powder to two customers, who accounted for 94% and 6% of our revenue. We did not sell any metallothionein MT-3 elizer products. All sales during the year ended December 30, 2020 were made in the first quarter of the year, and we did not have any sales during the second, third or fourth quarter of the year. In January 2020, we changed our fiscal year from the year ended September 30 to the calendar year. During the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated modest sales which is from sale to one customer who was not a customer during prior periods. All of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents sales to this same customer. We purchased all of our Cordycepin and cordyceps powder from one supplier for the year ended December 30, 2019 and a difference supplier for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our sales are sales of our product in bulk to companies who may use our products as ingredients in their products or sell the products they purchased from us to their own customers. We have not sold metallothionein MT-3 elizer since the quarter ended June 30, 2018.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
As a company with less than US$1.07 billion in revenue for the last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until such date that a private company is otherwise required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering. Since we completed our initial public offering in 2016, we will cease to be an emerging growth company after December 31, 2021.  However, as long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we will be able to take advantage of most of the reduced reporting requirements.  We will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we have either (i) a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) annual revenues of less than $100 million and a public float of less than $700 million.
 
Our Organization
 
We are a Nevada corporation incorporated on September 24, 2014 under the name Killer Waves Hawaii, Inc. On January 30, 2017, we changed our corporate name to Acro Biomedical Co., Ltd. Our address is 12175 Visionary Way, Suite 1160, Fishers, Indiana 46038, telephone (317) 286-6788. Our corporate website is http://acrobiomedicalco.com. Information on or derived from our website or any other website is not part of this annual report.
Proposed Business 
 
To date, all of our sales were made by our chief executive officer, who is our only employee. We plan to develop a marketing program pursuant to which we will seek to:

· | market raw materials to customers, primarily in Hong Kong, who would use our products as an ingredient on their products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | enter into agreements with customers pursuant to which we would develop and supply products which include our ingredients and which meet the specifications of the customer; 
· | develop one or more products which we would sell to retail outlets which would sell our products to their customers or sell the products directly to retail customers as on-line sales.



We do not presently have either a marketing staff or any manufacturing facilities. We intend to develop a marketing staff by hiring a marketing manager and engaging independent sales representatives or hiring sales and marketing and sales personnel or a combination of independent representatives and sales staff. We cannot assure you that we will be able to engage the necessary qualified personnel or to implement an effective marketing program.
 
Initially, we intend to focus on marketing our products to companies in the Hong Kong and Republic of China markets. To date all of our sales have been sales of products which we purchased from our suppliers. In order to market products which would be based our or our customer’s specifications, we would need to provide our potential customers with evidence that we have the capacity to develop and manufacture the products that meet both the customer’s quality specifications and delivery requirements and comply with all government requirements. Since we anticipate that the products we sell will be marketed as over the counter health supplements, both the manufacturing facility, the product and the marketing materials may have to comply with all applicable government regulations in the country in which the products are sold.
 
We do not presently have any manufacturing operations. To the extent that we obtain purchase orders for products, we would need to negotiate an agreement with a qualified manufacturer acceptable to the customer that can deliver the products in accordance with the customer’s specifications, including any required product warranties, and all applicable government regulations and at the customer’s cost set forth in the purchase order. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate any orders for products until and unless we have shown the ability to produce and deliver products of the type that the customer. 
 
At present, we do not have any products that can be sold at retail. We may seek to develop our own proprietary products or we may have a supplier provide us with their products on a private label basis or we may sell a manufacturer’s brand. We cannot assure you that we can develop products, obtain products on a private-label basis or sell any products at retail. To the extent that we are selling products to consumers, whether directly through the Internet, or through retail outlets, we will need to comply with all applicable government regulations in each country in which we sell the products. In this connection, we are considering marketing products in the United States. We presently intend to sell our products in the United States through distributors who sell other non-prescription products and who will be responsible for compliance with the applicable regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). We also plan to market our products using the internet through a website that we plan to set up.  As of the date of this annual report, we do not have any distribution agreements and we have not established a website.  We cannot assure you that we will be successful in establishing any marketing program or establishing a website in the United States.
 
We anticipate that for any products we sell pursuant to an agreement with our customer we will incur liability in the event that the product does not comply with the customer’s specifications or in the event of any product recall. We intend to provide in our agreement with the customer that the customer will be responsible for compliance with all laws applicable to the marketing, sale and labeling of the product. If we sell any products at retail, whether through the Internet or through retail outlets, it will be our responsibility to comply with all government regulations relation to manufacture, marketing, sale and labeling of the products. We will also incur liability in the event of any product recall. The cost of any liability which we may incur may be significant and, if we are found to be liable for any product noncompliance or product recall, we may not be able to continue in business.

Our business plan is in the preliminary stages, and we will require significant funding to implement our business plan, with no assurance that we can or will be successful in developing and implementing our business plan. If we are not able to implement our business plan, our business may be materially impaired.
 
Source of Supply
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased inventory of Cordycepin and cordyceps powder, from one supplier, Aublog Inc., a Taiwan-based company. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased all of our Cordycepin and cordyceps powder from Biospring, Inc., another supplier which is also a Taiwan-based company. We do not have any long-term supply contracts with any supplier, as a result of which our suppliers have no obligation to sell products to us. 
 
Our inventory of $938,000 at December 31, 2020 and our inventory of $878,560 at December 31, 2019 consisted of Cordycepin and cordyceps powder. To the extent that we are not able to sell our inventory, our working capital and financial condition will be materially impaired. 
 
We do not plan to establish manufacturing facilities. We have engaged in initial discussions with potential contract manufacturers in the Republic of China (“Taiwan”) but, as of the date of this annual report, we do not have a formal or informal understanding with any contract manufacturer. If we are able to negotiate acceptable terms for a contract manufacturer to manufacture our products, we would source the raw materials and have the raw materials shipped to the manufacturer who would them customize the product to meet our or our customer’s specifications. However, any product that we may sell may bear the brand names of the manufacturer rather than our brand name. If we are not able to negotiate an agreement with a contract manufacturer, we may buy finished products from a manufacturer, which we anticipate would have the manufacturer’s brand names. Even if we engage a contract manufacturer, we may still buy a manufacturer’s brand products either from our contract manufacturer or another supplier. Our ability to negotiation a contract with a supplier may be affected by both the modest level of sales for the year as well as our lack of substantial sales. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop the necessary relationships with suppliers or contract manufacturers on reasonable terms. Our inability to enter into an agreement with a contract manufacturer may materially impair our ability to implement our business plan.
 
We do not have any arrangement with any supplier to provide us with product for us to sell nor do we have arrangement with suppliers to manufacture products in accordance with specification from potential customers.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
All of our marketing and sales activities to date have been conducted by our chief executive officer, Pao-Chi Chu, who is our only employee and who provides his services on a part-time basis. All sales to date were made by our chief executive officer. We intend to implement a marketing program as described under Item 1. Business – Proposed Business
 
We only had one customer, King Life Biotech Co., LTD, a Taiwan-based company, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which was not a customer in prior years. We do not have any long-term contracts with any customer. We ship products pursuant to purchase orders placed by the customers. 
 
Effects of COVID-19
 
Since our products are purchased by customers in Taiwan and Hong Kong either as one ingredient of a product to be sold to their customers in China or for resale to their customers, our business may be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as it effects manufacturers in Taiwan and Hong Kong and their customers in China. We believe that our failure to generate sales in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 significantly resulted from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and these factors may continue to affect our ability to sell our products. Factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic which may affect the market for our products include, but are not limited to, the following.
 

7


· | The effect of COVID-19 on the ability of our customers and potential customers to manufacture products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The financial health of our potential customers; 
· | Since our customers may use our products as an ingredient in their products, the ability of the customer to obtain other ingredients may affect their willingness or ability to purchase our product. 
· | The ability of our customers to ship their products to China and the ability of their customers to distribute product to retail markets; 
· | The willingness or ability of the ultimate purchaser in China to purchase products with our ingredients and their perception as to whether the products may have beneficial effects to them; 
· | The extent to which quarantine affects the willingness or ability of consumers to purchase products with our ingredients; 
· | The perceived benefit, if any, to consumers of products with our ingredients; 
· | If we seek to market our product in the United States, our ability or the ability of our distributors to comply with, and the effects of, all applicable laws and regulations adopted to address the pandemic in the United States; 
· | The extent to which the purchase or products with our ingredients is a low priority item for a population whose disposable income may have decreased as a result of COVID-19 and the steps taken by the Chinese government to curb the spread of infection.

Government Regulations
 
In the event that we seek to market and sell our products in the United States, we will be subject to various laws and regulations. The United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a dietary ingredient as a vitamin, mineral, herb or other botanical, amino acid, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances. Unlike drugs, supplements are not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases, which means that supplements cannot make claims as to health benefits. Claims like these can only legitimately be made for drugs, not dietary supplements. Dietary supplements include such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes. Dietary supplements are marketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, powders, and liquids. Cordyceps is considered a dietary supplement.
 
The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates both finished dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients. The FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering “conventional” foods and drug products. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are prohibited from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. That means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act and FDA regulations. The FDA is responsible for taking action against any adulterated or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market.
 
The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. However, the reporting of an event is not an admission that the product caused the adverse event.
 
If we engage in business in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of other regulations, including those relating to health, safety, bioterrorism, environmental, cybersecurity, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and environmental. These regulations may require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure you we will able to be in compliance.

We do not presently sell products for retail sale to consumers although we may, to the extent that we implement our proposed business plan, develop products which are designed and packaged for consumer use. Our customers presently purchase our products in bulk and may use our products as ingredients in their products. Countries into which our products are sold have regulations relating to the marketing, labeling and claims for dietary supplements. Since we do not presently sell products in form for use by consumers, our customers must comply with applicable government regulations. Our present and recent former customers are located in Taiwan or Hong Kong, which have laws concerning the ingredients in products sold for consumption, including the purity of the ingredients. If products which include our products as ingredients are sold in Hong Kong or any other country, the products may be subject to the food and supplement regulations of the country. We do not make any of the products we sell. To the extent a claim arises either as a result of the use by a consumer of products which contain our ingredients or a government agency raises questions about the purity of ingredients purchased from us, we may incur liability for any adverse reactions to the products purchased by consumers or failures of our products to conform to the stated purity of our products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to claim over against our supplier. If we sell products that are designed and packaged for use by consumers, we may be subject to laws relating to such products, including the purity and labeling of the products and any other regulations that may be applicable.
 
If we sell products for consumer use in any country, we will be subject to the laws of that country. Each country has laws relating to products that are marketed as dietary supplements, including laws relating to the products and which describe the extent that products subject to the applicable laws, including the purity of the ingredients and marketing and labeling of products. We will need to comply with all applicable regulations and we may not be permitted to sell product in a country unless we have received prior approval from the applicable government agency. 
 
Research and Development
 
We plan to conduct research and development with respect to our own proprietary products. However, we have not yet commenced any such activity and we have not developed any detailed plan to engage in such activities, and we cannot assure you that we develop or implement any research and development program. Our research and development activities may relate to cordyceps products to be sold in the United States, although we do not presently have any plans to sell products at retail in the United States. We cannot assure you that we will commence research and development activities in the near future, if at all, or that we will be able to develop proprietary products. We do not presently have any employees engaged in research and develop, and, if we embark on a research and development program, we may engage third parties to perform the research and development, and the third parties may be related to our chief executive officer.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We do not have any patent or other intellectual property rights with respect to any products.
 
Competition
 
A number of companies market and sell cordyceps products in the United States, including Real Mushrooms, Bulk Supplements, Terrasoul SuperFoods; Mental Refreshment Nutrition, NOW Foods, Aloha Medicinals, Natures Elements and Swanson Premium. These products include cordyceps extract as well as products that include cordyceps along with other ingredients. Many, if not all, of these companies are better known and better capitalized than we are, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these and other existing suppliers of cordyceps.
Employees
 
We have one employee, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, Pao-Chi Chu, who works for us on a part-time basis.
