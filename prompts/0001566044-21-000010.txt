ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies in dermatology and beyond. Our products, AMZEEQ® (minocycline) topical foam, 4% (“AMZEEQ”) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in adults and patients 9 years of age and older, and ZILXI® (minocycline) topical foam, 1.5% (“ZILXI”) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults, are the first topical minocycline products to be approved by the FDA. AMZEEQ and ZILXI were commercially launched in January and October of 2020, respectively, and serve as a springboard for commercializing additional innovative products. Our product pipeline includes FCD105 (minocycline 3% and adapalene 0.3%) ("FCD105"), our proprietary novel topical combination foam formulation of minocycline and adapalene for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. FCD105 is a Phase 3-ready asset that we believe has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment for patients with acne. In addition, we recently announced a development program for FMX114, which is a combination topical gel for the potential treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. We plan to conduct a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study for FMX114 in the third quarter of 2021. 
AMZEEQ and ZILXI utilize our proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology (MST)™ delivery system that is also being used to develop FCD105. Our MST™ proprietary foam platform is designed to optimize the topical delivery of minocycline, an active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") that was previously available only in oral form despite its prevalent use in dermatology. In addition to the MST platform, we have a number of proprietary delivery platforms in development that enable topical delivery of other APIs, each having unique pharmacological features and characteristics designed to keep the API stable when delivered and directed to the target site. We believe our MST vehicles and other topical delivery platforms may offer significant advantages over alternative delivery options and are suitable for multiple application sites across a range of conditions. 
Our Strategy
In March 2020, we combined with Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Foamix"). Prior to the merger transaction, the Company’s strategy was focused on the development and commercialization of serlopitant for pruritic conditions. Following the receipt of the results of the Phase III PN Trials, we discontinued the development of serlopitant. Currently, our strategy is to develop and commercialize proprietary, innovative and differentiated therapies that we believe can advance the standard of care for patients with high unmet needs in dermatology. The key components of our strategy are to:
Commercialize AMZEEQ and ZILXI, and any of our other products which are approved for marketing. We are commercializing our AMZEEQ and ZILXI products in the United States by deploying a specialized, focused and scalable sales force targeting dermatologists and other healthcare practitioners. We believe that having this synergistic cross-brand commercial footprint allows us to effectively target key prescribers and leads to efficient sales activity. We are also actively pursuing opportunities to out-license our products and product candidates to third parties for development and commercialization outside the United States. For example, in April 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Cutia Therapeutics (HK) Limited, a company organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong (“Cutia”), pursuant to which we granted Cutia a license to obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize our minocycline products in Greater China in exchange for an upfront payment of $10 million and quarterly royalties on net sales. 
Develop our combination product candidate, FCD105. In June 2020, we announced positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the preliminary safety and efficacy of FCD105, the first ever topical minocycline-based combination product, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. We anticipate commencing a Phase 3 trial in 2021. If approved by the FDA, FCD105 will expand our product offering, which we believe will enhance our position as a scaled leader in dermatology.
Identify, in‑license and acquire new products and product candidates. In addition to developing product candidates organically within our organization, we intend to identify, evaluate, in‑license and acquire products and product candidates from third parties by leveraging our business development capabilities. With a goal of building a well‑balanced and diversified portfolio, we assess a variety of factors for potential product candidates and technologies. Our criteria for possible acquisition or in-licensing opportunities includes rationale for addressing the disease, likelihood of regulatory approval, commercial viability, intellectual property protection, prospects for favorable pricing and reimbursement and competition. We intend to continue to be opportunistic in our business development activities to achieve our long-term strategic goals. 
Advance early‑stage product candidates into late‑stage development, including FMX114. In developing early‑stage product candidates, such as FMX114, we focus on converting our understanding of disease states into proprietary, innovative, and differentiated therapies to address the unmet needs of patients. We seek to establish proof‑of‑concept and create intellectual property protection for these product candidates. Using this approach, our experienced management team is able to determine whether and how to advance product candidates into the next stages of development in a cost-effective manner, which we believe increases our ability to direct resources to promising programs and enhances our likelihood of successfully developing and commercializing our product candidates. In addition, we may also seek collaborations, licenses and other strategic relationships to assist in advancing and expanding our current and any future product candidates in order to drive value. 
Our Portfolio of Products and Product Candidates
The following provides a developmental summary of our products and key product candidates. The light blue represents the anticipated stage by year end 2021. 
AMZEEQ for moderate-to-severe acne
Overview
AMZEEQ (4% minocycline foam), formerly known as FMX101, was approved by the FDA in October 2019 and became available in pharmacies nationwide in January 2020. AMZEEQ is a once-daily novel topical antibiotic foam formulation of minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older. AMZEEQ utlizes our proprietary MST™ technology and is the first topical minocycline to be approved by the FDA for any condition. We believe that the combination of a well established antibiotic in a well-tolerated, easy to use foam makes AMZEEQ a very attractive treatment option for patients. 
Market opportunity
Acne is characterized by areas of scaly red skin, non-inflammatory blackheads and whiteheads, inflammatory lesions, papules and pustules and occasionally boils and scarring. It affects approximately 40 to 50 million people in the United States alone, of whom approximately 10 million suffer from moderate-to-severe acne. For most people, acne diminishes over time and tends to disappear or decrease by age 25. However, some individuals continue to suffer from acne well into their 30s, 40s and later.
The current U.S. market size for treatment of acne is considerable and estimated at approximately $5 billion and 22 million prescriptions in 2019, presenting significant unmet needs of patients and healthcare providers to be addressed. As the first topical minocycline to be approved by the FDA for any condition, we believe that AMZEEQ may provide a new treatment alternative for patients and healthcare providers who are unsatisfied with their current therapies.
Limitations of oral minocycline for acne
Oral minocycline, such as Solodyn, has been widely prescribed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. According to the product label of Solodyn, inflammatory lesions were reduced by 44% at week 12 following use, and a positive effect on the 
reduction of non-inflammatory acne lesions versus vehicle was not demonstrated. According to its product label, the most common adverse systemic side effects of Solodyn include diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, indigestion, lightheadedness, loss of appetite, nausea, sore mouth, throat or tongue and vomiting.
In 2009, the FDA added oral minocycline to its Adverse Event Reporting System, a list of medications under investigation by the FDA, due to its severe side effects. In 2011, we conducted a blind survey of 40 U.S. dermatologists. The results of the survey revealed that 90% of the dermatologists surveyed who prescribed oral minocycline were concerned about its side effects, and 76% of these dermatologists stated they would prefer prescribing a topical minocycline product over an existing oral medication, assuming the topical treatment was safe, effective and approved by the FDA.
ZILXI for papulopustular rosacea
Overview
ZILXI (1.5% minocycline foam), formerly known as FMX103, was approved by the FDA in May 2020 and became available in pharmacies nationwide in October 2020. ZILXI is a once-daily novel antibiotic foam formulation of minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Similar to AMZEEQ, ZILXI leverages our MST™ technology and is the first minocycline product of any form to be approved by the FDA for use in rosacea. We believe the anti-inflammatory properties of minocycline delivered in our innovative foam technology make ZILXI a highly appealing treatment option for rosacea patients. 
Market Opportunity
Papulopustular rosacea is a chronic skin disease causing inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) on the face. It can create psychosocial burdens, such as embarrassment, anxiety and low self-esteem that adversely affect quality of life. Rosacea is most frequently seen in adults between 30 and 60 years of age and affects more than 16 million people in the United States alone. There is no known cure for rosacea and the exact root cause of the disease remains unknown, though both genetic and environmental factors are thought to have an impact on its outbreak. Mild papulopustular rosacea is currently treated by topical antimicrobials (such as metronidazole, clindamycin and ivermectin) or azelaic acid, while the mainstays for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rosacea are systemic antibiotics such as minocycline and doxycycline.
The current U.S. market size for treatment of rosacea in adults is estimated to be approximately $1 billion and 4.4 million prescriptions, and we believe that ZILXI provides a new treatment alternative for patients and healthcare providers who are unsatisfied with their current therapies.
FCD105 for moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris
Overview
Our combination product candidate FCD105 (minocycline 3% and adapalene 0.3%) is our proprietary novel topical combination foam formulation of minocycline and adapalene minocycline for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. Based on the Phase 2 data, as further discussed below, we believe FCD105 has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment for patients with acne.
FCD105 foam combines the bacteriostatic and anti-inflammatory properties of minocycline with the third-generation retinoid, adapalene, which acts in regulating the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells. Oral minocycline and topical adapalene products are approved for use in the treatment of acne vulgaris in the United States, with the latter available in combination and as monotherapy. Pending a successful development program, we intend to file an NDA for FCD105 under the FDA 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which is the same regulatory pathway we have pursued for AMZEEQ and ZILXI.
Market opportunity
For information about the market opportunity for alternative treatments for acne vulgaris, please see “—AMZEEQ for moderate-to-severe acne—Market opportunity.” We believe that our FCD105 product candidate for this indication, if approved, may provide a new treatment alternative for patients and healthcare providers who are unsatisfied with their current therapies, alongside AMZEEQ and as a complementary product.
Limitations of oral minocycline for acne
For information about the limitations of oral minocycline for acne, please see “—AMZEEQ for moderate-to-severe acne—Limitations of oral minocycline for acne.”
FCD105 clinical trials
FCD105 Phase II clinical trial 
On September 19, 2019, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in our Phase II clinical trial (Study FX2016-40) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FCD105.
Study FX2016-40 is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 trial that enrolled 447 patients aged 12 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: FCD105 foam, 3% minocycline foam, 0.3% adapalene foam, or vehicle foam and self-applied their assigned treatment once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints were: (1) the proportion of patients achieving treatment success at week 12 based on an Investigator's Global Assessment (“IGA”) (success is defined as a score of 0 "clear" or 1 "minimal" and at least a two-grade improvement from baseline), (2) the mean change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at week 12, and (3) the mean change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12. Safety evaluations include reported adverse events, local skin tolerability assessments, physical examinations and vital signs.
On June 2, 2020, we announced positive results from this Phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of FCD105.
FCD105 showed a highly statistically significant improvement compared to vehicle for the endpoints of (1) IGA treatment success (IGA score “0” or “1” and at least a two-grade improvement from baseline) and (2) absolute change from baseline in mean inflammatory counts at week 12. The proportion of patients achieving IGA treatment success in the FCD105 treatment group was 35.9% compared to 15.7% of patients in the vehicle treatment group (p=0.0003). Absolute reduction in inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12 was -19.4 (-64.1%) for the FCD105 treatment group compared to -15.58 (-50.9%) for the vehicle treatment group (p=0.0020).
The trial was not powered to demonstrate a statistical difference between FCD105 and either 3% minocycline foam or 0.3% adapalene foam treatments; however, the majority of these comparisons did show a statistically significant improvement of FCD105 at week 12. Numerical improvement was observed for FCD105 on all efficacy endpoints for these comparisons at week 12.
Absolute reduction in non-inflammatory lesion counts at week 12 was also assessed with a mean lesion count reduction of -24.94 (-51.0%) for the FCD105 treatment group compared to -22.87 (-45.9%) for the vehicle treatment group. Although numerical improvement was shown, this was not statistically significant, which has been attributed to outlier results affecting both FCD105 and vehicle treatment groups. Conversely, absolute reduction in non-inflammatory lesion counts at week 12 for FCD105 did show a statistically significant improvement compared to each of 3% minocycline foam and 0.3% adapalene foam.
The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse event in the trial was upper respiratory tract infection (4.9% in the vehicle treatment group), with dry skin being the most commonly reported cutaneous adverse event (3.6% in the 0.3% adapalene treatment group). The majority of adverse events were assessed as mild in severity. There were no serious adverse events.
FCD105 was comparably tolerated to vehicle in all local skin tolerability assessments with 93% or greater of severity scores being assessed as “none” or “mild” for burning/stinging, itching, dryness, scaling, erythema and hyperpigmentation.
In November 2020, we conducted an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to confirm the key elements of the Phase III program to support a New Drug Application for FCD105. We anticipate initiating our Phase III program in 2021.
FMX114 for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis
In March 2021, we announced development plans for FMX114 for the potential treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. FMX114 is a fixed combination of tofacitinib, which is a pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, and fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. FMX114 attempts to address both the source and cause of inflammation in atopic dermatitis and support skin barrier recovery. FMX114, our first product candidate designed to target atopic dermatitis, will be evaluated in a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study expected to begin in the third quarter of 2021. 
Serlopitant for Pruritus
Prior to the Merger, the Company was focused on the development and commercialization of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus, or itch, associated with various conditions, such as prurigo nodularis and psoriasis. Serlopitant is a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of the neurokinin 1 receptor, or NK1-R, given as a once-daily, oral tablet. On April 6, 2020, we announced that our Phase III PN Trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of once daily oral serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis (study MTI-105 and study MTI-106) did not meet their respective primary endpoint of demonstrating statistically significant reduction in pruritus in patients treated with serlopitant compared to placebo based upon a 4-point improvement responder analysis. Following the receipt of such results, the Company has decided to discontinue the internal development of serlopitant.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of AMZEEQ, ZILXI or any of our product candidates. We currently contract with third party manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active ingredients and finished products for our preclinical research and clinical trials for our product candidates and for the supply of finished product for commercial use. We currently have no plans to establish our own manufacturing capabilities and plan to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for any future trials of our product candidates and commercialization of our products.
We, together with our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, have developed the validation processes, methods, tests and/or controls suitable for commercial scale manufacturing of our products and various product candidates and for defining their properties. Changes in manufacturing scale or the manufacturer may require changes to processes, methods, tests and/or controls, which may take time to develop, validate and implement.
On October 21, 2019, we entered into a Contract Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with ASM Aerosol-Service AG, or ASM, pursuant to which ASM agreed to exclusively manufacture and supply AMZEEQ and ZILXI for a specified price per can of product. Pursuant to the agreement, ASM has agreed to manufacture and supply all of our commercial needs for AMZEEQ and ZILXI on an exclusive basis for a period of four years, subject to certain exceptions. We are not required to purchase a minimum amount of the products under the ASM agreement. In addition, ASM will not be permitted to manufacture or supply to a third party any topical product containing minocycline or minocycline hydrochloride during the term of the ASM agreement and for two years after the termination or expiration of the ASM agreement. We also have supply agreements in place for the commercial supply of the drug substance minocycline hydrochloride, which is contained in our products and product candidates. We currently have a development contract and quality agreement in place with one CMO for the manufacturing of FCD105 for our clinical trials.
Development stage and commercial quantities of any products that we develop need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we seek approval. We require all of our CMOs to comply with these requirements and currently employ internal and external resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. The relevant manufacturers of our drug products for commercial production, and product candidates for our current preclinical and clinical trials, have advised us that they are compliant with both the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and cGMP.
Our products, AMZEEQ and ZILXI, and our product candidates, if approved, may not be able to be produced in sufficient commercial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements or at an acceptable cost. We and our contract manufacturers are, and will be, subject to extensive governmental regulation in connection with the manufacture of any pharmaceutical products or medical device constituent components. We and our contract manufacturers must ensure that all of the processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP and the FDA’s GLP for drugs on an ongoing basis, as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, and conduct extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers.
Commercialization
We have a scalable commercial infrastructure to support the sales of AMZEEQ, ZILXI and our product candidates, including FCD105, if approved, in the United States, and intend to partner with third parties outside the United States to launch our products in other geographic territories or therapeutic classes. See “—Development and License Agreements—Cutia License for Minocycline Products.” Our market strategy for AMZEEQ and ZILXI, physician targeting models, and portfolio strategies are designed to capitalize on infrastructure synergies. Our commercial sales force of approximately 50 representatives is responsible for selling both AMZEEQ and ZILXI and specifically targets dermatologists and other healthcare practitioners who diagnose and manage dermatologic conditions. We also have a centralized marketing, market access, supply chain and distribution infrastructure. 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, a significant percentage of our sales were to three national wholesale drug distributors. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we expanded our distribution capabilities with respect to AMZEEQ and ZILXI. In addition to distributing our products through national wholesalers, we have established direct relationships with certain independent and specialty pharmacies which account for a significant portion of volume in dermatology. We believe that dermatologists frequently rely on prescribing acne and rosacea products through independent and specialty pharmacies to ensure seamless access to the products they and their patients desire. As a result, we believe that these relationships will help further reduce the barriers for patients to initiate and maintain therapy with our products. 
Additionally, continuous efforts are deployed to identify unmet needs in the dermatology market, assess their commercial potential and advise on the prioritization of the development of our future product candidates accordingly.
Development and License Agreements
Parallel to the development of our product candidates, we have entered into development and license agreements with various pharmaceutical companies. Certain licenses combine our emulsion-based foam technology with drugs selected by the licensee to create new product offerings for patients. Each license agreement entitles us to service payments, contingent payments and royalties from sales of any new products that are commercialized. Each agreement is exclusive only to the specific drug that is licensed, leaving us the rights to commercialize and develop products with other drugs for the same indications using our 
proprietary foam technology while also allowing the licensee to apply the new products to any indication with its specific drug. A summary of our material license agreements is set forth below. 
Cutia License for Minocycline Products
On April 21, 2020, we entered into a License Agreement with Cutia (the “Cutia License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Cutia License Agreement, we granted Cutia an exclusive license to obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize AMZEEQ and ZILXI in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (each a “Region” and collectively, the “Territory”). In addition, Cutia has been granted an exclusive license to obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize FCD105 (together with AMZEEQ and ZILXI, the “Licensed Products”) in the Territory if and as approved by the FDA in the United States. We have agreed to supply the finished Licensed Products to Cutia for clinical and commercial use at an agreed price.
We received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million pursuant to the Cutia License Agreement. We will be entitled to receive an additional $1.0 million following the first regulatory approval of any of the Licensed Products by the National Medical Product Administration of the People’s Republic of China. In addition, we will be entitled to receive a royalty on net sales of the Licensed Products in the Territory each quarter. The royalties will be payable on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and Region-by-Region basis and will be paid until the later of (i) ten years from the date of first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such Region and (ii) the expiration of the last claim of our patent covering such Licensed Product in such Region.
We may terminate the Cutia License Agreement if, among other things, Cutia challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any of our licensed patents in respect of the Licensed Products in a litigation or other court proceeding, subject to certain exceptions. Cutia may terminate the Cutia License Agreement at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice. In addition, Cutia may terminate the Cutia License Agreement if a regulatory authority in the Territory has ordered Cutia to stop all sales of Licensed Products in the Territory due to a safety concern, subject to certain exceptions. The Cutia License Agreement also contains representations and warranties customary for this type of agreement, including with respect to intellectual property rights.
LEO Pharma A/S for Finacea Foam
In September 2015, Bayer HealthCare AG, or Bayer, began selling in the United States a product branded Finacea, based on our foam technology. Finacea is a prescription topical drug which was developed through a collaboration between Bayer and Foamix. It is the first prescription product developed using our proprietary technology that has been approved by the FDA for sale in the United States. Bayer listed in the Orange Book several patents that were licensed from us in connection with the development of Finacea. According to our initial license agreement with Bayer, we are entitled to receive royalties and certain contingent payments upon the commercialization of Finacea. On September 4, 2018, LEO Pharma A/S ("Leo") acquired Finacea from Bayer. As part of the acquisition, our license agreement with Bayer with respect to Finacea was assigned to LEO. LEO has assumed all of the rights and responsibilities of Bayer under the license agreement as it relates to Finacea, including the payment of royalties to us and rights and obligations related to patent litigation matters.
In April 2019, LEO informed us that the batches of API intended for use in Finacea and produced by a contract manufacturer had failed to meet the required specifications for the finished product. As a result, LEO was unable to manufacture the Finacea product for sale, which, in turn, stopped the royalty payments from LEO to us during the time of the supply interruption. In April 2020, LEO remedied the supply issues and resumed commercial sales in the United States. This supply chain issue for Finacea was unrelated to our manufacturing, production or supply of AMZEEQ, ZILXI, FCD105 or any of our other product candidates. In 2020, we received (or became entitled to receive) a total of $0.8 million in royalties from sales of Finacea from LEO.
Together with LEO, we resolved litigation against Taro, Teva and Perrigo for their alleged infringement of certain of our patents following their submission of an ANDA to the FDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of Finacea. This settlement concludes the litigation relating to Finacea. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We have received notice letters of ANDAs submitted for drug products that are generic versions of Finacea foam and we have been involved in lawsuits to protect and enforce our patents, and while we have now settled all these lawsuits we may in the future be involved in other lawsuits to protect and enforce our patents, for example, if we receive new notice letters of submission of an ANDA to the FDA seeking approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of a product with Orange Book listed patents.”
Merck License for Serlopitant
In December 2012, Menlo entered into a license agreement with Merck for exclusive worldwide royalty free rights for the development and commercialization of serlopitant and two other NK1 R antagonists in all human diseases, disorders or conditions, except for in the field of treatment or prevention of nausea or vomiting, which was retained by Merck. We paid Merck an upfront licensing fee of $1.0 million and issued to Merck an aggregate of 1,243,168 shares of our common stock. In addition, we have agreed to make aggregate payments of up to $25.0 million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for serlopitant. Furthermore, if we choose to pursue the development of any other non-serlopitant product pursuant to this agreement, we may owe up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of additional payments upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. In 2018, upon dosing our first patient in our Phase 3 clinical trial for serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus associated with PN, we paid a milestone payment of $3.0 million to Merck. We are responsible for the prosecution and enforcement of patents licensed under the agreement. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities, and terminates on the date of achievement of all of milestones set forth in the agreement, after which our licenses become fully paid and perpetual. Each party may also terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events, and we may terminate the agreement without cause at any time upon advance written notice to Merck.
The Company has decided to discontinue the internal development of serlopitant following the receipt of the results of the Phase III PN Trials in April 2020. 
Additional Research and Development
In addition to AMZEEQ for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older, ZILXI for the treatment of rosacea in adults, FCD105 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris and licensed products resulting from our development and license agreements with various pharmaceutical companies, we are developing product candidates for various indications to which we own worldwide rights, and which are based on formulations and adaptations of our patented, versatile foam platforms or other dosage forms and/or new technology.
We intend to selectively proceed into clinical trials with these formulations under the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway wherever necessary to expedite FDA approval, and according to our identification of unmet needs and potential market opportunities.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our research and development expenses totaled $43.5 million. Prior to the Merger, our research and development expenses totaled $51.2 million and $64.5 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties such as contract research organizations, or CROs, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical trials and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These CROs and other third parties provide us with project management, monitoring, regulatory consulting and investigative services, and their fees are part of our research and development expenses.
Intellectual Property – our Products and Pipeline Clinical Trial Product Candidates 
Our intellectual property and proprietary technology are essential to the development, manufacture and sale of our topical AMZEEQ and ZILXI foam products, our phase III ready FCD105 combination product and our clinical stage future pipeline product candidates. We are committed to protecting our intellectual property rights, core technologies and other know-how, through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, copyrights, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, common interest agreements to protect privileged confidential information, licenses, assignments of invention and other contractual arrangements with our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, partners, suppliers, customers and others. Such agreements and rights may however be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, partners or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions. Additionally, we rely on our research and development program, clinical trials, know-how and marketing and distribution programs to advance our products. Our commercial success may depend on our ability to defend and assert our intellectual property and other rights, which is uncertain.
Our commercial success will also depend at least in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our current and future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or other proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, 
or USPTO, to determine priority of invention. We may also have to participate in court proceedings or arbitration to defend and assert our rights.
 As of December 31, 2020, the combined portfolio of the merged company had a patent portfolio of over 215 granted patents in certain countries worldwide, including over 90 granted patents in the United States. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we had a number of pending patent applications worldwide, of which over 25 are pending in the United States. Our portfolio also includes a significant number of issued patents from licenses. The portfolio describes and claims topical delivery platforms, including various foam-based platforms, and other technology such as patents and applications in relation to serlopitant, its uses and compositions for oral delivery. Our main foam-based platform, which is the subject of various patents and pending patent applications, relates to our minocycline foam products, and utilizes our proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology (MST)™ platform. We also have granted patents in the United States for our various other foam platforms, such as emulsion foam, hydrophobic foam, hydro-alcoholic foam, and aqueous foam and we have additional patents directed to other technology.
AMZEEQ and ZILXI
Our most important issued patents are various U.S. patents relating to our AMZEEQ and ZILXI foam products, and to our Phase III-ready topical combination foam candidate FCD105. We have a number of issued U.S. patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book in relation to ZILXI and AMZEEQ. Subject to payments of the appropriate maintenance fees, the patents related to ZILXI expire in 2030 and the patents related to AMZEEQ expire in 2030 and 2037. These patents generally relate to a composition of matter comprising a claim to a minocycline formulation or to a formulation of a tetracycline antibiotic, which can include minocycline or doxycycline, or to methods of treatment using the compositions and therefore, may be less protective than patents that claim a new drug. We also have granted patents and pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions with specifications relating to AMZEEQ, ZILXI, or FCD105.
AMZEEQ, ZILXI and FCD105 are based on a different foam technology platform and are supported by different patents and applications than those patents listed in the Orange Book for the foam technology used in Finacea foam.
Serlopitant
We have discontinued the internal development of serlopitant. We currently own and have licensed various granted patents related to serlopitant in the United States. We have a granted patent licensed from Merck with claims in relation to the compound serlopitant and to a composition of matter comprising serlopitant that is expected to expire in 2025 in the United States, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid. Patent applications in the same family were also filed internationally and patents have been granted in multiple foreign jurisdictions. We additionally have granted patents in the United States claiming methods-of-use for serlopitant that are expected to expire in 2033 in the United States, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid. From this family we also have patents granted in several foreign jurisdictions and patent applications pending in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions.
An additional patent term of up to five years may potentially be awarded in the United States for one of the serlopitant U.S. patents as a result of the patent term extension provision of the Hatch Waxman Act, if regulatory approval of serlopitant is obtained. Further, depending on national laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, an extension of patent term may also potentially be available if regulatory approval of serlopitant is obtained in those countries. For example, a supplementary protection certificate, if obtained in Europe, can provide up to a maximum five years of market exclusivity. Likewise, in Japan, the term of a patent may be extended by a maximum of five years in certain circumstances.
Competition
The medical and pharmaceutical industries in which we operate are intensely competitive and subject to significant technological change and changes in practice. While we believe that our innovative technology, knowledge, experience and resources provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from many different sources with respect to AMZEEQ and ZILXI and our other pipeline products or any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Possible competitors may include pharmaceutical companies, academic and medical institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. These prospective competitors have the ability to effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products that compete with ours, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff.
Currently marketed products that could compete with AMZEEQ include: (i) oral products such as Solodyn (minocycline, Bausch Health), Minocin (minocycline, Bausch Health), Ximino (minocycline extended release, Journey Medical Corporation), Doryx (doxycycline, Mayne Pharmaceuticals), Targadox (doxycycline, Journey), Acticlate (docycycline, Almirall), Claravis (isotretinoin, Teva Pharmaceuticals), Myorisan (isotretinoin, Douglas Pharmaceuticals) and Seysara (sarecycline, Almirall) and (ii) topical products such as Epiduo (adapalene + BPO, Galderma), Aczone (dapsone, Almirall), Retin-A (tretinoin, Bausch Health), Onexton-Acanya (clindamycin + BPO, Bausch Health), Benzaclin (benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin, Bausch Health), Arazlo (tazarotene, Bausch Health), Tazorac (tazarotene, Almirall), Altreno (tretinoin, Ortho Derm), Aklief (trifarotene, Galderma), Fabior (tazarotene, Mayne Pharmaceuticals), Ziana (clindamycin + tretinoin, Medicis Pharmaceutical), Differin (adapalene, Galderma) and Winlevi (clascoterone, Cassiopea SpA). 
Currently marketed products that may compete with ZILXI include: (i) branded and generic oral products containing minocycline and Oracea (doxycycline, Galderma) and (ii) topical products such as all forms of metrogel/metronidazole available as a branded or generic product, Soolantra (ivermectin, Galderma) and Finacea (azaleic acid, LEO). Other topical products that may also compete include Mirvaso (brimonidine, Galderma Laboratories ) and Rhofade (oxymetazoline, Epi Health), which are used to reduce redness.
In addition, new products are currently being developed that may compete with AMZEEQ and ZILXI, including, generic versions of any of the above on-marketed products. In September 2019, Hovione Farmaciencia SA, a private company, announced details of its planned Minocycline Against Rosacea Study, Phase 3 development program for the treatment of moderate-to-severe inflammatory rosacea with HY01, a 3% topical gel suspension containing minocycline non-hydrochloride. In January 2020, BioPharmX Corporation entered into a Merger Agreement with Timber Pharmaceuticals LLC and intends to “evaluate BioPharmX's Phase 3 ready proprietary topical minocycline gel programs.” This product has previously been studied by BioPharmX in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris and papulopustular rosacea. Glenmark is developing a minocycline gel and is working on a minocycline combination product. In addition, PDUFA dates for Sol-Gel’s EPSOLAY (microencapsulated benzoyl peroxide cream, 5%) for inflammatory lesions of rosacea, and for TWYNEO (microencapsulated benzoyl peroxide, 3% and microencapsulated tretinoin, 0.1%) for acne vulgaris have been set for 2021. Sol-Gel is also working on a minocycline composition. If ultimately approved and launched in the United States, these product candidates, and others that may be in development, could be direct competitors to AMZEEQ and ZILXI.
Licenses have been granted for certain topical products with various licensees combining our proprietary technology with a drug selected by the licensee. The development of these products is uncertain. They may have been delayed or adversely affected following the advent of the COVID crisis and some or all may not continue. While the licenses we grant are exclusive with respect to the specific drug which is licensed, our agreements with these licensees allow them to commercialize the licensed developed products for any topical dermatological application, not just for the specific indication for which each product was originally intended. If any such licensed product proves to be effective for moderate-to severe acne, rosacea or any other indication that we are pursuing with AMZEEQ, ZILXI, FCD105 or our other product candidates, we may face competition from these licensees. Although these products would be based on a different foam technology than the technology platforms used in our in-house minocycline-based products, such licensed products may nevertheless pose a competitive challenge, as they will have the benefit of our foam technology coupled with the licensees’ potentially greater resources, experience and brand recognition, extensive marketing channels and other capabilities, and possibly the advantage of entering the market before us.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive government regulation. Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of our foam delivered treatments and in our ongoing research and development activities.
Product approval process in the United States
Review and approval of drugs
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA and implementing regulations. In general, new drug products require the submission of a NDA and approval thereof by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions and enforcement actions brought by the FDA, the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. Possible sanctions may include the FDA’s refusal to 
approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA prior to marketing and distributing a new drug product in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated at that site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a NDA or supplemental NDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product or components thereof are produced, to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Good Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites and the sponsor’s clinical trial records to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•payment of user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
Preclinical studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced.
Clinical trials in support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials 
must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which, in some cases, may overlap or be combined:
•Phase I: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
•Phase II: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase III: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Submission of a NDA to the FDA
The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture, control and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, applicants are required to pay fees to the FDA for reviewing an NDA. These user fees, as well as the annual fees required for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. Each NDA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following submission of the application. If found complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thus triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most NDAs for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
Before approving a NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured or facilities that are significantly involved in the product development and distribution process, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory at such facilities. The FDA may deny approval of a NDA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional testing or information, which can delay the approval process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or may never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval will specify the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed in the United States pursuant to that NDA, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies or trials be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies ("REMS"), or may impose other limitations. After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including any advisory committee recommendation, if applicable, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or non-clinical testing in a resubmission to the NDA in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. FDA has committed to reviewing such submissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included in the resubmission. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, 
be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product.
Once a product is approved, marketing the product for other indicated uses or making certain manufacturing or other changes requires FDA review and approval of a supplemental NDA or a new NDA, which may require additional clinical data and review fees. In addition, further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product may be required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur at any time following approval. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. Fast track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted.
In addition, a sponsor can request breakthrough therapy designation for a drug if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance from FDA on an efficient drug development program, organizational commitment to the development and review of the product including involvement of senior managers, and, like fast track products, are also eligible for rolling review of the NDA. Both fast track and breakthrough therapy products are also eligible for accelerated approval and/or priority review, if relevant criteria are met.
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
Once a NDA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, for NDAs for new molecular entities, these six- and ten- month review periods are measured from the 60-day filing date rather than the receipt date, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to request and potentially receive a priority review. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In 
addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on responding to requests for expanded access. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of applications that may be submitted to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act created two additional marketing pathways under Sections 505(j) and 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for generic versions of approved drug products through the submission of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the branded reference drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the branded reference drug. ANDA applicants are required to conduct bioequivalence testing to confirm chemical and therapeutic equivalence to the branded reference drug. Generic versions of drugs can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the branded reference drug.
In addition, an applicant may submit a NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of a NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from FDA’s conclusions of safety or efficacy from studies or trials not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not received a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved reference, or “listed” drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
The Orange Book
In seeking approval for a drug through a NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug in accordance with state law.
To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) application with respect to any patents for the previously approved product on which the applicant’s application relies that are listed in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that, in relevant part, (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, and additional 6 months pediatric exclusivity 
if applicable, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired. If a generic drug product is ready for approval before the expiration of any patents or exclusivities accorded to the reference listed drug product, the FDA issues a tentative approval letter to the applicant. The tentative approval letter details the circumstances associated with the tentative approval. The FDA delays final approval of the generic drug product until all patent or exclusivity issues have been resolved. A tentative approval does not allow the applicant to market the generic drug product.
If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest to occur of 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay.
Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted after the fourth year of a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation.
Marketing Exclusivity
In addition to patent protections applicable to a listed drug, a Section 505(b)(1) application and a 505(b)(2) application may be subject to periods of statutory market exclusivity afforded to an approved new drug. Statutory market exclusivity provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug product, and precludes approval of certain 505(b)(2) and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) referencing the approved drug product for prescribed periods of time. Exclusivity is available for new chemical entities, as well as for significant changes in already approved drug products, such as a new indication or new use. FDA may refuse to approve a Section 505(b)(2) or ANDA application that is referencing a previously approved drug product to the extent that the drug product is subject to market exclusivity. Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved either alone or in combination by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity and during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug, except that such applications may be submitted after 4 years if they contain a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement. Certain approvals granted for change(s) to a drug resulting from new clinical studies that were “essential to approval,” such as a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, dosing regimen or indication, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity. During this three-year exclusivity, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change(s). Drugs based on an “old antibiotic,” such as AMZEEQ and ZILXI, and our FCD105 product candidate which contain minocycline, must also demonstrate “a significant new use” such as a new indication for a previously approved antibiotic, and not just refinements in labeling related to previously approved uses, in order to qualify for the three-year exclusivity. A claim of market exclusivity of three years was requested in the original NDA for AMZEEQ, but we do not know if or when it may be granted. In addition, while we have not yet received an exclusivity determination for ZILXI, we do expect to be granted three years of marketing exclusivity as it is the first minocycline approved for rosacea. 
Post-approval requirements
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. Certain requirements include, inter alia, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information on an annual basis or more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” and other promotional activities, such as those considered to be false or misleading. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including the immediate discontinuation of noncomplying materials, adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective 
advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Such enforcement may also lead to scrutiny and enforcement by other government and regulatory bodies.
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not encourage, market or promote such off-label uses. As a result, “off-label promotion” has formed the basis for litigation under the Federal False Claims Act, or FCA, violations of which are subject to significant civil fines and penalties. In addition, under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, manufacturers of certain prescription products are required to disclose annually to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, or CMS payments or transfers of value made to “covered recipients” and teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interests held by covered recipients and their immediate family members. Reportable payments and transfers of value may be direct or indirect, in cash or kind, for any reason, and are required to be disclosed even if the transfers are not related to an approved product. Failure to comply with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act could result in penalties up to $1.15 million per year.
The manufacturing of any of our products will be required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. The FDA’s cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain states. These entities are further subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions or other consequences for a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, as well as lead to potential market disruptions. These restrictions or consequences may include untitled or warning letters, recalls, suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, and continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a “consent decree,” which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, or Phase IV testing, as well as REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of our products.
Pediatric trials and exclusivity
Even when not pursuing a pediatric indication, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trials the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the FDASIA.
Separately, in the event the FDA makes a written request for pediatric data relating to a drug product, an NDA sponsor who submits such data may be entitled to pediatric exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional 6 months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity.
Patent term restoration and extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, generally referred to as the “Hatch-Waxman Act,” which permits an extension of the term 
of a patent for up to five years to compensate patent holders for marketing time lost while developing the product and awaiting government approval during the FDA regulatory review. The basis for the patent extension is the regulatory review period, which is basically composed of two parts, a testing phase and an approval phase, less a reduction, if any, in either part for a period time where there was a finding of lack of due diligence. The restoration period granted can be up to one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA (testing phase), plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date (approval phase). Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. In other words, the total maximum patent life for the product with the patent extension cannot exceed 14 years from the products approval date, which amounts to 14 years of potential marketing time. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question and within 60 days of FDA approval. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals and the scope of the extended patent is limited to the approved drug. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. The term of a patent which claims a human drug product, a method of using the product, or a method of manufacturing the product may potentially be extended if it satisfies the various conditions including that it is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the drug. The patents for serlopitant and its use are potentially eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, if serlopitant is approved by the FDA, because serlopitant has never been approved by the FDA. The patents supporting AMZEEQ and ZILXI were not eligible for the said patent term extension, since minocycline the active pharmaceutical ingredient of AMZEEQ and ZILXI was already approved for marketing by the FDA. The same reasoning will also apply to our FCD105 product candidate and to other pipeline product candidates where the active pharmaceutical ingredients were previously approved for marketing by the FDA.
Review and approval of drug products outside the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can be subject to uncertainties, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Regulation in the European Economic Area
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs:
•The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
Prior to obtaining an MA in the EEA, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the EEA regulatory agency, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EEA regulatory agency has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
In the EEA, upon receiving a MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EEA from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EEA regulatory agencies to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product and any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and other markets, sales of any product, and any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication.
Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. A payor may not consider a product to be medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved, or that other payors will similarly provide similar coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. We have evaluated the optimal price range for AMZEEQ and ZILXI that will reflect their benefits relative to alternative treatments while remaining affordable to potential customers and reimbursable by governments and third-party payors. Our pricing and overall access strategy prioritizes patients and their healthcare providers by providing novel medicines at pricing designed to help provide the broadest possible access to products for patients. We believe that the agreements we have entered into with pharmacy benefit managers provide broad commercial coverage for AMZEEQ and ZILXI, however we cannot be certain that these levels of coverage will continue to increase, or that we will be able to maintain these levels of coverage.
CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers pay quarterly rebates to each state Medicaid agency. Generally, for branded prescription drugs marketed under NDAs, as AMZEEQ, ZILXI and our other product candidates are expected to be, manufacturers are required to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between such price and the best price during a specified period. An additional rebate for products marketed under NDAs is payable if the average manufacturer price increases at a rate higher than inflation, and other methodologies apply to new formulations of existing drugs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act (the "ACA") revised certain definitions used for purposes of calculating the rebates, including the definition of “average manufacturer price.” Various state Medicaid programs have implemented voluntary supplemental drug rebate programs that may provide states with additional manufacturer rebates in exchange for preferred status on a state’s formulary or for patient populations that are not included in the traditional Medicaid drug benefit coverage.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies or trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, and particularly on prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
Healthcare laws and regulations
In March 2010, the then President of the United States signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. This comprehensive legislative overhaul was expected to extend coverage to approximately 36 million previously uninsured Americans. However, the individual mandate was recently repealed by Congress in The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, tax reform bill that was signed into law in December 2017 and became effective January 1, 2019. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage by 2027 and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the lower court decision, which was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal on an expedited basis and the Court heard oral arguments on the matter on November 10, 2020. A decision is expected to be forthcoming during the current U.S. Supreme Court term in 2021. On February 10, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice Filed a letter with the U.S. Supreme Court stating that, following the change in the U.S. presidential administration, the United States no longer adheres to the conclusions in its previous briefs in support of invalidating the ACA. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
The ACA requires the pharmaceutical industry to share in the costs of reform by increasing Medicaid rebates and expanding Medicaid rebates to cover Medicaid managed care programs, among other things. The ACA also includes funding of pharmaceutical costs for Medicare patients in excess of the prescription drug coverage limit and below the catastrophic coverage threshold. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close this gap, also known as the “donut hole”. Additionally, an excise tax was levied against certain branded pharmaceutical products. The Administration is expected to evaluate drug pricing and the Medicare parts B and D programs in terms of legislative or policy changes in the current session of Congress.
Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with healthcare providers, third party payors and other customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
•the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, under the ACA, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil FCA. Additionally, many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors. Violations of the federal or state anti-kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal and state health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties. The previous U.S. presidential administration issued final rules in late 2020 that, among other things, made changes to certain Anti-Kickback safe harbors; however, these rule may be affected by a regulatory freeze announced by the current administration in January 2021;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Even where pharmaceutical companies do not submit claims directly to payors, they can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, marketing products of sub-standard quality, or paying a kickback that results in a claim for items or services. In addition, activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for pharmaceutical products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for such products, and the sale 
and marketing of such products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Private individuals or whistleblowers can bring FCA “qui tam” actions on behalf of the government and may share in amounts recovered. Proof of intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including any third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or making false statements relating to healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to individually identifiable health information including PHI, upon “covered entities” subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that perform services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, including PHI. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Other federal and state laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, also impose requirements with respect to individuals' personal information;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs, devices and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, Section 6004 of the ACA requires annual reporting of information about drug samples that manufacturers and authorized distributors provide to physicians; and
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply more broadly than their U.S. federal analogues, such as to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require drug companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state and local laws that require the licensure of sales representatives; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to drug pricing or payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018); state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other healthcare regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or consent decree, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and pursue our strategy.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions, primarily Israel, governing, among other things, (i) the use, storage, registration, handling, emission and disposal of chemicals, waste materials and sewage; and (ii) chemical, air, water and ground contamination, air emissions and the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals, waste materials and sewage. Our operations at our Rehovot research and development facility use chemicals and produce waste materials and 
sewage. Our activities require permits from various governmental authorities including, local municipal authorities, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Health, local authorities and the municipal water and sewage company conduct periodic inspections in order to review and ensure our compliance with the various regulations.
These laws, regulations and permits could potentially require the expenditure by us of significant amounts for compliance or remediation. If we fail to comply with such laws, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines and other civil, administrative or criminal sanctions, including the revocation of permits and licenses necessary to continue our business activities. In addition, we may be required to pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third party claims, including those relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous substances we use, store, handle, transport, manufacture or dispose of), property damage or contribution claims. Some environmental, health and safety laws allow for strict, joint and several liability for remediation costs, regardless of comparative fault. We may be identified as a responsible party under such laws. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters are often subject to change. In the event of any changes or new laws or regulations, we could be subject to new compliance measures or to penalties for activities which were previously permitted. For instance, Israeli regulations were promulgated in 2011 relating to the discharge of industrial sewage into the sewer system. These regulations establish new and potentially significant fees for discharging forbidden or irregular sewage into the sewage system.
The operations of our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to various Israeli and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters, and their failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, result in an interruption or delay in the manufacture of AMZEEQ, ZILXI or the development or manufacture of our product candidates, or increase the costs for the manufacture of AMZEEQ, ZILXI or for the development or manufacture of our product candidates.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 106 employees comprised of 55 females and 51 males, all of whom are full-time employees. As of such date, 48 employees were sales representatives and 15 employees were primarily engaged in research and development activities. We believe our sales force is sufficient to effectively target dermatologists and other healthcare providers nationwide in order to successfully commercialize our products. In addition, we believe our internal R&D capabilities coupled with our third-party R&D consultants are well positioned to execute our pipeline strategy in a cost effective manner. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. We value the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees and we believe we offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages in the U.S. and Israel. 
We strive to foster a corporate culture built on communication and transparency. We hold annual company-wide trainings and host regularly scheduled town halls where management communicates notable corporate developments to Company employees. We are also focused on understanding our diversity and inclusion strengths and opportunities and executing on a strategy to support further progress. We will continue to promote a work environment that is based on the fundamental principles of human dignity, equality and mutual respect. 
In addition, we are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we invested in personal protective equipment for our sales representatives so as to enhance their safety and protect individuals they interact with in the field. We will continue to support our sales force during these unprecedented circumstances to ensure their safety and well being. 
Financial and Segment Information
