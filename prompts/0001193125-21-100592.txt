ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a blank check company recently incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. Our sponsor is an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (together with its affiliates, Cerberus). 
 Our sponsor was founded by Stephen A. Feinberg, Frank W. Bruno, and certain senior executives of Cerberus. Stephen A. Feinberg founded Cerberus in 1992 and is currently its Co-Chief Executive Officer. Frank W. Bruno is Co-Chief Executive Officer of Cerberus and has worked with Mr. Feinberg for over 22 years. Mr. Bruno also serves as the Chairman of our board of directors. Under their leadership, Cerberus has become a global leader in alternative investing with approximately $53 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2020 and expertise in private equity, credit and real estate. Over the course of its history, Cerberus has developed a group of senior information and communications technology (ICT) executives and investors with a proven track record of leading, investing in and growing large, scaled enterprises. 
 On September 10, 2020, our sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share, to cover certain expenses on our behalf in consideration of 11,500,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001. In October 2020, our sponsor surrendered 4,312,500 of our Class B ordinary shares, which decreased the number of outstanding founder shares from 11,500,000 to 7,187,500 and on December 7, 2020, as a result of the remaining over-allotment option expiring unexercised, 708,275 Class B ordinary shares were forfeited resulting in 6,479,225 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding. 
 On October 26, 2020, the company consummated its initial public offering of 25,000,000 units, generating gross proceeds of $250 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $14.5 million, inclusive of approximately $8.8 million in deferred underwriting commissions. On November 10, 2020, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional 916,900 units, generating gross proceeds of approximately $9.2 million, and incurred additional offering costs of approximately $0.5 million in underwriting fees (inclusive of approximately $0.3 million in deferred underwriting fees). 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company consummated the private placement of 800,000 private placement units at a price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating total gross proceeds of $8.0 million. On November 10, 2020, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 18,338 private placement units to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $183,380. 
 On March 12, 2021, the company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) by and among the company, King Pubco, Inc. (Pubco), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the sponsor, an affiliate of the company, King Corp Merger Sub, Inc. (Corp Merger Sub), a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the sponsor, King LLC Merger Sub, LLC (LLC Merger Sub), a Delaware limited liability company and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco, and Maple Holdings Inc. (KORE), a Delaware corporation. 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto plan to enter into a business combination transaction (the Proposed Transaction) pursuant to which, among other things, (i) on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the company will merge with and into LLC Merger Sub, a subsidiary of Pubco (the Pubco Merger), with LLC Merger Sub being the surviving entity of the Pubco Merger and Pubco as parent of the surviving entity, (ii) on the Closing Date and immediately prior to the First Merger (as 
 
2 


  defined below), Sponsor will contribute 100% of its equity interests in Corp Merger Sub to Pubco (the Corp Merger Sub Contribution), as a result of which Corp Merger Sub will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco, (iii) following the Corp Merger Sub Contribution, Corp Merger Sub will merge with and into KORE (the First Merger), with KORE being the surviving corporation of the First Merger; and (iv) immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, KORE will merge with and into LLC Merger Sub (the Second Merger and, together with the First Merger, being collectively referred to as the Mergers and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Transactions and the closing of the Transactions, the Closing), with LLC Merger Sub being the surviving entity of the Second Merger and Pubco being the sole member of LLC Merger Sub. 
 As a result of the First Merger, among other things, all shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants and options of KORE, in each case, outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger, will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a portion of the Closing Cash Consideration and/or the Closing Share Consideration. The Closing Cash Consideration will be comprised of (i) the aggregate amount of cash payable in respect of KOREs Series A, A-1 and Series B preferred stock pursuant to the governing documents of KORE (which amount will be determined as of the Closing Date and will not exceed $268,345,812, assuming the Closing occurs prior to the termination date of the Merger Agreement), (ii) $4,075,000 payable to certain holders of KOREs stock options and (iii) $1,050,000 payable to certain employees of KORE pursuant to the KORE Wireless Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan. The Closing Share Consideration will be comprised of $346,000,000 in shares of common stock of Pubco, at $10.00 per share, par value $0.0001 per share, with 432,500 of such shares of common stock being payable to certain holders of KOREs stock options, and the balance being payable to holders of KOREs common stock, Series C preferred stock and warrants. 
 Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions of the respective parties, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, receipt of approval from shareholders of each of the company and KORE for consummation of the Proposed Transaction and certain other actions related thereto by our shareholders. 
 The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing (i) by mutual written consent of the comapny and KORE, (ii) by either the company or KORE (a) if the Transactions are not consummated on or before September 12, 2021, (b) if a governmental entity shall have issued an order or taken any other action that is final and nonappealable and permanently enjoins or prohibits the Pubco Merger or the Mergers, (c) in the event of certain uncured breaches by the other party, (iii) by the company or KORE if, at the special meeting for the companys shareholders, the Transactions and related matters fail to be approved by requisite holders of the companys outstanding shares, (iv) by the company, if KORE does not deliver certain stockholder approvals required under the Merger Agreement within 48 hours after the company registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the business combination is declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or (v) by the company, if KOREs PCAOB-compliant audited financial statements for 2019 and 2020 (x) have not been delivered to the company within 15 business days following the date of the Merger Agreement, (y) are not accompanied by an unqualified opinion from KOREs auditor and/or (z) with respect to KORE and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, differ in any material and adverse respect from the unaudited 2019 and 2020 financial statements previously delivered to the company. 
 In connection with the proposed business combination with KORE, the company has entered and plans to enter into certain related agreements, including the below. 
 Investor Rights Agreement 
 The Merger Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, Pubco, the Sponsor, certain stockholders of KORE and the other parties thereto will enter into an Investor Rights Agreement, (the Investor Rights Agreement) setting forth the parties rights and obligations with respect to the designation, removal and 
 
3 


  replacement of directors of Pubco and the registration for resale of certain shares of Pubco Common Stock and other equity securities of Pubco that are held by the parties thereto from time to time. 
 Subscription Agreements 
 On March 12, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the company entered into subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements) with certain investors (collectively, the PIPE Investors), pursuant to, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for 22,500,000 shares of Pubco Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 (the PIPE Investment). The PIPE Investment will be consummated substantially concurrently with the Closing. 
 The Subscription Agreements for the PIPE Investors provide for certain registration rights. In particular, the company is required to, as soon as practicable but no later than 15 calendar days following the Closing, submit to or file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of such shares. Additionally, the company is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof. Upon the reasonable request of a PIPE Investor, the company must use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement continuously effective with respect to such PIPE Investor until the earliest of: (a) the date such PIPE Investor no longer holds any registrable shares, (b) the date all registrable shares held by such PIPE Investor may be sold without restriction under Rule 144 and (c) two years from the date of effectiveness of the registration statement. 
 The Subscription Agreements will terminate with no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of: (i) three business days after the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) the mutual written agreement of the parties to such Subscription Agreement, or (iii) the failure to close by December 12, 2021. 
 Transaction Support Agreement

Pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement, the Sponsor agreed, among other things, (i) to vote all equity securities of the company in favor of the Transactions, (ii) not to transfer or sell any of such equity securities, (iii) not to solicit or engage in discussions with respect to an alternative business combination transaction, and (iv) to waive anti-dilution protections with respect to its Class B Ordinary Shares of the company. The Transaction Support Agreement will terminate in its entirety, and be of no further force or effect, upon a valid termination of the Merger Agreement. 
KORE Holders Support Agreement 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the company entered into a support agreement (the KORE Holders Support Agreement) with KORE and certain stockholders of KORE (the Requisite KORE Stockholders). Pursuant to KORE Holders Support Agreement, the Requisite KORE Stockholders agreed to, among other things, vote to adopt and approve, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) after the registration statement is declared effective and delivered or otherwise made available to stockholders, the Merger Agreement and all other documents and transactions contemplated thereby, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of KORE Holders Support Agreement. KORE Stockholders also agreed, among other things, to refrain from (i) transferring their covered shares prior to the termination of the KORE Holders Support Agreement and (ii) joining any class actions with respect to any claim against the company. In addition, certain stockholders agreed to exercise their drag-along rights in connection with the Transactions, subject to the terms and conditions of KORE Holders Support Agreement. The KORE Holders Support Agreement will terminate in its entirety, and be of no further force or effect, upon the valid termination of the Merger Agreement.

 The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement, Investor Rights Agreement, Subscription Agreements, Transaction Support Agreement and KORE Holders Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the respective agreements (as may, from time-to-time, be amended or supplemented in accordance with their terms), copies of which are filed as exhibits to this annual report on Form 10-K. The aforementioned agreements and the foregoing descriptions thereof have been included to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding the terms of such agreements, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the respective agreements (either in final (for documents executed as of the date hereof) or substantially final (for documents which are unexecuted as of the date hereof) form. They are not intended to provide any other factual information about the parties to the respective agreements. The respective representations, warranties and covenants contained in such agreements were made only as of specified dates for the purposes of each such agreement, were solely for the benefit of the parties to each such agreement and may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed upon by such parties. In particular, in reviewing the respective representations, warranties and covenants contained in each such agreement and discussed in the respective foregoing description, it is important to bear in mind that such representations, warranties and covenants were negotiated with the principal purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts.

 Our Founders 
 Timothy M. Donahue serves as our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors. Mr. Donahue has been a senior advisor to Cerberus operations group since 2009 and brings vast experience, deep relationships and strategic vision to investing in ICT. Mr. Donahue is the former Chairman of Sprint Nextel where he grew the companys market capitalization from approximately $16 billion to approximately $40 billion during the period from July 1999 to July 2005. 
 In addition to Mr. Bruno and Mr. Donahue, our board of directors includes industry veterans Dr. Shaygan Kheradpir (former Chief Executive Officer of Juniper Networks and Coriant), who serves as our Chief Technology Officer and Dr. Hossein Moiin (former Chief Technology Officer of Nokia), Timothy Kasbe Robert C. Davenport (Head of Global Corporate Credit and Distressed Debt at Cerberus). Our Advisory Board plays an instrumental role in sourcing and assessing technology of potential business combination targets and is comprised of Dr. Kheradpir, Dr. Moiin, Tamara L. Casey (former Vice President of Technology at Nextel), Shervin Gerami (Chief Executive Officer of TeleWorld) and Peter Foyo (former Chief Executive Officer of Nextel Mexico). 
 Jeffrey L. Lomasky (Chief Financial Officer of Cerberus for more than 26 years) serves as our Chief Financial Officer. Nicholas P. Robinson and Michael K. Palmer, who help manage ICT investments for Cerberus, serve as Co-Chief Investment Officers. 
 In addition to benefiting from the resources of our management, our board of directors, our Advisory Board, and the broader Cerberus organization, our sponsor leverage Cerberus proprietary operational platforms, 
 
5 


  including Cerberus Technology Solutions, LLC (together with other similarly situated, affiliated entities, CTS) and Cerberus Operations and Advisory Company, LLC (together with other similarly situated, affiliated entities, COAC), which supports our disciplined investment process and subsequent business management and strategic value creation initiatives following a business combination. 
 The company is targeting ICT companies that benefit from the transformational, long-term impacts of capital deployment in the 5G stack. Such companies may include network operators (mobile operators, fiber operators, datacenters and tower companies), equipment vendors, device makers, semiconductor providers, IT and cloud services, network optimization, ICT software and applications companies. Opportunities are being sourced from our management and Advisors and their extensive network of executives, investors, and advisors and the broader Cerberus organization. The company is targeting assets with growing market presence, which would benefit from our investment and influence. The company is seeking to utilize its experienced team to address strategic opportunities, capital needs, and regulatory considerations. 
 Industry Opportunity 
 While we may acquire a business in any industry, our focus is on ICT in the United States and other developed countries. We believe ICT is attractive for a number of reasons. 

 | 5G Technology and Compelling Long-term Growth Prospects. As the World Economic Forum has stated, we believe 5G will change the world even more profoundly than 3G or 4G and be as revolutionary as electricity or the automobile. 5G promises to allow networks to harness data and machine learning for the purpose of more efficient control of physical processes that span every aspect of the economy. The technology allows for faster download speeds, lower latency, higher device density, higher reliability, and more network capabilities. Put simply, consumers will have access to better quality wireless communications, more data, and new services. Businesses will benefit from the same, as well as from machine-to-machine (so-called internet of things) capabilities that allow for real-time process optimization, critical information management, as well as certain machine learning / artificial intelligence applications. We believe that the 5G capital cycle will be longer than 4G or 3G and that it enables strong secular tailwinds.

 | Large Target Market Active in M&A. The sector has substantial actionable targets of meaningful scale that fit our acquisition criteria. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, over the past 5 years, the sector has benefited from robust global M&A deal flow with over 259 transactions completed between $1 billion and $10 billion, with a cumulative deal volume of over $670 billion. Additionally, private equity activity has ballooned, with ICT representing more than 27% of all private equity TMT M&A activity. In particular, alternative investment firms have raised telecom infrastructure funds, $98 billion of capital raised and $54 billion capital deployed across 52 funds since 2015. We expect such funds may seek to maximize investment performance through a business combination with us, as an alternative to an IPO.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Attractive Competitive Dynamics. Our management team believes that the complexity of the ICT industry acts as a barrier to entry, requiring investors to have significant sector-specific knowledge and expertise to identify and appropriately analyze investment opportunities. Technical knowledge, an understanding of the regulatory landscape, complex valuation methodologies, specialized accounting treatments, and regulatory and political considerations may deter competition from generalist firms. As of this proposed offering, we believe few, if any, blank check companies exist with such a team able to focus squarely on this industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Consolidation Opportunities. Across multiple sectors within ICT, key players have looked to consolidate and scale to compete and deploy capital in the next generation of wireless and broadband technology. We believe that todays environment makes for sourcing a differentiated opportunity and consummating a business combination.

 Business Strategy and Acquisition Criteria 
 Upon completion of our initial public offering, we started communicating with our managements network of relationships to identify a target that complements the experience of our management and board of directors and can benefit from their operational, technological and investment expertise and have begun the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities. 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 We are focusing our search for a business combination target on information and communications technology (ICT) and, in particular, ICT companies that benefit from the transformational, long-term impacts of capital deployment in the 5G stack. Such companies may include network operators (mobile operators, fiber operators, datacenters and tower companies), equipment vendors, device makers, semiconductor providers, IT and cloud services, network optimization, and ICT software and applications companies. 
 We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe: 
 

 | are growth-oriented, market-leading companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | have a durable and/or defensible market position, with demonstrated competitive advantages to maintain barriers to entry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | have recurring, predictable revenues and the history of, or the near-term potential to, generate stable and sustainable free cash flow;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | have strong management teams with a track record of driving growth and profitability, and would benefit from our managements network and expertise, capital structure optimization, acquisition advice or operational and technological changes to drive improved financial performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | are fundamentally sound companies that may currently be underperforming their potential;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital and a need for capital to achieve the companys growth strategy, that we believe may have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders, potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | can benefit from being publicly traded, are prepared to be a publicly traded company and can utilize access to broader capital markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination, including with KORE, may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC. 
 In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.

 Competitive Advantages 
 We believe that there is growing capital needs among ICT companies based on rapid growth in the digital economy, specifically linked to 5G technology and innovation. We are targeting an asset with growing market presence, which would benefit from our investment and influence. We utilize our ICT operating and investment teams, as well as Cerberus experience and resources, to address operational challenges, capital needs, and regulatory considerations to generate value post-closing. 

 | Experienced Alternative Asset Manager Through Multiple Economic Cycles. Since 1992, Cerberus has been a leader in global investing across the capital structure and multiple asset classes, including private equity, credit, and real estate. Since inception, Cerberus has invested approximately $125 billion of capital and today it has approximately $48 billion in assets under management across 22 offices globally. Since inception, Cerberus has successfully invested over $5 billion in ICT.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Skilled Operating Professionals with Relevant ICT Experience. Cerberus, through its affiliate, COAC, employs and or retains a large team of operating professionals and consultants, which together, form one of the largest dedicated, full-time operations teams in the industry. Cerberus also has an established advisory network of professional technology and telecom experts, who have led or held directorships in telecommunications companies globally (e.g., Nextel, Verizon, Nokia, and MTN). COAC and our advisors drive deal diligence and development, assist in sourcing, as well as provide significant expertise in operational planning and board oversight.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Best in Class ICT Team with Deep Knowledge of 5G Tech Stack. Members of our team have held various leadership positions at companies that pioneered, designed, built, and operated 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G LTE systems worldwide. Several have analyzed and led construction of technology for the Department of Defense and U.S. Intelligence Community, including the Central Intelligence Agency. Many still advise leading companies and the U.S. government on all aspects of 5G technology, working with leading research and development labs to understand next generation capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Manager and Employees with Critical Insight and Alignment with U.S. Policy. Our team is deeply knowledgeable of U.S. policy objectives. Cerberus has a history of operating regulated businesses in the US, Europe and emerging markets. We maintain current and former members of various government bodies and advisor boards who provide expert testimony and guidance on regulatory matters. Former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle has been with Cerberus since 1999 and currently serves as Chairman of Cerberus Global Investments, LLC. Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow has been with Cerberus since 2006 and currently serves as Chairman of Cerberus. Through Vice President Quayle, Secretary Snow and other key Cerberus leaders, we have regular and ongoing discussions with key leaders across governments, vendors, integrators, and operators.

Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We also utilize our management teams operational, transaction, and capital planning experience along with resources from our affiliates, CTS and COAC. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or Advisors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or Advisors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

 Our officers, directors and Advisors, directly or indirectly, own founder shares and private placement warrants following our initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers, directors and Advisors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.

 Cerberus Operations and Advisory Company, LLC 
 COAC employs and/or retains a large team of operating professionals and consultants who drive deal diligence and development, assist in sourcing, as well as provide significant expertise in operational planning and board oversight. Periodically, members of COAC also take temporary or indefinite positions on the management teams of Cerberus portfolio companies, particularly in cases, such as corporate divestitures, where the management team is not fully complete upon consummation of an acquisition. We believe that few, if any, other alternative investment managers maintain a staff of operating and execution resources of comparable size and differentiated and extensive experience. The business executives comprising COAC can be grouped into three general categories: 

 | former chief executive officers, chief operating officers, chief financial officers, or other senior leaders of large companies or of large business units of companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | functional experts with significant operating experience managing specific business functions, such as strategy, commercial effectiveness (including new product development, branding, pricing, sales, marketing and communications), technology, human resources, supply chain, treasury, financial planning and analysis, risk management, or legal (including regulatory affairs and environmental, social and governance); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | individuals with middle management, project management, or operational enhancement and turnaround experience, many of them trained in disciplines such as Six Sigma and other quality or efficiency/ productivity techniques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to these executives, COAC maintains a Competitiveness Council consisting of well-regarded senior business executives who provide advice across a wide array of industries. 
 COAC team members collectively have operating expertise in a wide range of industries on a global basis, including, but not limited to, business services, telecommunications, media, financial services and technology. In exchange for reasonable arms length consideration agreed between the company and COAC from time to time, COAC assists our management and other members of our board of directors with identifying suitable acquisition candidates, conducting due diligence and operational planning, negotiating and executing our initial business combination and, thereafter, helping to plan and execute value enhancing operational plans and initiatives. COAC is entitled to fees and/or reimbursement of certain direct and allocable costs, including allocable compensation costs, to the extent that members of COAC provide services to our company before or after our initial business combination. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target companys business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the companys assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed 
 
10 


  to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Other Considerations 
 Cerberus manages multiple investment vehicles, and Cerberus will raise additional funds and/or successor funds in the future (collectively the Cerberus Funds and Accounts), which may be during the period in which we are seeking our initial business combination. Although we intend, to seek a business combination with a company that would not be an appropriate opportunity for the Cerberus Funds and Accounts, the Cerberus Funds and Accounts (and/or the portfolio companies of any of the foregoing) may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. However, we do not expect that this would adversely affect our ability to consummate our initial business combination because our investment mandate is different from the current investment mandate of the Cerberus Funds and Accounts. Accordingly, the potential targets for a business combination are not expected to be appropriate investments for the Cerberus Funds and Accounts, including, without limitation, because: (i) the expected risk-adjusted returns acceptable to us with respect to any potential business combination may not meet the investment parameters of the Cerberus Funds and Accounts; (ii) of differences then existing between Cerberus general private equity and other strategies and our business strategy; and (iii) the fact that the post-
 
11 


  business combination entity will be a public company, which may not be an appropriate investment for one or more of the Cerberus Funds and Accounts, which are expected to generally target companies that are more suitable for an operational private equity investment program. 
 In addition, certain of our officers, directors and Advisors presently have, and any of them in the future will have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, the Cerberus Funds and Accounts and certain companies in which Cerberus or such entities have invested. As a result, if any of our officers, directors or Advisors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any Cerberus Funds and Accounts), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If the Cerberus Funds and Accounts or other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In particular, our management will present any prospective business combination targets to Cerberus private equity investment committee to determine if such investment is appropriate and/or available for an investment by the Cerberus Funds and Accounts, including KORE. If it is determined that such investment is appropriate for the Cerberus Funds and Accounts, such opportunity will be pursued by such Cerberus Funds and Accounts in accordance with current policies and procedures and generally not the company. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. In particular, affiliates of our sponsor currently sponsor another blank check company, CTAC II, and Mr.Bruno is the Chairman of CTAC II, Mr. Donahue is the Chief Executive Officer of CTAC II, Dr. Kheradpir is the Chief Technology Officer of CTAC II, Mr. Lomasky is the Chief Financial Officer of CTAC II, Mr. Robinson is the Co-Chief Investment Officer of CTAC II, Mr. Palmer is the Co-Chief Investment Officer of CTAC II and Dr. Moiin, Mr. Kasbe and Mr. Davenport will be appointed to CTAC IIs Board of Directors upon the consummation of its proposed initial public offering. In the event the transaction with KORE is not consummated, to the extent we are continuing to search for a target business in the ICT industry at the same time as CTAC II, it will present a conflict of interest in that management may be inclined to present opportunities to us first given we have less remaining time to consummate a business combination than the company. We believe there are sufficient possible target companies in the ICT industry that this should not prevent or hinder us from finding a suitable target in the ICT industry at the same time as CTAC II. 
 In addition, Cerberus and our officers, directors, Advisors and COAC and CTS, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, Cerberus and certain of our officers, directors and Advisors have and will have in the future time and attention requirements for current and future Cerberus Funds and Accounts as well as CTAC II. To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, CTAC II, the Cerberus Funds and Accounts, Cerberus and its affiliates will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual and other duties under Cayman Islands law and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and Advisors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, including KORE. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, 
 
12 


  the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 While we believe that our structure and our management teams backgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Financial Position 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $259,173,293 held in the trust account, excluding payment of $9,070,915 of deferred underwriting fees payable upon consummation of our initial business combination. With the funds available, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance 
 
13 


  sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various affiliated sources, including COAC or CTS, and unaffiliated sources, including, investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors and Advisors, as well as their affiliates, and COAC or CTS and other affiliated sources may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of unaffiliated professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finders fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or their respective affiliates be paid by us any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, COAC and CTS, which are affiliates of our sponsor and certain of our officers, directors, and Advisors, will be entitled to fees and/or certain direct and allocable compensation costs, as well as reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses, to the extent that members of COAC or CTS or our Advisors provide services to us before our initial business combination. We have agreed to pay our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.

 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management teams operational and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. However, COAC and CTS, which are affiliates of our sponsor and certain of our officers and directors, and our Advisors, will be entitled to certain direct and allocable compensation costs, as well as reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses, to the extent that members of COAC or CTS or our Advisors provide services to us before our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team 
 Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 
15 


 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 Under the NYSEs listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 

 | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering and excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 

 | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, Advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, Advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have 
 
16 


  not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, Advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors, Advisors and/or their affiliates may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors, Advisors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, Advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, Advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors, Advisors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases will be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account 
 
17 


  and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules. 
 
18 


 If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a shareholder meeting are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares, private placement shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial purchasers founder shares, we would need 4,718,838 or 18.8% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted), of the 25,000,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 
 If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.

 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 
 If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking 
 
20 


  to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we have only 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. 
 Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). 
 Our sponsor, executive officers, directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our 
 
21 


  public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or, or any other person. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $2 million held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The representatives of the underwriters will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax 
 
22 


  obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the representatives of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $2 million following our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement units with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public shareholders are be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and 
 
23 


  restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Facilities 
 We currently maintain our executive offices at 875 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay to our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We currently have six executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In 
 
24 


  accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 Prior to the date of this Report, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 
25 


 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
