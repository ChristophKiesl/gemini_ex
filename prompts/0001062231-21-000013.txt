•In addition to maintaining and building upon our longstanding relationships with GM, FCA and Ford we are focused on generating profitable growth with new and existing global customers. New business launches in 2020 included key customers such as Daimler AG and Ashok Leyland Ltd.
•Electrification is a growing portion of our new and incremental business backlog, as well as our quoted and emerging new business opportunities, and is a significant element of our future growth strategy. 
•We continue to evaluate and consider strategic opportunities that will complement our core strengths and supplement our diversification strategies while providing future, profitable growth prospects. 
We are focused on increasing our presence in global markets to support our customers' platforms.
•As our customers design their products for global markets, they will continue to require global support from their suppliers.

Competition

We compete with a variety of independent suppliers and distributors, as well as with the in-house operations of certain vertically integrated OEMs. Technology, design, quality and cost are the primary elements of competition in our industry segments. In addition to traditional competitors in the automotive sector, the trend toward electrification and advanced electronic integration has increased the level of new market entrants. Further, some traditional automotive industry participants are developing strategic partnerships with technology companies as each party seeks to leverage the existing customer relationships and technical knowledge of the partner, and expedite the development and commercialization of new technology. 
Industry Trends 
See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Industry Trends.”

Productive Materials
We believe that we have adequate sources of supply of productive materials and components for our manufacturing needs, including steel, other metallic materials, and resources used for vehicle electrification and electronic integration.  Most raw materials (such as steel) and semi-processed or finished items are available within the geographical regions of our operating facilities from qualified sources in quantities sufficient for our needs.  We currently have contracts with our steel suppliers that ensure continuity of supply to our principal operating facilities.  We also have validation and testing capabilities that enable us to strategically qualify steel sources on a global basis. As we continue to expand our global manufacturing footprint, we may need to rely on suppliers in local markets that have not yet proven their ability to meet our requirements. 
Patents and Trademarks
We maintain and have pending various United States (U.S.) and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect our interest in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe that any single patent or trademark is material to our business, nor would expiration or invalidity of any patent or trademark have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Our operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is itself cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors. Typically, our business is moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (typically 1-2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December. Our major OEM customers also occasionally have longer shutdowns of operations (up to 6 weeks) for program changeovers. Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends.
Litigation and Environmental Matters
We are involved in, or potentially subject to, various legal proceedings or claims incidental to our business. These include, but are not limited to, matters arising out of product warranties, tax or contractual matters, and environmental obligations. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances, including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. We will continue to closely monitor our environmental conditions to ensure that we are in compliance with all laws, regulations and ordinances. We have made, and anticipate continuing to make, capital and other expenditures (including recurring administrative costs) to comply with environmental requirements at our current and former facilities. Such expenditures were not significant in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Human Capital Management
Attract, Develop, Engage and Retain Diverse Talent
Empowerment of our associates is essential to continuously improving our quality performance, technology leadership and operational excellence. We are focused on recruiting, developing and retaining high-performing talent globally. We provide our associates with the tools to develop technically and grow professionally, wherever they are in the world, into the leaders that will guide AAM into the future. 
We employ approximately 20,000 associates on a global basis (including our joint venture affiliates) of which approximately 6,300 are employed in the U.S. and approximately 13,700 are employed at our foreign locations. Approximately 4,400 are salaried associates and approximately 15,600 are hourly associates. Of the approximately 15,600 hourly associates, approximately 72% are covered under collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.
At AAM, we believe diversity drives creativity. We believe an equitable and inclusive culture encourages, supports and celebrates the unique voices of our global workforce. AAM is committed to listening, learning, and taking action that will move our company and our communities forward, together. Our cultural values of integrity, teamwork, responsibility, excellence, lean and empowerment guide our global workforce and define how we interact with each other, our communities and the environment.
Associate Health, Wellness, Safety and Development
AAM360 is our comprehensive health, wellness, safety and development program designed to provide a complete associate experience. AAM360 integrates competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing professional development and training, and associate appreciation and wellness programs, as well as community involvement initiatives. Our management utilizes AAM360 to develop and implement standards for recruitment and selection of a knowledgeable and diverse workforce, effective on-boarding, promoting learning and growth, driving effective performance and fostering an environment of open communication with AAM’s leadership. 
Through our AAM360 program, AAM management monitors workforce demographics and attrition, associate performance data, succession and development plans and feedback from associates to ensure that our associates’ experience is meeting these objectives. Our associates also have the opportunity to interact with AAM’s leaders in a variety of formats, including townhall-style meetings, and can also raise issues and concerns to the attention of management through the use of associate surveys and our 24/7 ethics hotline. 
AAM Response to Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
In response to COVID-19, we instituted several operational measures to ensure the health, safety and wellness of our associates, which included the following:
•Assembled a COVID-19 Task Force comprised of AAM's senior leadership working closely with associates across several functions and regions to coordinate decision making and communication related to actions taken by AAM to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, and to ensure that AAM is compliant with all region-specific regulations or requirements associated with COVID-19;
•Temporarily suspended or reduced production at manufacturing facilities and directed associates who could do so to work remotely;
•Initiated thorough cleaning and decontamination procedures at our facilities in preparation for resuming operations; and
•Designed additional safety measures to further protect associates as production was restored and our associates resumed working in certain of our global facilities.
S4 (S-to-the-Fourth) Safety System
At AAM, a primary responsibility is the safety of our approximately 20,000 global associates. AAM’s S4 safety system is focused on developing, engaging, monitoring, and continuously educating our associates on standardized procedures that are the basis of our safety culture and safety policy.
The primary goal of S4 is to achieve compliance with all internal and external requirements and regulations while driving behavioral changes to maintain a safe and environmentally friendly workplace. At AAM, we believe safety performance is a journey where each facility strives to achieve S4 by moving from a reactive safety environment to an interdependent safety environment.
We are focused on continuous improvement of the S4 system and in our total recordable incident rate (TRIR) in every facility. AAM’s leaders continuously monitor our facilities progress in the S4 Safety System. In 2020, our TRIR was 0.9 – a reduction of approximately 57% in recordable injuries since the S4 program began in 2015. 
Partnering with our Global Communities
AAM believes that we have a responsibility to give back to the communities in which we live and work. AAM has long-standing relationships with charitable organizations to support local families, youth outreach, education, wellness, and social equality. We support global organizations with both donations and volunteer hours, and AAM associates across the globe regularly participate in charitable and community events that allow our team to contribute to causes important to them.
