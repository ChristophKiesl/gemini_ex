Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing innovative, protein-based immunotherapies to treat cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our approach includes a proprietary scientific platform that converts native immune system proteins into differentiated, multi-targeted therapeutics. We believe our strategies are capable of meaningfully modulating the human immune system and significantly improving outcomes in patients with serious diseases. 
Autoimmune/Inflammatory Diseases
ALPN-101, or acazicolcept, is a dual Inducible T cell Costimulator, or ICOS, and CD28 antagonist intended for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Preclinical studies with acazicolcept have demonstrated efficacy in models of systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, or SjS, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, uveitis, and graft versus host disease. We have evaluated acazicolcept in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study and initiated patient dosing in Synergy, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of acazicolcept in adults with moderate-to-severe SLE. In June 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company, or AbbVie, which grants AbbVie an exclusive option to take an exclusive license to acazicolcept. Through December 31, 2021, we have received $105.0 million in upfront and pre-option exercise development milestones as part of the Option and License Agreement with AbbVie, or the AbbVie Agreement. 
ALPN-303 is a dual B cell cytokine antagonist, being developed for the treatment of B cell mediated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Engineered using our proprietary directed evolution platform, ALPN-303 potently inhibits the pleiotropic B cell cytokines B cell activating factor (BAFF, BLyS) and a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL), which play key roles in B cell development, differentiation, and survival, and together contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases such as SLE and many other autoantibody-related inflammatory diseases. Data presented at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Convergence 2021 Annual Meeting demonstrated that ALPN-303 inhibits the activity of the B cell cytokines APRIL and BAFF more potently than wild-type TACI-Fc counterparts, as well as anti-BAFF and anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies. In addition, ALPN-303 has been well-tolerated in preclinical models and exhibited superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics over wild-type TACI-Fc counterparts, including superior serum exposure, suppression of T-dependent antibody production, and/or serum immunoglobulins in mice and/or cynomolgus monkeys. A first-in-human, Phase 1 study of ALPN-303 in healthy volunteers was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, with top-line results targeted by mid-2022. This randomized, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ALPN-303 administered intravenously and subcutaneously. We are planning to initiate patient-based studies in the second half of 2022 including SLE, and possibly other autoantibody-related diseases in other therapeutic areas.
In December 2021, we entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement, or the Horizon Agreement, with Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC, or Horizon, for the development and commercialization of up to four preclinical candidates generated from our unique discovery platform for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Horizon made an upfront payment to us of $25.0 million as well as an equity investment for which they paid $15.0 million, a 25 percent premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average share price as of December 9, 2021. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $381.0 million per program, or approximately $1.5 billion in total, in future success-based payments related to development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as tiered royalties on global net sales.
Immuno-oncology
Our lead oncology program is ALPN-202, or davoceticept, a conditional CD28 costimulator and dual checkpoint inhibitor intended for the treatment of cancer. Preclinical in vivo data have demonstrated monotherapy efficacy in tumor models superior to approved therapies. In June 2020, we initiated NEON-1, a Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation and expansion study in patients with advanced malignancies. Initial data from NEON-1 were presented at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Virtual Meeting demonstrating that davoceticept was well-tolerated as of the cutoff date (April 22, 2021) with evidence of peripheral T cell modulation consistent with CD28 agonism. In addition, although most enrolled participants had tumors considered classically non-responsive to immunotherapies, the majority derived clinical benefit as defined as a best outcome of stable disease or better. Completion of dose escalation for NEON-1 and initiation of expansion cohorts is anticipated in the first half of 2022.
In June 2021, we announced a collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and efficacy of davoceticept in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study. The clinical trial, NEON-2, was initiated in June 2021and is currently subject to a partial clinical hold. As discussed further below, on March 7, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the NEON-2 trial in response to the death of a study participant in the NEON-2 trial. The participant’s death was attributed to cardiogenic shock, considered by the treating physicians as likely related to immune-mediated myocarditis, or possibly infection. Participants who are currently enrolled in the NEON-2 trial may continue to receive davoceticept and pembrolizumab, although no new participants may be enrolled until the partial clinical hold is resolved. This partial clinical hold does not affect the ongoing NEON-1 clinical trial of davoceticept as monotherapy (NCT04186637).
Our scientific platform has also generated immune modulatory proteins with the potential of improving engineered cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, T cell receptor-engineered T cells, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In May 2019, we signed a collaboration and license agreement with Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, or Adaptimmune, to develop next-generation SPEAR™ T cell products which incorporate our secreted and transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (termed SIP™ and TIP™) technology. We intend to continue to leverage our existing pipeline and platform to actively explore and evaluate potential value-creating partnering opportunities.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to discover and develop modern therapies to treat patients with serious conditions such as cancer and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. To achieve our goals, we intend to:
•aggressively move our lead autoimmune/inflammatory program acazicolcept through clinical development as part of the AbbVie Agreement, including conducting Synergy, our Phase 2 study for the treatment of SLE;
•aggressively move our second autoimmune/inflammatory program ALPN-303 through a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and into patient-based studies for the treatment of B cell mediated autoimmune/inflammatory diseases;
•aggressively move our lead oncology program davoceticept through clinical development for the treatment of cancer, and;
•maximize the value of our pipeline and platform via potential partnering activities.
Product Pipeline
We have a diverse pipeline of novel therapies, as shown in Figure 1 below. 
Figure 1
Our Scientific Platform
The human immune system is a complex network of biological processes and structures evolved to protect humans from external infections and harmful changes of internal cells. Within the immune system, proteins play a key role in a variety of essential functions, including recognition of foreign and self-antigens, cell adhesion and trafficking, and modulation of cellular activity through costimulatory or inhibitory signaling. Our scientific platform seeks to develop novel therapeutics by engineering native, or so-called “wild-type,” proteins with unique properties that may benefit patients with cancer or inflammatory diseases. We have focused our efforts to-date on two major protein superfamilies that play critical roles in the regulation of immune cell signaling and activity: the immunoglobulin superfamily, or IgSF, and the tumor necrosis factor (receptor) superfamily, or TNFSF/TNFRSF. 
The IgSF is the largest family of adhesion, costimulatory (activating), and inhibitory (blocking) proteins found on the surface of immunological, neurological, and other human cell types. These cell surface and soluble molecules are broadly involved with recognition of antigens, assisting in the formation of the immune synapse, and performing costimulatory, coinhibitory, and cytokine receptor signaling functions. This family includes many well-known targets, such as those seen in Figure 2. We believe the IgSF protein family members may be particularly valuable because many IgSF proteins naturally bind multiple binding partners, also referred to as “counterstructures.” Acazicolcept and davoceticept are both derived from members of the IgSF.
Figure 2
TNFSF/TNFRSF proteins are expressed broadly in the immune system and play a critical role in immune cell signaling and proliferation. TNFSF/TNFRSF members are composed of 48 unique proteins that are structurally similar and are 
characterized by their ability to bind to trimeric tumor necrosis factors (Figure 3). Members of the TNFSF/TNFRSF include many clinically relevant targets with applications in both autoimmune disease and immuno-oncology (e.g., CD40, TACI, BCMA, 4-1BB, TNFα). 
The TNF Superfamily
Figure 3
Our scientists create engineered proteins from IgSF members (variant immunoglobulin domains, or vIgDs) and TNFSF/TNFRSF members (variant TNF domains, or vTDs). We use directed evolution, which is an iterative scientific engineering process purposefully conducted to modify an IgSF and TNFSF/TNFRSF protein for a desired therapeutic function. The potential to create therapies capable of working within a formed immune synapse, forcing a synapse to occur, or preventing a synapse from occurring are important, novel attributes of our scientific platform.
Figure 4 illustrates the process of directed evolution in our scientific platform. Our scientists utilize yeast display protein library strategies to identify variants of wild-type proteins with desired binding characteristics. We start with a wild-type IgSF or TNFSF/TNFRSF protein and then enter a cycle of library generation and yeast display. Flow cytometry or other methods are used to sort for yeast clones displaying variants with desired binding characteristics. Biologic and biophysical assays of purified proteins assess biological function and manufacturing characteristics. The end product is an optimized vIgD or vTD. Additional cycles can be carried out by building next generation libraries from the output of prior libraries to result in further optimization.
Figure 4
Our scientific platform is generally able to improve upon native IgSF or TNFSF/TNFRSF activity regardless of whether natural binding affinity is weak or strong. When starting affinity is very weak, techniques employed by our scientists have accomplished several thousand-fold increases in binding affinity with sometimes as few as two library generation cycles. Even when starting affinity is very high, our scientific platform can still improve binding affinities. The same general strategies can be used when the desired therapeutic profile requires reduced affinity compared to the wild-type protein. We have applied our scientific platform to several IgSF and TNFSF/TNFRSF protein targets.
We believe our vIgDs and vTDs are highly flexible. In many cases, a single affinity-maturation campaign can result in multiple domains suitable for use in the formats such as those illustrated in Figure 5 and further described below.
Figure 5
vIgD-Fc or vTD-Fc
A vIgD- or vTD-Fc fusion protein is the simplest format. Our lead autoimmune/inflammatory program, acazicolcept, and lead oncology program, davoceticept, are both examples of vIgD-Fc formats. ALPN-303 is an example of a vTD-Fc format. The engineered vIgD or vTD protein is fused to an Fc backbone. Combining vIgDs or vTDs with antibody Fc domains to make Fc fusion proteins potentially allows for better expression, facilitates purification, and improves pharmacokinetic (dosing) properties. Fc fusion proteins are a standard format in the industry, with examples such as etanercept, abatacept, and belatacept. A vIgD- or vTD-Fc could potentially be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, or via other methods of delivery.
Cell Therapy Enhancement
Our scientific platform has also generated immune modulatory proteins with the potential of improving engineered cellular therapies, such as CAR-Ts, TCR-Ts, or TILs.
Acazicolcept, a Dual ICOS/CD28 Antagonist for Autoimmune/Inflammatory Diseases
Our lead autoimmune/inflammatory disease program, acazicolcept, is an Fc fusion protein of a human inducible T cell costimulator ligand, or ICOSL, vIgD designed to inhibit simultaneously the CD28 and ICOS T cell costimulatory pathways (Figure 6). This vIgD is fused to an “effectorless” Fc backbone and is intended for the potential treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. Notably, acazicolcept is not a bispecific antibody construct. A traditional bispecific might be constructed of one domain binding ICOS and one domain binding CD28. Instead, acazicolcept makes use of a novel single vIgD domain capable of binding both ICOS and CD28 engineered by our scientists using our proprietary scientific platform.
Figure 6
CD28 has been long recognized to be required for naïve T cell activation. The therapeutic inhibitors of the CD28 pathway (e.g., abatacept, CTLA4-Ig; and belatacept, a second generation CTLA4-Ig) have proven valuable for the treatment of some inflammatory arthritis conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis) and for the prevention of renal allograft rejection or graft versus host disease. However, therapeutic blockade of the CD28 pathway, primarily as studied with abatacept, has not been successful in several other inflammatory diseases (e.g., Crohn’s disease, lupus nephritis, multiple sclerosis) despite extensive evidence implicating T cells in disease pathogenesis and evidence of clinical biological activity. This suggests an additional pathogenic costimulatory pathway(s) remains unaddressed.
ICOS is part of the CD28 costimulatory family of molecules, including PD-1, CD28, and CTLA-4. ICOS is related to CD28, but, in contrast, is poorly expressed in naïve T cells. ICOS is, however, rapidly induced upon T cell activation. It appears to be a dominant costimulatory pathway in at least some effector or pathogenic T cells, such as potentially in the absence of CD28. Elevated levels of ICOS‑expressing T cells have been described in an increasing number of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, correlating with disease activity. At the same time, inhibition of ICOS is effective in several preclinical inflammatory disease models. The ICOS pathway may therefore represent a major costimulatory pathway, nonredundant with CD28, and highly relevant to autoimmune/inflammatory diseases.
We have performed a number of preclinical experiments demonstrating acazicolcept is active in both in vitro and in vivo models, several of which are described below.
A potent immunomodulator of diseased cells
Acazicolcept inhibits cytokine production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro more potently than single CD28 (abatacept, or CTLA4-Ig) or ICOS (prezalumab, or anti-ICOSL mAb) pathway inhibitors alone or in combination (Figure 7).
Figure 7
Sjögren’s Syndrome Model
Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which immune cells attack the glands that produce saliva and tears, as well as other internal organs. In an animal model of salivary gland inflammation (sialoadenitis), a key organ manifestation of Sjögren’s syndrome, acazicolcept appeared more efficacious in reducing the incidence and severity of sialadenitis as compared to abatacept or wild-type ICOSL-Fc alone or in combination. These data were presented at the 2019 annual meeting of the ACR. (Figure 8)
Figure 8
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Model
Acazicolcept has demonstrated efficacy in a preclinical model of SLE, a multiorgan autoimmune disease that that can lead to serious organ complications and death. In Figure 9, which evaluated acazicolcept in a bm12 inducible model of SLE, treatment with acazicolcept reduced serum titers of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies throughout the study compared to Fc control treatment. These data were presented at the 2019 annual meeting of the ACR. We evaluated acazicolcept in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study and in the second quarter of 2021 initiated patient dosing in Synergy, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of acazicolcept in adults with moderate-to-severe SLE.
Figure 9
Arthritis Model
Figure 10 shows data from an in vivo collagen-induced arthritis model. This model is designed to test a drug’s ability to reduce inflammatory signals thought to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and other types of inflammatory arthritis conditions. In the data presented at the 2019 annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, acazicolcept was superior to abatacept, a drug approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid, psoriatic, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Figure 10
Human Xenograft GVHD Model
Acazicolcept has been studied in an in vivo mouse model of GVHD, a damaging and potentially fatal inflammatory disease frequently observed following allogeneic stem cell and/or bone marrow transplant treatments for cancer or other serious diseases. The results represented in Figure 11 show acazicolcept had superior survival when dosed three times per week for four weeks compared to belatacept (an FDA-approved drug for prevention of renal allograft rejection - a type of inflammation-related rejection process analogous to GVHD. Belatacept is a more potent variant of abatacept, which is FDA-approved for the prevention of GVHD). In fact, 100% of acazicolcept multi-dose treated animals across three different dose levels survived. Animals given only a single dose of acazicolcept performed comparably to animals treated with belatacept dosed 3x/week for four weeks, demonstrating the potency and efficacy of acazicolcept in this disease model.
Figure 11
Summary of acazicolcept Program Preclinical Data
Our scientists and collaborators have demonstrated in in vivo preclinical studies that acazicolcept:
•demonstrates a lower incidence and severity of sialadenitis, a model of Sjögren’s syndrome, as compared to abatacept or wild-type ICOSL-Fc alone or in combination;
•reduces levels of pathogenic anti-dsDNA autoantibodies compared to an Fc control in an animal model of SLE; 
•reduces disease severity and delays disease onset time relative to control in an in vivo arthritis model with activity superior to abatacept, an FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid, psoriatic, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis;
•improves survival compared to belatacept in a humanized in vivo mouse GVHD model;
•demonstrates control of colitis in an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD; and
•shows improved disease scores in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, or MS, compared to abatacept.
Acazicolcept Clinical Development
We have completed a Phase 1 study of acazicolcept in healthy volunteers (NCT03748836). This study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending intravenous and/or subcutaneous doses of acazicolcept. In addition, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory biomarkers were evaluated to help determine acazicolcept’s potential for the treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. Results of the study were presented at the 2020 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) E-Congress and published in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Translational Science (doi:10.1111/cts.12983). The first-in-human study randomized 96 healthy adults to receive single or multiple, intravenous or subcutaneous, placebo or acazicolcept at doses ranging from 1 μg/kg to 10 mg/kg. At all dose levels, acazicolcept was well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events, clinically-significant immunogenicity events, or evidence of cytokine release. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Figure 12) exhibited desirable dose dependence, with increasing doses corresponding to increasing duration of complete, or near-complete target saturation, as well as inhibition of antibody responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or KLH, immunization. 
Figure 12
Supported by these results, and as part of the AbbVie Agreement, we initiated Synergy, an international, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of acazicolcept in patients with SLE in mid-2021.
Davoceticept, a Conditional CD28 Costimulator and Dual PD-L1/CTLA-4 Inhibitor for Oncology
Immune checkpoint blockade using inhibitors of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, or CTLA-4, or programmed death 1, or PD-1, pathways have been therapeutically successful for a wide variety of malignancies, dramatically altering the 
treatment paradigm in oncology. However, the majority of patients treated with an inhibitor of CTLA-4, PD-1, or programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, fail to respond or develop resistance, indicating that additional strategies to improve anti-tumor immunity and responses remain needed to improve outcomes. Because immune checkpoints like PD-1 and CTLA-4 appear to suppress anti-tumor immune responses in part by inhibiting the activating signals mediated by cluster of differentiation 28, or CD28 (Figure 13), next generation immunotherapeutic strategies may substantially improve anti-tumor responses by activating a T cell (co-)stimulatory pathway(s) while also inhibiting a checkpoint pathway(s). Preferably, such activity might be focused primarily within the tumor microenvironment to limit potential systemic immune activation and toxicity.
Figure 13
Davoceticept is an Fc fusion protein of a modified human cluster of differentiation 80, or CD80, vIgD designed to block the inhibitory immune checkpoints PD-L1 and CTLA-4, and to provide PD-L1-dependent T cell activation via CD28 costimulatory receptor. As illustrated in Figure 14, davoceticept binds PD-L1 expressed on the tumor, blocking PD-L1/PD-1 interactions. Localized to the tumor, davoceticept is able to provide a CD28 signal to T cells (PD-L1-dependent CD28 costimulation). Additionally, davoceticept binds CTLA-4 expressed on T cells and blocks CTLA4-CD80/CD86 interactions.
Figure 14
Using in vitro assays, we have characterized and validated the three primary mechanisms of action of davoceticept: conditional CD28 costimulation and dual PD-L1/CTLA-4 inhibition (Figure 15). Importantly, CD28 costimulation with davoceticept requires both T cell receptor, or TCR, signaling and expression of PD-L1 on the antigen presenting cell, or APC. PD-L1 dependent T cell costimulation is a unique and key attribute of davoceticept which we believe may limit the risk for systemic toxicity while providing potent anti-tumor activity. 
Figure 15
Davoceticept has also been validated in in vivo tumor models. In a mouse model where mice were implanted with MC38 mouse colon cancer tumors transfected with human PD-L1, davoceticept as a monotherapy demonstrated superior tumor control compared to durvalumab, an FDA-approved anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (Figure 16).
 Figure 16                        Figure 17
When tumor-free mice in the davoceticept arm were re-challenged with additional tumors, they continued to be tumor free despite no additional doses of davoceticept. (Figure 17)
The effects of davoceticept or durvalumab on various components of the immune system were compared using a technique called RNA sequencing in the tumor model. This technique generates a display of inflammatory gene signatures where green represents lower or no upregulation of inflammatory genes and red represents higher upregulation of inflammatory genes. For the treatment of cancer, it is thought the more upregulation of the immune system - indicated by higher upregulation of inflammatory genes - potentially results in better outcomes for patients. As seen in Figure 18 below, davoceticept upregulates a broader variety of different inflammatory genes connected with several different types of immune cells compared to durvalumab.
Figure 18
Summary of davoceticept Preclinical Data
We have demonstrated in preclinical studies that davoceticept:
•exhibits three primary mechanisms of action: conditional CD28 costimulation and dual PD-L1/CTLA-4 inhibition;
•improves tumor control in a human PD-L1 transduced mouse model of colon cancer compared to the FDA approved anti PD-L1 therapeutic durvalumab; 
•demonstrates a more robust intra-tumor inflammatory signature in the mouse colon cancer model than durvalumab, potentially indicating superior immune system upregulation to fight cancer; and
•has the potential to be used as a monotherapy or in combination with standard of care chemotherapy or checkpoint only inhibition.
Davoceticept Clinical Development
In June 2020, we initiated enrollment in NEON-1, our Phase 1 study in patients with advanced malignancies (Figure 19). NEON-1 enrolls adults with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma refractory or resistant to standard therapy, including checkpoint inhibitors when indicated. Measurable disease is required for most participants, as are an ECOG status of 0 to 2 and adequate hematological, renal, and hepatic function. Safety endpoints include dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events, and 
circulating cytokines. Objective responses will be assessed by RECIST v1.1 for solid tumors and Lugano criteria for lymphoma. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will also be evaluated. More information is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04186637).
Figure 19
Initial data from NEON-1 were presented at the 2021 ASCO Virtual Meeting demonstrating that davoceticept was well-tolerated as of the cutoff date (April 22, 2021) with evidence of peripheral T cell modulation consistent with CD28 agonism. In addition, although most enrolled participants had tumors considered classically non-responsive to immunotherapies, the majority derived clinical benefit as defined as a best outcome of stable disease or better (Figure 20). Completion of dose escalation for NEON-1 and initiation of monotherapy expansion cohorts, initially cutaneous melanoma and PD-L1+ (non-melanoma) tumors, is anticipated in the first half of 2022.
Figure 20
In June 2021, we announced a collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and efficacy of davoceticept in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 1 dose escalation and 
expansion study. The clinical trial, NEON-2, was initiated in June 2021. More information for both NEON-1 (NCT04186637) and NEON-2 (NCT04920383) is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
On March 7, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the NEON-2 trial evaluating davoceticept in combination with pembrolizumab in adults with advanced malignancies. This partial clinical hold was prompted by report of a death of a study participant in the NEON-2 trial. The participant had choroidal melanoma previously treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab, and had received a single dose each of davoceticept and pembrolizumab. The participant’s death was attributed to cardiogenic shock, considered by the treating physicians as likely related to immune-mediated myocarditis, or possibly infection. We are working closely with the FDA, Merck, the study Safety Monitoring Committee, and the study investigators to further understand this event and to evaluate the appropriate safety precautions before we resume enrollment of additional participants. Participants who are currently enrolled in the NEON-2 trial may continue to receive davoceticept and pembrolizumab, although no new participants may be enrolled until the partial clinical hold is resolved. This partial clinical hold does not affect the ongoing NEON-1 clinical trial of davoceticept as monotherapy (NCT04186637). 
ALPN-303, a Dual B Cell Cytokine Antagonist for B Cell-Mediated Autoimmune/Inflammatory Diseases
ALPN-303 is a dual B cell cytokine antagonist, being developed for the treatment of B cell mediated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Engineered using our proprietary directed evolution platform, ALPN-303 is an Fc fusion protein of a human transmembrane activator and CAML interactor, or TACI, variant TNFR domain, or vTD, that potently inhibits the pleiotropic B cell cytokines BAFF and APRIL. It mediates significantly improved combined BAFF and APRIL inhibition in vitro and enhanced pharmacokinetic and immunomodulatory properties in vivo, as compared to wild-type, or WT, TACI-Fc molecules. BAFF and APRIL are TNF superfamily members that bind TACI, BCMA, and/or BAFF-R on B cells and together support B cell development, differentiation, and survival. Their co-neutralization dramatically reduces B cell survival and function, including antibody production, whereas inhibition of either BAFF or APRIL alone mediates only modest effects (Figure 21). B cell targeting therapies like the WT TACI-Fc fusions atacicept and telitacicept have demonstrated promising clinical potential in B cell-related diseases like SLE but have not yet clearly exhibited long-term and/or complete disease remissions. ALPN-303, with enhanced inhibitory activity against BAFF & APRIL, could further improve clinical outcomes.
Figure 21
Data on ALPN-303 presented at the ACR Convergence 2021 Annual Meeting demonstrated that ALPN-303 inhibited the activity of the B cell cytokines APRIL and BAFF more potently than wild-type TACI-Fc counterparts, as well as anti-BAFF and anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies. In Figure 22, ALPN-303 inhibited BAFF- and APRIL-mediated signaling in vitro with significantly lower IC50 values than WT TACI-Fc, anti-BAFF mAb, and anti-APRIL mAb comparators.
Figure 22
Administration of ALPN-303 rapidly and significantly reduced key B lymphocyte subsets including plasma cells, germinal center, and follicular B cells in a KLH immunization mouse model (Figure 23).
Figure 23
Furthermore, treatment with ALPN-303 potently suppressed anti-dsDNA auto antibodies, proteinuria, sialoadenitis, kidney lesions, and renal immune complex deposition in the (NZBxNZW)F1 lupus model (Figure 24).
Figure 24
ALPN-303 has been well-tolerated in nonclinical studies (Figure 25) and exhibited superior pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than wild-type TACI-Fc counterparts, including superior serum exposure and pharmacodynamic reduction of serum immunoglobulins in mice and/or cynomolgus monkeys (Figure 26). Based on these data, we believe that ALPN-303 represents an attractive development candidate for the treatment of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including SLE and other autoantibody-mediated diseases.
Figure 25
Figure 26
ALPN-303 Clinical Development
Enrollment in a first-in-human, Phase 1 study of ALPN-303 in healthy volunteers began in the fourth quarter of 2021, with top-line results targeted by mid-2022. This randomized, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ALPN-303 administered intravenously and subcutaneously. We are planning to initiate patient-based studies in the second half of 2022 including SLE, and possibly other autoantibody-related diseases in other therapeutic areas.
Other Research Programs
In addition to our acazicolcept, davoceticept, and ALPN-303 programs, we have a number of other research efforts underway to address cancer and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases that we intend to continue to develop either internally or together with a partner. 
Partnerships
In addition to advancing programs internally, we continue to seek partners who can bring therapeutic area experience, development expertise, commercialization capabilities, and funding to maximize the potential of our existing programs and scientific platform.
Collaboration with Horizon (December 2021)
In December 2021, we entered into the Horizon Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Horizon rights to one of our existing preclinical biologic therapeutic programs, or the Existing Program, and agreed to collaborate with Horizon in the discovery, research and preclinical development of up to three additional autoimmune and inflammatory disease programs for other designated biological targets, or the Research Programs, and products arising from the Existing Program and the Research Programs, or the Agreement Products.
Existing Program
We granted to Horizon an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under our intellectual property rights for the development, manufacture and commercialization of Agreement Products associated with the Existing Program, or the Existing Program Products, for all applications; however, Horizon has agreed not to pursue the Existing Program Products for oncology. In addition, we granted to Horizon a non-exclusive license to access our libraries of proteins and molecules for research, discovery and identification of additional compounds meeting the agreed criteria (subject to certain exceptions, including compounds reserved by us from the libraries, as set forth in the Horizon Agreement) which would be included in Horizon’s license.
We will conduct our activities under the Existing Program and deliver compounds meeting the agreed criteria pursuant to one or more deliverables plans as mutually agreed by the parties. In addition, Horizon will pay us for the costs and expenses of conducting such activities under the deliverables plans.
Research Programs
Under the Horizon Agreement, during a limited research term, we will conduct, together with Horizon, up to three Research Programs for specified biological targets selected by Horizon (subject to certain exceptions, including targets reserved by us) to discover proteins and molecules with specified attributes and biological functions, pursuant to a mutually agreed research plan for each such Research Program. Each party has the right to reserve certain targets and to replace such reserved targets or reserve more targets (up to a fixed number) through a gatekeeper mechanism. We will deliver certain compounds meeting the agreed criteria for each Research Program as mutually agreed upon by the parties. Horizon will pay us for the costs and expenses for conducting its activities under the Research Programs. As agreed between the parties, Horizon will own the inventions and intellectual property developed from the Research Programs or otherwise associated with the Agreement Products arising therefrom.

The parties will establish a joint research committee composed of an equal number of representatives from each of Alpine and Horizon, which will, among other responsibilities, oversee and govern the Existing Program and the Research Programs and review and approve research plans. The parties will also form a joint patent committee comprised of one or two representatives of each party to discuss strategy and facilitate communication and coordination for prosecution and maintenance of the relevant patents under the Horizon Agreement.
Development, Manufacture, Regulatory and Commercialization. 
Horizon will have the sole right and responsibility for the development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization of all the Agreement Products. We will provide Horizon reasonable assistance and cooperation. In addition, we have agreed during the term of the Horizon Agreement not to conduct or enable any third party to conduct the development, manufacture or commercialization of certain competing products as set forth therein.
Financial Terms
In connection with the transaction, Horizon made an upfront payment to us of $25.0 million as well as an equity investment for which they paid $15.0 million, a 25 percent premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average share price as of December 9, 2021.
In addition to the upfront payment and equity consideration, Horizon has agreed to make milestone payments to us upon our achievement of certain preclinical, clinical and regulatory and commercialization milestones, up to an aggregate amount of $381.0 million per program, or approximately $1.5 billion in total, if all milestones are met.
Horizon has further agreed to pay the Company royalties based on future net sales of the Agreement Products. For the Existing Program, such royalty percentages range from a mid-single digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage of net sales, with the specific royalty rate depending on the aggregate net sales. For each Research Program, such royalty percentages are in a range of mid-single digit percentages of net sales, with the specific royalty rate depending on the aggregate net sales. Horizon’s obligations to pay royalties with respect to an Agreement Product and country will expire after specific criteria for such Agreement Product in such country including it no longer being covered by valid claims of applicable patent rights in such country, or the Royalty Term. Royalty payments are subject to reduction in specified circumstances, including expiration of patent rights, biosimilar competition, or Horizon is required to make payments to a third party with respect to an Agreement Product.
Term and Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the Horizon Agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the Royalty Term for all Agreement Products. The Horizon Agreement is subject to customary termination provisions including termination by a party for the other party’s uncured, material breach. Additionally, Horizon may terminate the Horizon Agreement with specified prior notice in its entirety or on a Program-by-Program basis, for any or no reason.
In the event of certain terminations of the Horizon Agreement, at our request, the parties will negotiate one or more licenses for us to develop, manufacture and commercialize terminated Agreement Products.
The Horizon Agreement includes certain other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations and warranties, indemnification and confidentiality provisions.
Collaboration with AbbVie (June 2020)
In June 2020, we entered into the AbbVie Agreement, which grants to AbbVie an exclusive option to take an exclusive license to acazicolcept, or the License Option.
Under the terms of the AbbVie Agreement we granted to AbbVie an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property rights for the research, development and commercialization of acazicolcept and any other molecule owned or controlled by us that binds to or directly modulates or targets ICOS at certain agreed-upon levels, or the Compounds, on a worldwide basis for all human and non-human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the AbbVie Agreement. The License Option is immediately exercisable and will expire 90 days following our delivery of the data package described below to AbbVie, subject to certain exceptions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, or the HSR Act, if required.
Financial Terms
In connection with the execution of the AbbVie Agreement, AbbVie paid us a nonrefundable upfront payment of $60.0 million in cash. If AbbVie exercises its License Option, they will pay a one-time cash payment of $75.0 million.
In addition to the upfront payment and License Option payment, AbbVie has agreed to make cash payments upon our achievement of certain development milestones, the Alpine Development Milestones, prior to the exercise of the License Option as set forth in a written development plan, up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million. In the second quarter of 2021, we achieved $45.0 million of the Alpine Development Milestones. Following the exercise of the License Option, AbbVie has agreed to make cash payments of up to $205.0 million upon AbbVie’s achievement of certain development and commercial milestones and additional cash payments of up to $450.0 million upon AbbVie’s achievement of certain sales-based cash milestones. AbbVie has further agreed to pay royalties from a high-single digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage of net sales of any pharmaceutical product that contains a Compound, or a Licensed Product, with the specific royalty rate depending on the aggregate net sales. AbbVie’s obligations to pay royalties with respect to a Licensed Product and country will expire upon the latest of the expiration of the last to expire valid patent claim applicable to such Licensed Product in such country, 10 years from the first commercial sale of the Licensed Product in such country, and the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such Licensed Product in such country. Royalty payments are subject to reduction in specified circumstances, including expiration of patent rights, if average net sales decrease by a certain percentage after the introduction of a generic product, or if AbbVie is required to pay amounts to a third party in order commercialize a Licensed Product in a particular country.
Development Activities
Prior to the exercise of the License Option, we will conduct acazicolcept development efforts as per a development plan providing for, among other things, the generation of a data package in order for AbbVie to evaluate exercising the License Option and an itemized budget for such activities, including all activities reasonably necessary to conduct a Phase 2 clinical study of acazicolcept for the treatment of systematic lupus erythematosus; all non-clinical activities; and all CMC activities agreed to under the development plan. We will be fully responsible for all costs incurred to conduct our activities, provided that, AbbVie may be responsible for increased costs under the development plan in connection with certain material amendments agreed upon with AbbVie.
Prior to the exercise of the License Option, we will be solely responsible, at our sole cost and expense, for preparing, filing and maintaining regulatory documentation, which AbbVie will be entitled to access and review. We will also be responsible for any and all correspondence with the applicable regulatory authorities and for maintaining all data related to acazicolcept. We will be solely responsible, at our sole cost and expense, for manufacturing the compounds necessary to complete the development activities consistent with the development plan.
Governance
The parties will establish a joint governance committee, or JGC, composed of an equal number of representatives from each of Alpine and AbbVie, which will, among other responsibilities, coordinate and oversee the development activities, 
approve amendments to the development plan and discuss interactions with regulatory authorities. The chairperson of the JGC will be appointed by AbbVie. AbbVie may disband the JGC, at its sole discretion, following the exercise of the License Option.
Commercialization
Upon AbbVie’s exercise of the License Option, AbbVie and its affiliates will be solely responsible, at AbbVie’s sole cost and expense, for the development, manufacture, commercialization, and regulatory compliance of any Licensed Product. Following exercise of the License Option, AbbVie shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for one of the compounds in one indication in each of the United States and one of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, or Italy, or the Major Markets, and, following receipt of any such regulatory approval, commercialize the compound in such country.
Changes in Control
We will notify AbbVie immediately upon the closing of any change in control (as defined in the AbbVie Agreement) during the term of the AbbVie Agreement. Following the delivery of such notice, AbbVie may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to continue the AbbVie Agreement subject to certain modifications as set forth in the AbbVie Agreement, including the assumption by AbbVie of responsibility to perform certain activities previously assigned to us.
Term and Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the AbbVie Agreement shall terminate either: (i) in the event that the License Option is not exercised by AbbVie, the first day following the last day of the License Option exercise period; or (ii) in the event that the License Option is exercised by AbbVie, the date of the expiration of the last Royalty Term for the last Licensed Product.
Both us and AbbVie may terminate the AbbVie Agreement upon written notice in the event of a material breach by the other party that has not been cured within a 90-day cure period. However, if the uncured material breach is with respect to AbbVie’s obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize a Licensed Product with respect to any Major Market (but not all Major Markets), then we will only be entitled to terminate the AbbVie Agreement with respect to such Major Market(s). Both AbbVie and us may also terminate the AbbVie Agreement upon written notice if the other party voluntarily or involuntarily files for bankruptcy or insolvency, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, has a receiver or trustee appointed over substantially all of such other party’s property, proposes or is party to any dissolution or liquidation, or admits in writing its inability generally to meet such other party’s obligations as they fall due in the general course.
AbbVie may terminate the AbbVie Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis, for any or no reason, by providing at least 90 days’ prior written notice to us. AbbVie may also terminate the AbbVie Agreement upon notice to us if (i) either we or AbbVie receives a second request for additional information under the HSR Act, provided AbbVie’s notice of termination is delivered within ten business days after AbbVie becomes aware of such request or receives notice from us regarding such request or (ii) the License Option has not been exercised or clearance under the HSR Act, if required, has not occurred within 180 days of submission of the parties’ request for such clearance, provided AbbVie’s notice of termination is delivered within ten business days after the end of such 180-day period.
Upon the termination of the AbbVie Agreement in its entirety for any reason, all licenses and other rights granted (i) to AbbVie by us and (ii) to us by AbbVie shall terminate. Upon termination in certain circumstances, AbbVie has agreed to grant to us licenses to certain intellectual property that is reasonably necessary, and that was actually used by AbbVie for the development, manufacturing or commercialization of the terminated products, to research, develop and commercialize the terminated products in the terminated countries.
In lieu of terminating the AbbVie Agreement in connection with an uncured material breach or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, AbbVie may alternatively elect to continue the AbbVie Agreement subject to certain modifications, including that AbbVie will be entitled to conduct activities allocated to us under the Development Plan, subject to reimbursement by us for AbbVie’s out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such activities. If AbbVie’s right to terminate in connection with an uncured material breach or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company arises before exercise of the License Option, then the License Option exercise payment amount will be reduced by half and the amount of any then-unearned milestone payments will be reduced by half. If AbbVie’s right to terminate arises after exercise of the License Option, then the amount of any then-unearned milestone payments will be reduced by 25%.
The AbbVie Agreement includes certain other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations and warranties, indemnification and confidentiality provisions.
Collaboration with Adaptimmune Therapeutics (May 2019)
In May 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Adaptimmune, or the Adaptimmune Agreement, to develop next-generation SPEAR™ T cell products which incorporate our secreted and transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (termed SIP™ and TIP™) technology. We and Adaptimmune will collaborate on a specified number of programs to develop SIP and TIP candidates with tailored affinities and modulatory activities that may enhance the anti-tumor responses seen with Adaptimmune’s SPEAR™ T cells. For each program, Adaptimmune has an option to take a worldwide exclusive license for development and commercialization of SPEAR™ T cell products incorporating the developed SIP or TIP candidate for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Adaptimmune provided an upfront payment and will provide research funding for ongoing programs. In addition, we may be eligible for downstream development and commercialization milestones up to $288.0 million, if all pre-specified milestones for each program are achieved. In addition, we are eligible to receive low-single digit royalties on worldwide net sales of the applicable products. In February 2022, Adaptimmune selected an additional research program, triggering a $1.0 million upfront payment, which will be recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized to revenue based on employee hours contributed.
Manufacturing
We have established in-house non-current good manufacturing practices, recombinant protein generation capabilities enabling our scientific platform, including validation of new scientific discoveries in vitro and in vivo. Having protein production capabilities in-house allows more rapid progression for vIgDs and vTDs generated by our scientific platform.
We have chosen U.S.-based contract drug substance and U.S. and Australian drug product manufacturers for our initial current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, clinical trial supplies of acazicolcept, davoceticept and ALPN-303. We believe these contract manufacturers’ particular expertise in protein production, analytical development and fill/finish provide us with the capability to meet rapid timelines encompassing the development of production cell-lines to manufacturing of clinical trial quantities of the biopharmaceutical product.
We have successfully completed two cGMP manufacturing campaigns for acazicolcept and one cGMP campaign each for davoceticept and ALPN-303 and believe we have produced sufficient quantities of drug product necessary to execute our stated Synergy, NEON-1, NEON-2, and ALPN-303 Healthy volunteer clinical trials. We have not yet manufactured any of our proteins at commercial scale. 
Competition
We participate in the highly competitive sector of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals and in the subsector of immune modulation. This subsector has undergone tremendous technological advancement over the last decade due to advancements in understanding the role of the immune system across multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology and autoimmune/inflammatory disease. While we believe our novel technology platform, discovery programs, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources offer competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, public and private research institutions, and others.
Any products we successfully develop and commercialize will face competition from currently approved therapies and new therapies potentially available in the future.
The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of the companies we compete against may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Specifically, our competitors include companies developing therapies with the same target(s) as acazicolcept, davoceticept and ALPN-303 as well as companies building novel platforms to generate immunomodulatory multi-specific antibody or non-antibody-based targeting proteins, particularly in the area of oncology or autoimmunity.
See the risk factor “We face competition from entities that have developed or may develop therapeutic candidates for our target disease indications, including companies developing novel treatments and technology platforms based on modalities and technology similar to us. If these companies develop technologies or therapeutic candidates more rapidly than we do, or their technologies, including delivery technologies, are more effective, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize therapeutic candidates may be adversely affected.” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for more discussion of the effects of competition and competitors on our business.

Intellectual Property
Our scientific platform and substantially all our intellectual property have been developed internally. As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio consists of 47 granted patents and over 155 pending patent applications. Several of our initial patent applications are directed to our scientific platform itself. Other patent applications in our portfolio are directed to various target domains and research programs under development. Each of these patent applications is solely owned by us. As we continue the development of our scientific platform and target vIgDs, we intend to continue pursuing intellectual property protection for these technologies.
We have in-licensed some intellectual property and trade secret materials on a non-exclusive basis. To date, such non-exclusive in-licenses are solely related to commercially-available cell lines involved in the manufacture of our vIgD programs. To date, no other intellectual property related to our scientific platform has been in-licensed. We have out-licensed two programs under our TIP/SIP technology to Adaptimmune on an exclusive basis. Additionally, pursuant to the AbbVie Agreement, we have granted AbbVie an exclusive option to purchase an exclusive worldwide license to acazicolcept. If AbbVie exercises the License Option, AbbVie will take over the future development and commercialization. Finally, pursuant to the Horizon Agreement, we have granted Horizon an exclusive license of certain intellectual property and have entered into a collaboration for the development and commercialization of up to four preclinical candidates generated from Alpine’s unique discovery platform. These candidates include previously undisclosed multi-specific fusion protein-based therapeutic candidates for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. No other out-licenses have been made. 
Although we do not believe our technology infringes any intellectual property rights owned by third parties, we are aware of one or more patents and patent applications that may relate to our technology. Third parties may assert claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights regardless of whether their allegations have merit. Allegations of infringement could harm our reputation, may result in the expenditure of significant resources to defend and resolve such allegations, and could require us to pay monetary damages if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements on the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of therapeutic candidates. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of therapeutic candidates and products.
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices, and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health 
Service Act. Our potential therapeutic candidates and products will be subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the U.S. None of our therapeutic candidates have been approved by the FDA for marketing in the U.S., and we currently have no BLAs pending. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before biologic therapeutic candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice, or cGLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale, or shipment of the therapeutic product.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain any approvals for our therapeutic candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Once a therapeutic candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of protein chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. Currently, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the therapeutic candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. For each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial, an institutional review board, or IRB, must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice requirements, including the requirements for informed consent.
All clinical research performed in the U.S. in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.
Clinical Trials
For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the therapeutic candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the therapeutic candidate for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study, evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, determine a dosage schedule, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
•Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly definitive efficacy studies of the experimental medication. Phase 3 trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate a dose range of the therapeutic candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the therapeutic candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate the therapeutic candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, the FDA has issued guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including certain reporting requirements, and additional guidance on the good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection and other topics. We may be required to make further adjustments to our clinical trials or business operations based on current or future guidance and regulatory requirements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Biologics License Applications
The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the chemistry, pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and the clinical effects of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a biologic is safe, pure, and potent and whether the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA will review the application and respond to the applicant, but the review process may be significantly delayed by FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA evaluates a standard original BLA submission within the first 60 days of its receipt to determine if it is sufficiently complete to conduct a full review, and the FDA has a goal of responding to the submission within ten months of the 60-day filing date, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and/or recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or for any reason, or it may require additional clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Once the FDA approves a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the biologic reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not 
be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such biologic or require a recall of any biologic already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
A sponsor may also seek approval of its therapeutic candidates under programs designed to accelerate FDA review and approval of BLAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a therapeutic candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments, under the FDA’s accelerated approval program. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval confirmatory clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint.
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a new category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be subject to accelerated approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
Therapeutic candidates may also be eligible for “priority review,” or review within a six-month timeframe from the 60-day filing date, if a sponsor provides sufficient clinical data demonstrating its therapeutic candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed products. Even if a therapeutic candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide the therapeutic candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation and/or accelerated approval for our biologics. We cannot predict whether any of our therapeutic candidates will obtain a fast track and/or accelerated approval designation and, if so, whether such designation will be maintained or rescinded by FDA, or the ultimate impact, if any, of the fast track or the accelerated approval process on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval of any of our proposed biologics.
Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes, equipment, or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance and will not approve the biologic unless compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements is satisfactory.
The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our therapeutic candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing our therapeutic candidates. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals restricting the commercial application of the products. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, change in personnel, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement which may require additional studies to evaluate the effect of such change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product—must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. As with new BLAs, the review process for BLA supplements may be delayed by the FDA through requests for additional information or clarification.
We believe any of our therapeutic products approved as a biological product under a BLA might qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity currently permitted by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. Specifically, the BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted by an applicant until four years after the date the reference product was first licensed and cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was first licensed under a BLA. There is a risk the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period or the FDA will not consider our therapeutic candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA and the courts. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes operating to limit the scope or length of exclusivity afforded by the BPCIA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products or for abbreviated pathways for follow on biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity.
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a therapeutic candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that therapeutic candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application for the therapeutic for that particular rare disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The FDA may revoke orphan drug designation, and if it does, it will publicize the drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. If a therapeutic candidate with orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the therapeutic candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same therapeutic candidate as defined by the FDA or if our therapeutic candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s therapeutic candidate for the same indication or disease.
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a “Written Request,” relating to the use of the active moiety of the therapeutic candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines information relating to the use of a therapeutic candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original or New Drug Applications, or NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the therapeutic candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to 
possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. Our company cannot be certain it or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If our company or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA for the therapeutic product.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses not described in the product’s labeling and different from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
Healthcare Reform
In 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which we refer to as the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional policy reforms. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, and fraud and abuse, impacting existing government healthcare programs and resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives, and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. The Affordable Care Act also does, among other things, the following:
•Increases pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program due to an increase in the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs, and the application of Medicaid rebate liability to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans.
•Expands the 340B Drug Pricing Program to require discounts for “covered outpatient drugs” sold to certain children’s hospitals, critical access hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, rural referral centers, and sole community hospital.
•Requires pharmaceutical companies to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the “Donut Hole.”
•Requires pharmaceutical companies to pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on each company’s market share of prior year total sales of branded drugs to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense.
•Establishes the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
•Establishes the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the sale, marketing, coverage, and reimbursement of products regulated by the CMS or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, CMS regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways significantly affecting our business and our products.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, or healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in material adverse effect on our business.
Additionally, at the federal level, in 2020, the HHS and CMS issued various rules that are expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of the rules implemented during the Trump administration. As a result, the Biden administration and HHS have delayed the implementation or published rules rescinding some of these Trump-era policies. In January 2021, President Biden also issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for people to obtain health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, and instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, among others. Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. Additionally, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Although no legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles, Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases and allowing Medicare to negotiate pricing for certain drugs. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
Further, many states have proposed or enacted legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products candidates. We cannot be sure to what extent these and future legislative and regulatory efforts, whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate, if approved, is prescribed or used.
Furthermore, political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform health care coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative health care benefits, controls on health care spending, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for, or the amounts federal and state governments will pay for, health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures, and limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the federal Medicaid program, a program for financially needy patients, among others, requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients.
In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B, part of the federal Medicare program covering outpatient items and services for the aged and disabled, and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program, a federal program requiring manufacturers to provide discounts to certain safety-net providers. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based upon certain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program metrics reported by the manufacturer.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded product on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. However, under Medicare Part D - Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit - there are protections in place to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oncology products and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all anti-cancer agents. Furthermore, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product approved for sale, we may need to pursue compendia listings or conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other state and local government agencies.
If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing strategies. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws affecting our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
•federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government;
•provisions of HIPAA, prohibiting knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program and making false statements relating to health care matters;
•provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
•the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the Affordable Care Act, requiring applicable manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics, among other covered medical products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to track and report annually certain payments and other transfers of value they 
make to covered recipients, including U.S. physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, other health care professionals (such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, among others) and teaching hospitals, as defined by law, as well as physicians’ and physicians’ immediate family members’ ownership and investment interests in the applicable manufacturer, which are subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on the CMS Open Payments website; and
•state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides the government may assert a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the U.S. federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We may also be subject to additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement with a governmental entity to resolve allegations that we have violated these laws. To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
