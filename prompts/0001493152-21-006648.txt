ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We are a growth-oriented agricultural company that supports environmentally sustainable farming practices through the discovery, development and sale of innovative biological products for crop protection, crop health and crop nutrition. Our products are sold through distributors and other commercial partners to growers around the world for use in integrated pest management and crop protection systems that improve efficacy and increase yields and quality while protecting the environment. Our products are often used in conjunction with or as an alternative to other agricultural solutions to control pests and enhance plant nutrition and health.
 
Our portfolio of 15 products helps customers operate more sustainably while increasing their return on investment. Our products are used globally, and can be applied as foliar treatments or as seed-and-soil treatments, either on their own or in combination with other agricultural products. Our end markets include row crops, such as corn and soybeans, fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, leafy greens and cucurbits, trees, nuts and vines, such as almonds and grapes, and greenhouse production, such as ornamentals and medicinal plants.
 
Our research and development program uses proprietary technologies to isolate and screen naturally occurring microorganisms and plant extracts to create new, environmentally sound solutions in agriculture. Our research has resulted in novel biological products that help the grower:
 

● | Protect crops from diseases, insects and weeds; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------
● | Promote plant health and improve the soil microbiome; and 
● | Enhance a crop’s efficient use of nutrients. 

 
Our products are supported by a robust portfolio of more than 500 issued and pending patents worldwide. Our products are approved by federal and state government agencies for use in organic and/or conventional farming systems. Most of our products are produced or packaged at our dedicated, state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Bangor, Michigan. We also have a minority ownership in a third-party manufacturing facility in Vyborg, Russia.
 
Industry Overview
 
Biological agricultural products, or biologicals, include bioprotection products, biofertilizers (bionutrition) and biostimulants, and occupy a unique space in agriculture as emerging technologies that offer proven economic and environmental benefits to the consumer, the grower and the distributor.
 
For consumers, biologicals are part of the trend toward accessible, affordable, high-quality food produced in an environmentally sustainable manner. For growers and distributors, biologicals offer alternative solutions to farm in a way that not only enhances crop quality but also protects natural resources and reduces carbon footprint.
 
Farmers continually explore new options in crop production. Biologicals treatments give them innovative tools to increase yields and quality while protecting the safety of their operations and the health of their families, employees and land.
 
The global demand for alternative agricultural solutions drives the need for products that:
 

● | Increase yield and crop quality; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improve soil health and nutrient utilization; 
● | Benefit the soil microbiome; and 
● | Provide greater convenience and flexibility in growing practices. 

 
To meet these objectives, an increasing number of growers are implementing integrated pest management (“IPM”) programs. Growers use IPM to produce crops by the most economical means, and with the least possible hazard to people, property, and the environment. Biological agricultural products and crop cultivating techniques such as crop rotation and low-or-no tillage are among the most commonly used IPM practices.
 
The market for biological products is highly fragmented. There are around 300 known biopesticide active substances and organisms, and this high degree of fragmentation makes it difficult for the distribution channel and growers to differentiate between products and suppliers. Channel access favors those who can be long-term trusted partners consistently delivering products that provide the highest level of performance and return on investment.
 
Biologicals are developed and sold by two groups of agricultural companies. First, major, diversified agricultural suppliers who also sell seeds, fertilizers and chemical treatments for pest and weed control. Second, smaller companies dedicated primarily to research, development and commercialization of biologically based products.
 
We believe recent acquisitions or partnerships by major agricultural enterprises of biologicals companies signal a trend toward further consolidation, underscoring the value of the sector in the broader agricultural industry landscape.
 
Biologicals are delivering double-digit growth industrywide, as compared with low-single-digit growth for conventional crop protection products. We believe the market opportunity is significant: the market for agricultural biologicals, estimated to be more than $7 billion for 2019, still only represented less than 15% of the total crop protection market for the same year, according to market research firms MarketandMarkets and Phillips McDougal, respectively.

Our Competitive Advantages
 
We are the leading pure-play, public company in the agricultural biologicals space, with a track record of revenue growth and gross margin expansion. To establish a leadership position in the biologicals space, we have spent significant time and resources advancing our product lines, expanding our portfolio through internal development and acquisitions, and building our infrastructure, plant capacity and global footprint. Our competitive advantages include:
 
Breadth and depth of experience –We have been a pioneer in the field of agricultural biological solutions, and have a track record of serving a full range of specialty and row crops for growers using conventional, organic or regenerative farming practices.
 
Unparalled product portfolio – We offer products across all three categories of biologicals: crop protection, crop health and crop nutrition. With 15 products to offer, we have size and scale that give us relevance within the agricultural distribution network and pull-through demand from growers.
 
Global commercial reach – We have partnerships with more than 15 distributors in more than 20 countries, and sell our novel, efficacious products to growers worldwide. We are reaping the benefits of the relationships we have built with partners in key growing regions outside the United States. We are becoming a less U.S.-centric company, with the potential to expand significantly in the large growing regions in Latin America and the European Union. We are rapidly diversifying our global mix, with a target to have our sales closer to an equal split between North America and the rest of the world by 2023.
 
Rapid integration of strategic acquisitions – We made two strategic acquisitions in the second half of 2019: Pro Farm and the Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide product families. Both were rapidly integrated into our operations and were immediate contributors to revenue growth and margin expansion. Pro Farm afforded us rapid entry into the key row crop markets of Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and is central to our expansion in South America, including Brazil and Argentina. Aggressive field trial programs incorporating the Pro Farm crop nutrition products were conducted in 2020, often in combination with existing crop protection products in our historic portfolio. We anticipate the potential for further commercial synergies within distribution networks and product lines from this acquisition.
 
A robust, cost-efficient research and development pipeline – Our breakthrough research and development is based on a proprietary library of approximately 18,000 micro-organisms and 350 plant extracts. Our 10-year pipeline includes 20 potential product candidates, 7 of which are projected to launch through 2022. We are targeting approximately an additional $50 million in revenues from the launch of our pipeline products through 2026.
 
Speed to market – Discovery of new biologicals is cost effective: A new product can be brought to market at less than 5% of what it costs to develop a crop protection chemical, and in one-third of the time or less. We believe we have demonstrated our ability to develop and commercialize novel and effective products at commercially competitive rates and standards. We have continued to develop and refine these products, reducing manufacturing costs, producing new formulations, applying for expanded use labels and seeking new overseas markets, in each case at a cost of less than $11 million per product line.
 
Dedicated manufacturing capabilities – We operate two packaging and manufacturing facilities, one in Bangor, Michigan (Marrone Michigan Manufacturing, or MMM), and the other, a minority interest in third-party manufacturing in Vyborg, Russia. The MMM facility has made recent advances that have increased production yields and generally reduced cost of product revenues. This has been achieved through greater scale and improved utilization rates to increase volumes and yields while lowering overhead. The MMM manufacturing facility is preparing for an expansion that we believe will allow us to bring additional production in-house, improve gross margins and reduce working capital. We are currently investing more than $1 million in an upgrade of the facility with a projected two-year payback.
 
Regulatory expertise and patent positions – As an early developer of biological agricultural products, we have in-depth experience seeking approvals and registrations for our unique products in countries around the world. Our commercial efforts are supported by more than 500 issued and pending patents worldwide.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We have built a full-service biologicals organization with scope and capabilities across the spectrum of biological products in the market today. Our strategic objective is to capitalize on that position and emerge as a leader in the biologicals space with the financial and operational wherewithal to accelerate our path to profitability.

As we look forward, our goal is to leverage our base business, while accelerating our expansion plans and broadening our global reach. We are committed to launching the brand extensions and pipeline products that offer the greatest return on investment for our channel partners and grower customers. We anticipate that synergistic, value-creating acquisitions and partnerships will be part of our strategy. We believe we can continue to tuck in additional product lines as we build a larger commercial presence with a scalable platform.
 
Our success will be defined by:
 
The diversification of our portfolio, whether it be the products we sell, the crops we serve or the geographies we reach.
 

● | In 2019, our sales were roughly one-third biofungicides, one-third bioinsecticides and bionematicides, and one-third seed-and-soil treatments. Over the next three years, as sales grow, we are targeting a shift in product mix to seed-and-soil treatments at approximately 43% and plant health products at approximately 14%, while maintaining a strong position in crop protection products at approximately 43%. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Specialty crops were the foundation of our historical sales, but we also are making significant inroads into row crops, including soybeans and corn. We are targeting an increase in row crops to comprise half of our sales by 2023, up from roughly one-third of our applications mix in 2019. 
● | We are targeting roughly equal sales between North America and the rest of the world by 2023, which would be a major change from 2020 when more than 70% of our sales were in North America. 

 
Commercial launch of novel, efficacious agricultural biological products through investments in high-priority research and development projects that can accelerate the time to market and revenue contributions.
 

● | We believe our pipeline uniquely positions us as a leader in the research, development and commercialization of products within this rapidly growing sector of agriculture. We are focused on a robust set of options across the entire sector, and especially in the seed-and-soil treatment market. In addition, we have significant opportunity to build on our leadership position in bioprotection products, while making further inroads into major row crops globally. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have undertaken an in-depth review of our research and development pipeline to ensure it delivers the maximum value for all key stakeholders – including our grower customers, our distribution channel partners, and our stockholders. 
● | We believe this revamped research and development program is highly responsive to customer needs, while making the most efficient use of available resources to provide the greatest returns on investment. By our estimates, our pipeline has the potential to add approximately $50 million in incremental revenues in the 2026 timeframe, and over $100 million in incremental revenues by 2030. Near-term, we have identified 7 pipeline products that have a high-probability of reaching the market in 2021 and 2022. All are well understood in our pipeline and commercial portfolio, with clear lines of sight into addressable markets, crops and customer value propositions. 

 
Strategic, accretive acquisitions, as well as investments in partners with complementary technologies that would strengthen our pipeline or commercial offerings.
 
We have proactively identified the criteria for our acquisition strategy. Ideal candidates should generally have:
 

● | A proven portfolio of efficacious products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
● | A solid suite of intellectual property and protection; 
● | A track record of commercial success and growth; 
● | The potential for meaningful synergies and cost savings; and 
● | Accretion to earnings within 24 months. 

 
Any partnerships, mergers or acquisitions should immediately broaden our portfolio, as well as have the opportunity to explore new combinations between respective technologies and pipelines that will expand our ability to bring novel products to market through our distribution channel partners.

An unrelenting focus on being brilliant at the basics — driving operational and financial excellence, with a keen eye on net income, cash flow and a healthy balance sheet.
 

● | We believe we have reached a turning point in our evolution as a commercial provider of sustainable, biological solutions. With four years of revenue growth at a 28% compounded annual growth rate and an annual gross profit margin greater than 50%, we have established a commercial base from which we can accelerate our velocity and expand our leadership position in the space. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We are making progress on managing operating expenses relative to the growth of our revenues and gross profit. We will seek to maintain future operating expenses in line with 2020 levels, plus inflation. We believe this is a level of operating expenses that can still support our continued strong growth and accelerate our path to profitability. 
● | Warrant transactions in 2019 and early 2020 strengthened our balance sheet and reduced dilution in a cost effective manner to support our operational needs. 

Our Markets
 
Our biological product portfolio provides growers with comprehensive solutions from planting to harvest; increasing plant vigor and health; controlling pests and diseases; reducing crop stress; increasing yields; and improving plant nutrient use efficiency, all of which provide growers a better return on investment for their farming operations.
Biologicals Product Categories
 
Our product categories include products often referred to as biopesticides, bioinsecticides, bionematicides, biofungicides, biostimulants and bionutrition, among others.
 
Crop Protection: Our historical commercial strength has been in the crop protection arena – biological products that protect crops against fungus, insects and nematodes. These are either sprayed on the leaves of plants and trees at various points in the growing season, or used as seed- or soil-based treatments at planting. This is the heart of our portfolio, and we continue to leverage this leading position in the biological control market valued by market research firm DunhamTrimmer in their Global Biocontrol Report for 2019 at $3.8 billion globally. We have strengthened our competitive offerings through internal research that has resulted in next-generation advancements, as well as through the 2019 acquisition of the Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide fungicides, bactericides and disinfectants.
 
Crop Health: For 2019, bioinsecticides represented $1.8 billion of the global biological control market according to DunhamTrimmer. These products reduce plant stresses or enhance the crop’s tolerance to abiotic or external stresses, such as lack of water or excessive sunlight. This is a newer opportunity for us, and includes the 2021 launch of Pacesetter, a new product for plant health that is used in combination with conventional products to boost yields and improve the grower’s return on investment.
 
Crop Nutrition: Our 2019 acquisition of Pro Farm allowed us to establish a global presence in the rapidly expanding biofertilizers market segment estimated at $2.3 billion for 2020 by MarketsandMarkets in their agricultural biologicals report. Crop nutrition products encourage better uptake of vital nutrients that allow the plant to withstand stresses and increase output. With the acquisition of Pro Farm, we added proprietary nutrient and biostimulant technology and products for seed and foliar treatments. This portfolio of products uses a proprietary mode of action to stimulate plant growth and improve plant health, resulting in improved yields and crop quality.
 
Pro Farm’s proven technology is applied in seed and foliar treatments in the major row and specialty crops of corn, cereals, sunflowers, oilseed rape (canola), sugar beets and vegetables, with other crops in development. Pro Farm has distribution agreements servicing most of the major global agricultural production areas, with particular strength in Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and expansion under way in Latin America, North America, Africa and Asia.

Product Applications
 
Foliar Applications: Foliar applications treat the plant by spraying the leaves to protect against pests, reduce stress or encourage plant health and is a broadly used technique in agriculture. Many of our products can be used as foliar treatments in specialty crops – such as tomatoes, lettuces and melons – and in trees, nuts and vines – including almonds and grapes. Foliar applications also are commonly used in row crops and in greenhouse settings.
 
Seed and Soil Applications: The seed and soil treatment side of our business has created the most significant change in our product mix. A strategic collaboration established in 2016 with a major U.S. distributor created the first combination of our products in a seed treatment platform for row crops. Seed treatments provide insurance for growers, as they proactively respond to abiotic (external, environmental) and biotic (living organisms) stresses that are present at the time of planting, informed by grower experience and known growing conditions. Performance, usage rates, price and compatibility all come into the buying decision. All else being equal, we believe distributors, seed companies and growers will continue to opt for biological treatments. We project that our seed and soil treatments could grow to 45% of our portfolio over the next three years.
 
BioUnite: The BioUnite strategy – which combines the power of biology with the performance of chemistry – remains a cornerstone of our ability to expand in new and existing markets. The BioUnite program provides growers with specific biological prescriptions for tank mixes of novel biological solutions with standard crop protection offerings. BioUnite is a powerful alternative in a grower’s integrated pest management program that eliminates guesswork, enhances performance and yields, and thus increases the grower’s return on investment. This proven approach has been tested over the past five years, in more than 200 trials for efficiency, safety, affordability and sustainability.
 
New partnerships will allow us to continue to expand our BioUnite offerings globally. We announced an agreement in 2020 with Vive Crop Protection, a leader in precision chemistry solutions and owner of the patented Allosperse® technology. We believe this partnership will provide a suite of ground-breaking products for U.S. growers by combining one of our leading biologicals with proven conventional chemistry using Vive’s Allosperse Delivery System.
 
Our Products 
 
The table below summarizes our current portfolio of commercially available product lines. On average, our bioprotection products progress through discovery, development, regulatory approvals, and market launch domestically and internationally within five years or less at a cost generally less than $11.0 million. We have continued to develop and refine these products, resulting in new formulations, expanded-use labels, and new markets.
 
All available formulations, with the exception of our Pro Farm product lines and Haven, are compliant with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program and certified by the Organic Materials Research Institute (“OMRI”). All of our products have a low-risk profile as they are exempt from food tolerance requirements (that is, there are no pesticide residue concerns), and have an excellent safety profile for workers and consumers. For growers and others whose who work on farms, our products require minimal personal protective equipment (“PPE”), and allow workers to re-enter treated areas within four-hours of application, and with zero-day pre-harvest intervals. Our products also are low risk to pollinators, beneficial insects and other non-target organisms. In addition, our nutritional products create conditions for improved soil microbiome and enhance the plant’s efficient use of water and nutrients.

● | Bioherbicide: MBI-015 

 
The bioprotection product category is comprised of a wide spectrum of products – including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides – targeted for mid- to long-term market launches. These products advance our current commercial products and build on our unique understanding of and experience with agricultural biologicals from both a scientific and commercial perspective. These products address some of the most significant and challenging unmet market needs, including weed control, pest resistance management, or integrated pest management practices.
 
Greater penetration in existing markets and expansion to new markets – such as row crops – and uses – such as seed treatments – are the key commercial objectives for these products:
 

● | MBI-206 G2 is the advanced version of Venerate. Our 2020 field research established targeted reduction of product usage from current 64 fl. oz./acre to a significantly lower 5 10 fl. oz./acre, a roughly tenfold reduction in rate of application with comparable efficacy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Grandevo XC is the liquid version of the existing dry Grandevo product with better customer acceptance and improved field efficacy. 
● | MBI-015 is a post-emergence herbicide (sprayed on the weeds after they emerge) for use against a range of weeds, including palmer amaranth and water hemp, that are developing resistance to leading conventional chemical herbicide. MBI-015 is extension of MBI-014 and is targeted for use in conventional row crops. 

Seed and Soil: 
 

● | Seed : MBI-306 ST, MBI-307, MBI-5P16 
--+-----------------------------------------------
● | Soil: MBI-305 G2, MBI-306 Premix, MBI-601, 

 
This is the highest growth category in our pipeline, and builds on our strengths in biological crop protection and fertilizer. The majority of these products are targeted for use worldwide in row crops, such as corn, soybeans, rice and cereals, and in such high-value crops as tree nuts, grapes and leafy vegetable.

A key product for crop protection is MBI-306 and its variants (MBI-305 G2, MBI-306 Premix and MBI-307). MBI-306 is an enhanced version of our current seed and soil applied product, and significantly improves the level of efficacy against target pests. Based on our 2020 field research, we are targeting six-fold reduction in the amount of seed treatment applied, which is a competitive rate compared with to conventional treatments. For soil uses, such as in-furrow applications, our 2020 field research also supports a targeted six-fold reduction in rate of application, while providing the same control of corn rootworms, wireworms, lesion nematodes and seed corn maggots. Our ability to provide additional insect control coupled with nematode control gives us greater access to the corn, soybean and cotton soil-applied in-furrow markets. MBI-306 requires a new submission to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). We are currently concluding our toxicology studies, fermentation and formulation work in order to prepare for the new submission.
 
Our pipeline of novel seed applied plant nutrition products that are designed for industrial seed treatment but can also be used in downstream seed treatment include: New breakthrough formulations with UBP-technology, out of which MBI-5P16 is the first one to be introduced to the market for row crops (corn, soybeans and OSR) in the United States and EU. Most of these products are also in compliance with new harmonized EU Biostimulant regulation scheduled for 2022 (European parliament, Regulation (EC) No. 2019/1009), which will allow for pan-European market access for our plant health products.

● | We have partnered with Vive Crop Protection to combine Regalia with proven conventional chemistry (azoxystrobin) using Vive’s unique Allosperse Delivery System. The combination product Reyzox will be targeted to the fruits and vegetables market. 
● | Ympact is a unique plant health product designed for cereals as a seed treatment Optima is a second-generation product, optimized product for hybrid crops. 
● | Takla is a specialty seed treatment product under development for severe and specific conditions for the European market. Most of these products are scheduled for short-term market entry. 

 
We are continually investigating new research and development pipeline projects, whether through internal product development, in collaboration with other companies, or as a new product concept. We have established a stage gate process to evaluate and further advance our research and development pipeline. Overall, we estimate the current pipeline will add incremental risk – adjusted revenue growth of approximately $50 million in the long-term timeframe and approximately $100 million by 2030.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
In the United States, we sell our products through our internal sales force, which consists of 29 employees focused on managing distributor relationships and creating grower demand for our products. In addition, a dedicated team of 8 employees provide technical service support to both our customers and sales representatives on the use of our products in IPM and crop production programs, both for conventional growers as well as for an expanding number of organic growers. Our sales force covers all major regions in the United States, including California and the Pacific Northwest, the Southeast, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and the Great Lakes regions, with an emphasis on high-value specialty crops (fruits, nuts and vegetables). We currently sell our crop protection product lines through leading agricultural distributors, such as Albaugh, Aligned Ag, Helena Chemical, Nutrien Ag, Simplot, and Wilbur Ellis. These are the same distribution partners that most major agrichemical companies use for delivering solutions to growers across the country.

We sell our Foramin and UBP products through selected distributors in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In 2020 Pro Farm entered into a distribution agreement with PGG Wrightson Seed for Pro Farm seed treatment in Uruguay. Pro Farm is also working with numerous companies to improve its biological offerings, such Rizobacter in South America and Ruchi Hi Rich in India. With Pro Farm, we expect to expand our global distribution network. We are hiring sales managers for our Pro Farm products in key territories to help achieve our growth goals and provide support to our seed and distribution customers.
 
With respect to sales of Marrone products outside of the United States, we have exclusive legacy international distribution agreements with major international distributors such as FMC (for certain markets in Latin America) and Syngenta (for specialty crop markets in Europe). Our current strategy is to work with regional distributors and distributors in key countries who have brand recognition, established customer bases, who can effectively conduct field trials and grower demonstrations with biopesticides and lead or assist in regulatory processes and market development. As such, we have signed a number of distribution agreements with: Agristar, Nufarm, Jocanima, Elephant Vert and Kenya Biologics, Hoptri, Lidorr, AMC/Agrimatco, Disagro and Kyung Nong Corporation.
 
We believe we can leverage our existing sales, marketing and distribution network, finding synergies between operations for our products, to bring in additional revenues, while enhancing our overall product portfolio.
 
We derived approximately 85% and 91% of our total revenues from Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate and UBP ST product families for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of distributors for a significant portion of our revenues since we sell through highly concentrated, traditional distribution channels. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top three distributors accounted for 48% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 77% of our business was from the U.S. markets. In 2021, however, we expect our product mix to shift significantly due to both sales generated through our Pro Farm subsidiary, sales of our Pro Farm products and continued progress on registrations of our collective product lines in new countries.
 
While the biopesticide industry has been growing, customers in the crop production sectors often require on-farm demonstrations of pest management or plant health products, and based on their novel modes of action compared to chemical products, require education on their use. We are implementing the following strategies to accelerate adoption rates and promote sales of our biological pest management and plant health products:
 
Maintain a focused and effective sales and marketing team that shares our values. We believe after several years of investment we have been able to build an improved sales and marketing team. In addition, we are now more effectively organizing the data and educational material that we have amassed over years of operations on our bio-based products as well as organic and sustainable agricultural practices in order to train and equip our sales staff to communicate and educate distributors and growers. We believe that hiring and training sales and marketing staff with a high level of technical expertise and knowledge regarding the capabilities of our bio-based products, and unwavering belief in the potential and value of biologicals for crop production, is essential to expanding adoption of our products by growers and sales to distributors. In addition, we have invested in our field development team to include more technical service activities to support sales. These concerted efforts to build and train our sales and marketing teams are yielding positive results, including growth in sales.
 
Develop an extensive demonstration program. We believe that for growers to be convinced that a biological pest management, plant nutrition or plant health product work, they often must see it for themselves. Growers risk their crop each time they try a new product, and often produce only one crop per year on any given plot of land. Further, bio-based pesticide and plant health products are often applied differently and at different times than conventional chemical products and so may be used incorrectly by an inexperienced grower or advisor, decreasing efficacy. We typically conduct on-farm demonstrations with growers in the first year of association, a grower will then in the second year, try one of our products on smaller plots of land and on one crop to ensure successful application, and then progress continued use of our products in future years across more acres, more crops and more products from our product portfolio. In addition, we work with distributors to determine which crops to emphasize in a given year and which area to maximize the effectiveness of our demonstration program.

Target early adopters of new pest management technologies. For our biological pest management, plant nutrition and plant health products, we target both distributors and growers, who generally set industry standards through more widespread adoption of new pest management technologies they initially test on smaller portions of their crops. We also target organic growers, who are more willing to take risks on new products as they have had few alternatives and great demand for increased yields. We plan to continue to recruit these growers and their consultants to participate in demonstrations and field trials, enabling them to become familiar with our biological pest management and plant health products, to experience their benefits firsthand and to promote the use of our products with other growers in their regions.
 
Educate growers about the benefits of our biological pest management products. Education is critical to best use of biologicals, which often have different modes of action than chemical products. We will continue to perform on-farm demonstrations and provide field data packages to support and validate our product claims. We will also continue to participate in trade shows and conferences to educate growers and their licensed pest control advisors about the benefits of our biological pest management, plant nutrition and plant health products. We have provided instructional videos, blogposts, webinars, podcasts, teach-ins, by-line articles and an online course on biological pest management products, which can be taken by growers for continuing education credit to maintain crop protection product applicator licenses.
 
Develop and leverage relationships with key industry influencers. We will continue to develop relationships early in the product development process with influential members within our target markets, including large innovative growers, technical experts at leading agricultural universities, licensed pest control advisors, wineries, food processors, produce packers, and retailers. We believe that educating industry influencers about the benefits of biologicals and our products increases the likelihood that they will recommend our products to our distributors and end users. In addition, food companies and retailers are driven by consumers to require more sustainability and transparency from their grower-suppliers. This consumer-pushed trend is driving awareness with both the grower and food channel of the benefits of biologicals to soil health, the new movements in regenerative agriculture and sustainable crop production programs in general.
 
Leverage the synergies of our sales teams and businesses domestically and internationally. Because of the concentration of large growers in the United States, we can access these customers through our own sales force. For our specialty crop products and seed treatments we have distribution agreements with national and regional distributors in North America, Europe, Uruguay and Latin America. We believe we can leverage these existing relationships to expand sales of our Foramin and UBP product lines through our U.S.-based sales team and distributors and likewise expand sales of our legacy Marrone products through existing Pro Farm product distributors. For future products, distribution agreements will be developed with regional and national distributors or large multinationals on a case-by-case basis, depending on their expertise in the regions. For the fast-growing medicinal plant and hemp market, we have set up several specialty distributors who can benefit from our products. 
 
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing processes for our Marrone products are developed in-house at our Davis, California research and development facilities and transferred to our Bangor, Michigan facility, or to our manufacturing partners. Biopesticide formulation, microbial fermentation and product packaging are among the facility’s core competencies. We believe in-house manufacturing enhances control and flexibility in production, ensuring quality, strengthening intellectual property security and lowered manufacturing costs over time to achieve desired margins. The facility has room for expansion to install larger drying capacity and fermenters to accommodate production of multiple products at significantly higher volumes. In 2018 we purchased a packaging line, which was placed into service in the first half of 2018 and in 2021, we expect to invest approximately $1 million to be able to achieve increased in-house manufacturing of our products.
 
We currently ferment our Grandevo product in our manufacturing facility but continue to use a third-party contractor for formulating it into spray-dried powder. The facility also accommodates full-scale production of Regalia. While we have the ability to produce the majority of our products using our own manufacturing capacity, we currently use third parties to manufacture Venerate and Majestene/Zelto as a result of regulatory requirements for the microorganism that underlies their technology. In 2020, we secured the necessary federal and state approvals to begin Burkholderia rinojenis production at our Michigan facility. Stargus/Amplitude is also made at a third-party vendor because the Bacillus bacteria produce spores that are hard to contain and could pose contamination risks in the manufacturing of our other products. We intend to have fermentation of Bacillus at our facility but will require a separate facility from our other products. Haven has been produced using a third party, however recently we successfully validated the production at our Michigan facility and plan to bring the manufacturing of the product in-house. We anticipate ramping up production volumes as we expand the facility in the future. We expect to continue to utilize third-party manufactures in North America and the EU for supplemental production capacity to meet excess seasonal demand. As needed, we will also use our own facility or third parties to package and label products.

The active ingredient in our Regalia product line is derived from the giant knotweed plant, which is a food and medicinal plant native to China and Japan. We have scaled production of Regalia using a reliable, single supplier that acquires raw knotweed from numerous regional sources and performs an extraction process on this plant, following our specification. The resulting dried extract is shipped to our manufacturing plant for formulations, production and packaging. We do not maintain a long-term supply contract with this supplier, but we have worked with them for ten years. While there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain dried giant knotweed plant extract from our supplier in China at a competitive price point, we estimate that our current supply of the ingredient will be sufficient to manufacture product to meet the next 10 to 12 months’ demand. Should we elect or be required to do so, we have identified and received quality knotweed from a number of possible alternative suppliers, including one from outside China in the event additional inventory or diversified sourcing is necessary.
 
A majority of the production of our Pro Farm product lines, as well as associated raw materials, is conducted at a third-party manufacturing facility in Russia in which we have a 12% ownership stake. A large-scale paper and pulp manufacturing site in close proximity to this plant is the main supplier of the wood waste by-product material we use in production. For our Pro Farm products we take source custom made bespoke micronutrient mixes formulations from a European third-party supplier and have multiple third-party postproduction facilities in Europe. Our Jet products are manufactured by a third party located in the United States.
 
Research and Development
 
We have leveraged an innovative and market-focused discovery process to generate a robust product line and pipeline. This has included isolating approximately 18,000 microorganisms, testing more than 16,000 of them against multiple pest targets and testing a subset of them for plant health and nutrient uptake enhancement. We have then developed more than one product line based on the same active technology. Developing multiple products based on the same microbe allows for a more efficient use of research, development and manufacturing resources and enables us to leverage capital invested in existing technologies.
 
At this time, we are prioritizing our research and development on supporting our existing products and focusing on our pipeline projects as discussed above. These pipeline products combine our legacy and acquired collective technologies and are targeted for broader categories or bioprotection, plant health and seed and soil health.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 50 full-time equivalent employees dedicated to research and development and patent related activities, 7 of whom hold Ph.D. degrees or doctorates, plus 8 field development personnel who focus on technical support and demonstration and research field trials. Our research and development team has technical expertise in microbiology, molecular biology, natural product, formulation and analytical chemistry, biochemistry, fermentation, entomology, nematology, weed science, plant physiology, plant pathology. Our research and development activities include discovery, product development, product support, regulatory, patent and field trial activities, which are principally conducted at our Davis, California facility as well as by our field development specialists on crops in their respective regions. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in research and development such as increasing the number and locations of field trials and toxicology and regulatory consultants for new products and international expansion, but our Davis research and development headcount has remained relatively flat for several years. Our research and development expenses, including patent, regulatory and field trial expenses, were $11.3 million and $14.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Intellectual Property Rights
 
We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to preserve our competitive position. As of December 31, 2020, we had 60 issued U.S. patents and 421 issued foreign patents 17 pending U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, and 93 pending foreign patent applications relating to microorganisms and natural product compounds, uses and related technologies. As of December 31, 2020, we have received 8 copyright registrations. As of December 31, 2020, we had received 25 U.S. trademark registrations and had 25 trademark applications pending in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we also had received 167 trademark registrations and had 41 trademark applications pending in various other countries.
 
When we find a microbial product in our screen that kills or inhibits one or more pests or pathogens in at least three replicated tests and identify the microorganism and its associated chemistry, we file a patent application claiming any one or more of the following:
 

● | the microorganism, its DNA products, as well as mutations and other derivatives; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the use of the microorganism for pest management; 
● | novel natural product compounds, their analogs and unique mixtures of compounds produced by the microorganism; 
● | the new use of known natural product compounds for pest management; 
● | formulations of the microorganism or compounds; and 
● | synergistic mixtures of the microorganism or compounds with conventional chemical or other pesticides. 

 
One of our commercially available products and certain of our lead product candidates are based on microbes we have identified using our proprietary discovery process, including Venerate, Majestene/Zelto and MBI-015, which are based on a Burkholderia bacterium, with respect to which we have 58 issued patents and 16 pending patent applications (both U.S. and foreign), and MBI-110, which are based on a Bacillus strain, with respect to which we have 29 issued patents and 3 pending patent applications (both U.S. and foreign). Foramin and UBP products are based on technology developed by Pro Farm scientists for producing organic molecular complexes that facilitate nutrient absorption, and are protected by 3 issued U.S. patents, one issued Canadian patent, and 14 pending patent applications (both U.S. and foreign) comprising issued method of use patents and pending applications for method of manufacture.
 
We have also entered into in-license and research and development agreements with respect to the use and commercialization of Grandevo and Haven, as well as certain products under development. Under the licensing arrangements for our commercially available products, we are obligated to pay royalty fees in the mid-single digit of net sales of these products. The exclusivity and royalty provisions of these agreements are generally tied to the expiration of underlying patents. In addition, the in-licensed U.S. patent for Grandevo is expected to expire in or around 2024, but we have issued U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications relating to Grandevo that could expire later than 2024, and we have also filed separate patent applications for Grandevo of which 11 have been issued in the U.S. on a novel compound and insecticidal uses for nematodes, corn rootworm and a variety of insects, as well as new formulations and other uses. Additionally, we have filed separate patent applications with respect to Regalia and have been issued 6 U.S. patents.
 
While third parties thereafter may develop products using the technology under the expired patents, we do not believe that they can produce competitive products without infringing other aspects of our proprietary technology, and we therefore do not expect the expiration of the patents or the related exclusivity obligations to have a significant adverse financial or operational impact on our business.
 
Regulatory Considerations
 
Our activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations. These regulations may prevent us or our collaborators from developing or commercializing products in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions and may impose expenses, delays and other impediments to our product development and registration efforts. In the United States, the EPA regulates our bio-based pest management products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (“FFDCA”) and the Food Quality Protection Act (“FQPA”). In addition, some of our plant health products are regulated as fertilizers, auxiliary plant substances, soil amendments, beneficial substances and/or biostimulants in each of the fifty states.

In 2004, the United States Congress passed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act, which was reauthorized in 2007 and 2012, a result of efforts from an industry coalition of pesticide companies and environmental groups, to codify pesticide approval times in return for user fees. This law facilitates faster approval times for biopesticides, with EPA approvals typically received within 16 to 24 months, compared with 36 months or longer for conventional chemical pesticides. Registration processes for state and foreign governments vary between jurisdictions and can take up to 12 months for state governments, such as California and New York, and up to 36 months or more for foreign governments. In some instances, California and Canada will conduct joint reviews with the EPA, which allows some pesticides to receive concurrent approvals in California, Canada and the United States. However, in most instances, most foreign government submissions will not occur until after a U.S. registration has been secured. To register a crop protection product with the EPA, companies must demonstrate the product is safe to mammals, non-target organisms, endangered species and the environment. To demonstrate the biological pest management product’s safety, required studies must be conducted that evaluate mammalian toxicology, toxicological effects to non-target organisms in the environment (ecotoxicological exposures) and physical and chemical properties of the product. The registration dossier is subject to both scientific and administrative reviews by EPA scientists and management before registration approval. The scientific review involves thorough evaluation of submitted data and completion of risk assessments for human dietary and ecotoxicological exposures. Upon completion of this process, the registration package, including the proposed label, is sent to the Office of General Council for legal review. The final step in the registration process is administrative sign-off by the EPA director of the Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division.
 
In addition to EPA approval, we are required to obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate state regulatory authority in individual states and foreign regulatory authorities before we can market or sell any pest management product in those jurisdictions. Foreign governments typically require up to two seasons of locally generated field efficacy data on crop-pest combinations before a product dossier can be submitted for review. California and foreign jurisdictions also require us to submit product efficacy data, which the EPA historically has not required, but may request.
 
We also generally pursue organic certification, including USDA National Organic Program, Organic Materials Review Institute (“OMRI”), EcoCert and Control Union, for our product portfolio. These certifications often entail a two to four-month review process and, in many instances, require annual or semi-annual audits.
 
While these regulations substantially increase the time and cost associated with bringing our products to market, we believe that our management team’s significant experience in bringing our and other companies’ technologies through EPA, state and foreign regulatory approval, efficient development process and ability to leverage our strategic collaborations to assist with registrations, particularly in Europe and Latin America, have and will continue to enable us to overcome these challenges.
 
Around the globe, the regulatory process for biostimulants and bionutrients (biofertilizers) is significantly accelerated compared to that for biopesticides. In the United States, if plant health products are not used to control pests or do not act as plant (growth) regulators, they currently fall outside the legal scope of FIFRA, FFDCA and FQPA and, therefore, we do not need to submit applications for EPA registrations for such products. However, we must still submit state registrations for our plant health products, including Haven and our Pro Farm products. Products containing microbes of foreign origin may also need to be “deregulated” (or determined not to be a plant pest) under the Plant Protection Act by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service prior to use in field trials or for large scale release. Europe and the United States have industry coalitions that have developed more formal definitions of “biostimulant” and made recommendations for possible streamlined regulatory frameworks. The 2018 Farm Bill for the first time proposed a federal definition of biostimulants. As mandated by U. S. Congress in the 2018 Farm Bill, in December 2019, the Secretary of Agriculture submitted a study to Congress recommending options for the official definition and regulation of biostimulants in the United States. Joint federal, state and industry discussions are now underway to review those options and to recommend a suitable path forward and policy framework for the regulation of biostimulants in the United States.

All of our biopesticide product lines are EPA-approved. However, as with any pesticide, our pest management products will continue to be subject to review by the EPA and state regulatory agencies. The EPA has the authority to revoke the registration or impose limitations on the use of any of our pest management products if we do not comply with the regulatory requirements, if unexpected problems occur with a product or if the EPA receives other newly discovered adverse information. See Part I-Item 1A-”Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Strategy—Our inability to obtain regulatory approvals, or to comply with ongoing and changing regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent sales of the products we are developing and commercializing.” Our research and development activities are also subject to federal, state and local worker safety, air pollution, water pollution and solid and hazardous waste regulatory programs and periodic inspection. We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulatory requirements.
 
Competition
 
For agricultural products, performance and value are critical competitive factors. To compete against manufacturers of conventional chemical pesticides, chemical fertilizers and genetically modified crops, we need to demonstrate the advantages of our products over these more established products. Many large agrichemical companies are developing, and have introduced, new conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified products that they believe are safer and more environmentally friendly than older conventional chemical products.
 
The pest management market is very competitive and is dominated by multinational chemical and life sciences companies such as Syngenta Crop Protection, Bayer Crop Science, BASF, Corteva Agriscience, UPL, FMC and Sumitomo Corporation. Additionally, universities, research institutes and government agencies may also conduct research, seek patent protection and, through collaborations, develop competitive pest management products. Other companies, including bio-specialized biopesticide businesses such as Certis USA (owned by Mitsui & Co), Novozymes and Valent Biosciences (subsidiary of Sumitomo Chemical) may prove to be significant competitors in the biological pest management and plant health market. Due to the lower regulatory barriers than for crop protection products, the market for bionutrition and biostimulant products is very fragmented and includes larger players like Valagro (recently acquired by Syngenta Crop Protection), UPL and Acadian Seaplants and startups such as Indigo, Bioconsortia, New Leaf Symbiotics and Pivot Bio.
 
In many instances, agrichemical companies have substantially greater financial, technical, development, distribution and sales and marketing resources than we do. Moreover, these companies may have greater brand recognition and may offer greater discounts as a competitive tactic. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing pest management products that are more effective or less expensive than our products or that would render our products obsolete or less competitive. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies and products.
 
Environmental Social and Governance 
 
In our actions and engagement with stakeholders, we are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen. We aim to be a leader in the movement toward a more sustainable world through the discovery, development and promotion of biological solutions for pest management and plant health. We operate our business with a consistent focus on protecting the environment, safeguarding the health and safety of our employees, supporting our local communities, and operating with ethics and integrity. As reflected in our values, we are committed to aligning with environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) best practices and standards:.

● | We believe in sustainable business practices – that are economically viable, socially equitable and environmentally responsible. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We strive to conduct all business dealings with integrity, treating all stakeholders, collaborators and trade partners with respect, fairness and honesty at all times, and we expect the same in return. 
● | We promote a culture of accountability, continuous learning, diversity to bring about better decision-making.

We believe the environmental benefits of our products and our promotion of environmental stewardship, social responsibility and good governance through our leadership in the sustainable agriculture movement puts us in a strong market position as customers, strategic partners, investors and other stakeholders continue to assess ESG factors in their decision making.
 
Environmental
 
Our business revolves around producing environmentally responsible products for pest management, plant nutrition and plant health. All of our product families for crop protection are EPA-registered as biopesticides and our biological products enable customers to mitigate environmental concerns associated with conventional chemical pesticide products.
 
In general, our products are:
 

● | Fermented microbes or extracted from plants (knotweed and coconuts) and use agricultural or other biological raw materials in these fermentation or plant extraction processes, resulting in lower fossil fuel usage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Assessed by the U.S. EPA, and other regulators, as having the lowest pesticide residue risk levels for pesticidal products, known legally as being “exempt from the requirement of a food tolerance.” 
● | Lower risk to pollinators and other non-target organisms. 
● | Biodegradable, breaking down quickly into carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. 
● | Designed to increase soil health by supporting or increasing microbial diversity in the soil. 

 
We are also proud of the results of a study we conducted in cooperation with the UC-Davis Graduate School of Management showing that switching from conventional chemical pesticide products to our Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate and Majestene product lines could, potentially, result in average net reductions of greenhouse gas emissions of 69% to 91% (or 39 to 46 kilograms of CO2 equivalents per acre per year).
 
Social
 
Ensuring the safety, health and well-being of our employees, growers and farm workers and the public at large is central to our vision for our business. Within our workplace, safety is both an individual and shared responsibility including periodic internal safety audits and safety trainings. In the wake of COVID-19 we have implemented the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines including masks and social distancing at both our corporate headquarters and our manufacturing plant, restricting all commercial travel by employees, requiring daily temperature checks, scaling down our operations including at our manufacturing plant, and frequent communications of our safety plans in light of COVID-19. We take a holistic approach to employee health and well-being by offering wellness programs that promote and incentivize healthy habits, such as physical fitness, smoking cessation and weight loss.
 
We are also proud to support employees at all levels who are interested in making a difference in their local communities through nonprofit board service, donations and volunteer time. Our recent and current partnerships and projects include:
 

● | Partnering with the fire department, high school science department and various community nonprofits in Bangor, Michigan, where our manufacturing facility is located; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Governance and Ethics
 
Our board of directors has direct oversight of our ESG strategy, which is implemented internally by our cross-functional ESG steering committee led by the Company’s Chief Sustainability Officer, who also serves as our Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Government Affairs. Four of our eight directors possess directly relevant sustainability experience, including two directors with large-farm experience. For example, Dr. Pam Marrone, a member of our Board of Directors and our founder, received the Steward of Sustainable Agriculture Award by the Ecological Farming Association in January 2019 in recognition of her long-term, significant contributions to the well-being of agriculture and the planet.
 
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics promotes honest and ethical conduct; full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosures; compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; protection of Company assets; fair dealing practices; prompt reporting of Code violations to the appropriate person; and accountability for adherence to the Code. All employees are required to acknowledge our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which we make publicly available on our company website along with our Whistleblower Policy and Board of Directors Committee Charters. Finally, we adhere to the governance requirements established by federal and state law, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq.
 
Human Capital
 
Our support of our employees extends to ensuring they are compensated fairly for their work. We believe we provide employees with a competitive and comprehensive pay and benefits package including both cash and non-cash compensation, health benefits and paid time off to name a few. Our commitment to pay equity is shared by Company leaders. For example, the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other senior managers is generally less than 10 times that of our lowest-paid full-time employee.
 
We believe our human capital is one of our many great assets, so strive for a workplace that realizes the potential of our people: 
 

● | We believe entrepreneurial attitudes, agility, and out of the box thinking and creativity are the lifeblood of innovation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We demand open and honest communication and respect for the views of others, and seek to minimize internal politics and value the input of all employees in the Company’s strategy, goal setting and decision-making. 
● | We believe that a diverse workforce, with diverse opinions, working together in teams leads to better decision-making and actively try to enhance diversity in our workforce. 
● | We promote a culture of accountability, continuous learning, coaching, and mentoring for personal and professional growth. 

 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 145 full-time equivalent employees, of whom 15 hold Ph.D. degrees or doctorates. Approximately 50 employees are engaged in research and development and patent related activities, 30 in sales and marketing (including 8 sales and field development personnel who focus on technical support and demonstration and research field trials), 36 in operations, including manufacturing, supply chain and quality assurance, and 30 in management, accounting/finance and administration.
 
We take pride in the diversity of our workforce and being an equal opportunity provider. As a growing company focused on innovation, we strive to foster diversity and inclusion, with women representing approximately 49% of all employees (and 22% of senior management and 59% of our research and development team) and racial or ethnic minorities representing approximately 42% of employees (and 33% of senior management).
