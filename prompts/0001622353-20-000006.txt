 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 General
 We are a commercial real estate company that invests primarily in new or recently-constructed and opened self-storage facilities located predominately in dense urban submarkets within the top 50 United States metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”). Facilities in which we invest are largely vertical (three to ten floors), 100% climate controlled and technologically adapted buildings, which we call Generation V facilities. These facilities are located in submarkets with demographic profiles and competitive positions that management believes will support successful lease-up of such facilities and value creation for our stockholders. Our investments include wholly-owned self-storage facilities as well as mortgage loans typically coupled with equity interests.
 Our principal business objective is to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in new Generation V self-storage facilities primarily in urban submarkets. A majority of our investments to date have been first mortgage loans to finance ground-up construction of and conversion of existing buildings into new Generation V self-storage facilities. These investments, which we refer to as “development property investments,” are typically structured as loans equal to between 90% and 97% of facility costs (including land, pre-development and other “soft” costs, hard construction costs, fees and interest and operating reserves). We receive a fixed rate of interest on loaned amounts and up to a 49.9% interest in the positive cash flows from operations, sales and/or refinancings of self-storage facilities, which we refer to as “Profits Interest”. We also typically receive a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) to acquire the self-storage facility upon sale.
 Additionally, in March 2018 we closed a bridge financing investment consisting of five separate loans with an aggregate commitment amount of $83.3 million secured by first mortgages with equity participations and ROFRs on five self-storage properties in the Miami, Florida MSA that are in lease-up. We refer to this investment herein as a “Bridge Investment.” On September 17, 2019, we acquired 100% of the membership interests in the limited liability companies that own the underlying self-storage facilities of these Bridge Investments, and we now wholly own and consolidate these properties in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and no longer have any bridge investments outstanding. 
     Our primary strategy moving forward is to continue to acquire 100% ownership of a majority of the self-storage facilities that we have financed either through the exercise of ROFRs or through privately negotiated transactions with our investment counterparties, subject to acquisition prices being consistent with our investment objective to create long-term value for our stockholders. As of December 31, 2019, we owned 100% of the membership interests in the LLCs that own fifteen facilities and fully consolidate these facilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we acquired 100% of the membership interests in the LLCs that own nine additional self-storage facilities.
     We account for our development property investments and bridge investments (prior to the acquisition discussed above) at fair value, with appreciation and depreciation in the value of these investments being reflected in the carrying value of the assets and in the determination of net income. In determining fair value, we re-value each development property investment and bridge investment each quarter, which re-valuation includes an analysis of the current value of any Profits Interest associated with the investment. We believe that carrying our assets at fair value and reflecting appreciation and depreciation in our earnings provide our stockholders and others who rely on our financial statements with a more complete and accurate understanding of our financial condition and economic performance, including revenues and the creation of value through our Profits Interests as self-storage facilities we finance are constructed, leased-up and become stabilized.
     We have historically funded our on-balance sheet investments with (i) proceeds from sales of our securities, including sales of our common stock in follow-on offerings and pursuant to our common stock at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”), (ii) funds from secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility with KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc., as lead arranger and the other lenders party thereto (the “Credit Facility”) and term loans on individual properties, and (iii) net proceeds from the monetization of existing development property investments. We have also used proceeds from the sale of senior participations and the sale of our Series A 

 
  4
 
Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between us and funds managed by Highland Capital Management, L.P., pursuant to which we issued $125 million of Series A Preferred Stock and the sale of our Series B Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC registering the future sale from time to time of up to $500.0 million of our securities. We have an ATM Program pursuant to which we may issue up to $100 million in shares of our common stock. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have approximately $80.9 million available for issuance under our ATM Program. As of December 31, 2019, we have remaining unfunded commitments under our development investments of approximately $136.1 million, including non-cash interest reserves of approximately $30.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, we have $3.3 million of cash on hand and $73.0 million of remaining capacity under our Credit Facility, assuming we are able to access the full borrowing base availability. In addition, we have a $165.0 million accordion feature under our Credit Facility, which is subject to various conditions, including obtaining commitments from lenders for the additional amounts. We may also use any combination of the following additional capital sources to fund capital needs:
    
· | Refinancing of JCAP mortgage indebtedness (49.9% profits interest and ROFR retained),
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potential sales of facilities underlying current development investments to a third party, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Additional common stock issuances.
--+-----------------------------------

      However, we can provide no assurances that we will have access to all of the sources noted above. 
     On March 7, 2016, we, through our Operating Company, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) of Storage Lenders LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, to form a real estate venture (the “SL1 Venture”) with HVP III Storage Lenders Investor, LLC (“HVP III”), an investment vehicle managed by Heitman Capital Management LLC (“Heitman”). The SL1 Venture was formed for the purpose of providing capital to developers of self-storage facilities identified and underwritten by us. Upon formation, HVP III committed $110.0 million for a 90% interest in the SL1 Venture, and we committed $12.2 million for a 10% interest. On March 31, 2016, we contributed to the SL1 Venture three self-storage development investments with an aggregate commitment amount of $41.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, the SL1 Venture had closed on eight additional development property investments with a Profits Interest with an aggregate commitment amount of approximately $81.4 million, bringing the total aggregate commitment of SL1 Venture’s investments to $123.3 million. In January 2019, the SL1 Venture acquired the 50.1% equity interests of its developer partners in the LLCs that own the Jacksonville, Atlanta 1, Atlanta 2, and Denver development properties. In November 2019, the SL1 Venture acquired the 50.1% equity interests of its developer partner in the LLC that owns the Raleigh development property. The SLI Venture now owns 100% of the membership interests in the LLCs that own these five facilities.
     Prior to February 20, 2020, we were externally managed and advised by JCAP Advisors, LLC (the “Manager”). The Manager was led by our founder and former Executive Chairman, Dean Jernigan, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), John A. Good, and our President and Chief Investment Officer (“CIO”), Jonathan Perry. On February 20, 2020, our common stockholders voted to approve the internalization of management pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated as of December 16, 2019. Later on February 20, 2020, we closed the internalization described in the Purchase Agreement, resulting, among other things, in the Operating Company acquiring substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of the Manager and each of the employees of the Manager became an employee of the Company. As of February 20, 2020, we are an internally advised REIT.
     We are a Maryland corporation that was organized on October 1, 2014 and has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (“the Code”) as amended. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with certain other requirements for qualification as a REIT set forth in the Code. We are structured as an UPREIT and conduct our investment activities through our Operating Company. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“the 1940 Act”).
     Internalization
     On December 16, 2019, the Company, the Operating Company, the Manager, Dean Jernigan, John A. Good and Jonathan Perry entered into a Purchase Agreement providing for the acquisition by the Operating Company of substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of the Manager (the “Internalization”). A special committee of the Board, consisting solely of all of the independent and disinterested directors (the “Special Committee”), negotiated the terms of the Internalization on behalf of the Company and the Operating Company. The Purchase Agreement and the Internalization were unanimously approved by the Special Committee, and, upon recommendation by the Special 

 
  5
 
Committee, by the Company’s Board of Directors. On February 20, 2020, the Company held a special meeting of common stockholders, at which the Company’s common stockholders approved the proposal necessary for the completion of the Internalization.
 On February 20, 2020, the Company completed the Internalization pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, and the Operating Company issued to the Manager 1,794,872 common units of limited liability company interest in the Operating Company (“OC Units”). In addition, if either (a) the Company’s common stock trades at or above a daily volume weighted average price of $25.00 per share for at least 30 days during any 365-day period prior to December 31, 2024 or (b) there is a change of control of the Company (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) prior to December 31, 2024 that is approved by the Company’s board of directors and the common stockholders of the Company, the Operating Company will issue an additional 769,231 Common OC Units (the “Earn Out Units”) to the Manager. The OC Units issued in the Internalization are Class B OC Units, so the initial distributions payable on the OC Units issued in the Internalization will be prorated for the number of days during the initial distribution period that such OC Units are outstanding. The Class B Common OC Units are otherwise identical to Class A OC Units and will automatically convert to Class A OC Units following the initial distribution period.
 Upon completion of the Internalization, the Company’s current employees, who were previously employed by our former Manager, became employed by the Company and the functions previously performed by the Manager were internalized by the Company. As an internally managed company, the Company will no longer pay the Manager any fees or expense reimbursements arising from the Management Agreement.
     Investment Strategy
     We target investments in newly developed self-storage facilities primarily in the top 50 United States MSAs as delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. We believe these markets are more likely to produce higher long-term investment returns to our stockholders because:
· | they have consistently demonstrated strong long-term self-storage industry fundamentals compared to other markets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | they have higher growth rates and rates of inward migration than other markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | they have demonstrated increased movement (especially by millennials) into smaller dwelling units, creating additional demand for self-storage units;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | they are able to support quicker absorption of increased available units from new development than smaller markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | they have traditionally generated more predictable and stable cash flows and have a higher degree of liquidity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | newly developed self-storage facilities have historically produced higher returns than acquisitions of older facilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We seek to directly originate and structure our target investments utilizing the contacts and self-storage knowledge and experience of our management team, which enables us to: (1) originate broad and adaptable investments that meet the specific needs of our customers and meet our requirements for qualification as a REIT and exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the 1940 Act; (2) have direct access to project developers and enhance our underwriting, structuring and due diligence processes; (3) provide meaningful insight to our customers’ pro forma capital structures, construction budgets, projections and operational decisions; (4) earn structuring and origination fees; and (5) purchase interests of developers in off-market transactions at attractive prices. We believe that our industry knowledge and direct, active engagement with project developers allow us to better monitor investment performance and reduce the risk of loss of principal on our investments.
     We often purchase developers’ interests in the development properties in which we have co-invested. Generally, our development property investment documents require that self-storage facilities we finance be operated for two years following opening before the developers can market and sell such facilities to third parties; however, during that two-year timeframe, our developer partners may seek to sell their interests to us. At such time, we are free to accept, reject and/or negotiate any such offer. We have not typically initiated these transactions; rather, such a buy-out transaction is usually initiated by the developer. To date, developers of 24 projects have sold their interests to us in such privately negotiated transactions.  
     In addition, we possess a ROFR to purchase the underlying self-storage facility in the majority of our development property investments. Our ROFR is typically triggered when the owner of a self-storage facility obtains from an unrelated third party a firm offer for the purchase of the facility that such owner desires to accept. After receipt of notice of such offer, we typically have 10 to 15 business days to exercise our right to purchase the project at the price and on the terms set forth in the bona fide third party offer. Following our exercise of our ROFR, we typically have a 20 to 30 business day inspection period, and we may cancel our exercise of our ROFR prior to the end of such inspection period. After expiration of the inspection period, we will close the purchase of the self-storage facility. Our out-of-pocket funds to close the purchase of a 

 
  6
 
facility acquired by our exercise of our ROFR will typically be the contract purchase price less mortgage debt and less any Profits Interest we have with respect to the facility. In a situation where we continue to hold the debt on the facility, our out-of-pocket funds to close would typically be approximately equal to the owner’s equity and owner’s share of  profit on the sale of the facility. We expect to exercise ROFRs to purchase self-storage facilities we have financed, subject to our ability to obtain financing.
 The majority of investments we originate are in principal amounts ranging from $5 million to $15 million.
 Target Investments
     We focus primarily on originating the following types of investments:

· | Development Property Investments: These investments are intended to finance ground-up construction of self-storage facilities or major self-storage conversion or redevelopment opportunities generally in the top 50 MSAs. These investments are typically funded over a 12 to 30 month period as the developer completes the project. After an initial advance at closing, typically between a nominal amount and 5% to 10% of our committed investment, funding of construction draws typically commences 90 to 120 days following the loan closing, subject to the timing of building permits, which sometimes take up to 180 days or more following closing. Our development investments typically have been structured as first mortgage loans on the development projects, generally with terms of 72 months, interest-only at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, and provide us with 49.9% Profits Interests in the property-owning entities, entitling us to 49.9% of operating and residual cash flows (including sale and refinancing proceeds after debt repayment). We generally provide between 90% and 97% of the cost to develop and construct new development projects, with cost being inclusive of land acquisition, design and other soft costs, hard costs, a developer’s fee and operating and interest reserves designed to fund the project until it is earning enough cash flow to cover all costs, including interest on our investment. As of December 31, 2019, five of our development property investments totaling $55.0 million of aggregate committed amount were structured as preferred equity investments which will be subordinate to a first mortgage loan expected to be procured from a third party lender for 60% to 70% of the cost of the project. We may make additional preferred equity investments such as this in the future.

· | Wholly-Owned Property Investments: In connection with our development property investments and bridge investments, we have typically received ROFRs to acquire the self-storage facilities underlying our investments. Subject to acquisition prices being consistent with our investment objective to create long-term value for our stockholders, we intend to acquire self-storage facilities that we have financed either through the exercise of ROFRs or through privately negotiated transactions with our investment counterparties. Our development property investment documents generally require that the developer operate the facility for two years after it opens for business prior to marketing and selling the property to a third-party; however, during that two-year timeframe, our developer partner may seek to sell its interest in a project to us. Our wholly-owned properties are managed by third-party professional managers, such as CubeSmart, Extra Space Storage, Life Storage and Public Storage. See “—Operations Strategy—Property Management and Operations.”

  In addition to our primary focus, we occasionally and selectively will originate land loans and credit lines to facilitate a development property investment. These loans are intended for borrowers who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition, refinancing, recapitalization or repositioning of a given facility, portfolio or partnership interest or pursuit of development sites. These loans typically have maturities of three years or less. We will provide land loans only if secured by a first mortgage on a self-storage site that has proper zoning and an acceptable environmental condition and only to borrowers who intend to refinance such land loans with development investments made by us. Repayment of such loans is typically personally guaranteed by the prospective developer of the project. These loans have been, and we expect them to continue to be, an insignificant part of our business. These loans are accounted for at historical cost and are not subject to fair value adjustments.

· | Development Property Investments - We had 50 investments totaling an aggregate committed principal amount of approximately $608.9 million to finance the ground-up construction of, or conversion of existing buildings into self-storage facilities. Each development property investment is generally funded as the developer constructs the project and is typically comprised of a first mortgage and a 49.9% Profits Interest to us. The loans are secured by first priority mortgages or deeds of trust on the projects and, in certain cases, first priority security interests in the membership interests of the owners of the projects. Loans comprising development property investments are non-recourse

with customary carve-outs and subject to completion guaranties, are interest-only with a fixed interest rate of typically 6.9% per annum and typically have a term of 72 months. As of December 31, 2019, five of the development property investments totaling $55.0 million of aggregate committed amount were structured as preferred equity investments, which will be subordinate to a first mortgage loan expected to be procured from a third party lender for 60% to 70% of the cost of the project.

  The Company has commenced foreclosure proceedings against the borrower of its $14.3 million Philadelphia development property investment because the borrower has defaulted under the loan by, among other things, failing to pay the general contractor. The total unpaid balance of the loan is $11.2 million. As the investment was a collateral dependent loan, we considered the fair value of the collateral when determining the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2019. The fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2019 is $11.8 million.
     The Company has also commenced foreclosure proceedings against the borrower of its $14.8 million Houston development property because the borrower has defaulted under the loan by, among other things, failing to pay interest and operating expenses with respect to the property. The total unpaid balance of the loan is $14.8 million. As the investment was a collateral dependent loan, we considered the fair value of the collateral when determining the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2019. The fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2019 is $17.8 million.
     As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate committed principal amount of our development property investments for which the underlying self-storage facility was open and operating was approximately $358.3 million and outstanding principal was $337.3 million, as described in more detail in the table below (dollars in thousands):

      On March 7, 2016, we, through our Operating Company, entered into the JV Agreement of Storage Lenders LLC to form SL1 Venture with HVP III, an investment vehicle managed by Heitman. The SL1 Venture was formed for the purpose of providing capital to developers of self-storage facilities identified and underwritten by us. Upon formation, HVP III committed $110.0 million for a 90% interest in the SL1 Venture, and we committed $12.2 million for a 10% interest. On March 31, 2016, we contributed to the SL1 Venture three self-storage development investments in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida that were not yet under construction. These investments had an aggregate committed principal amount of approximately $41.9 million and aggregate drawn balances of $8.1 million (fair value of $7.7 million). In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the SL1 Venture had closed on eight new development property investments with a Profits Interest with an aggregate commitment amount of approximately $81.4 million, bringing the total aggregate commitment of SL1 Venture’s investments to $123.3 million as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2016, HVP III and the Company agreed to true up the balances in the respective members’ capital accounts to be in accordance with the 90% commitment and 10% commitment made by HVP III and the Company, respectively. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2016, HVP III contributed cash of $7.3 million to the SL1 Venture, and the Company received a $7.3 million cash distribution as a return of its capital.
 Under the JV Agreement, we received a priority distribution (after debt service and any reserve but before any other distributions) out of operating cash flow and residual distributions based upon 1% of the committed principal amount of loans made by the SL1 Venture, exclusive of the loans contributed to the SL1 Venture by us. Operating cash flow of the SL1 Venture (after debt service, reserves and the foregoing priority distributions) will be distributed in accordance with capital commitments. Residual cash flow from capital and other events (after debt service, reserves and priority distributions) will be distributed (i) pro rata in accordance with capital commitments (its “Percentage Interest”) until each member has received a return of all capital contributed; (ii) pro rata in accordance with each member’s Percentage Interest until Heitman has achieved a 14% internal rate of return; (iii) to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 10% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 10% until Heitman has achieved a 17% internal rate of return; (iv) to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 20% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 20% until Heitman has achieved a 20% internal rate of return; and (v) any excess to Heitman in an amount equal to its Percentage Interest less 30% and to us in an amount equal to our Percentage Interest plus 30%. However, we will not be entitled to any such promoted interest prior to the earlier to occur of the third anniversary of the JV Agreement and Heitman receiving distributions to the extent necessary to provide Heitman with a 1.48 multiple on its contributed capital.
 Under the JV Agreement, during the pendency of the SL1 Venture, and as long as the SL1 Venture holds any assets, Heitman has the right of first offer to participate in any joint venture or similar program pursued by us on substantially the same terms as those set forth in the JV Agreement. This right of first offer includes any investment of debt or equity or otherwise, directly or indirectly, in one or more new joint ventures or similar programs for the purposes of funding or providing development loans or financing, directly or indirectly, for the development, construction or conversion of self-storage facilities.
 On January 28, 2019, the SL1 Venture purchased 100% of the Class A membership units of the LLCs that owned the Atlanta 1, Jacksonville, Atlanta 2, and Denver development property investments with a Profits Interest for an aggregate purchase price of $12.1 million. These purchases increased the SL1 Venture’s ownership interest on each development property investment from 49.9% to 100%. The SL1 Venture now wholly owns the self-storage properties through these LLCs. On February 27, 2019, the SL1 Venture closed on a $36.1 million term loan secured by these four properties. On November 7, 2019, the SL1 Venture purchased 100% of the Class A membership units of the LLC that owned the Raleigh development property investment with a Profits Interest. The SLI Venture now owns 100% of the membership interests in the LLCs that own these five facilities.

     We believe our ability to capitalize on the self-storage industry reputation, relationships, market knowledge and expertise of our management team provides us with substantial benefits in sourcing, underwriting and evaluating attractive investments, executing such investments quickly and effectively, and managing our assets. Our management team is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations, including sourcing and originating investment opportunities, providing underwriting services, processing approvals for all loans, acquisitions and other investments in our portfolio and negotiating the terms of any purchase of an investment counterparty’s interest in a self-storage facility. Our Investment Committee, currently consisting of Messrs. Good and Perry, reviews all investments to determine whether they meet our investment guidelines and are otherwise appropriate for our portfolio. The following is a description of the key elements of our business operations:

 Investment Origination
     We utilize the self-storage industry knowledge and relationships of our management team to originate a substantial majority of our investments. Six of our 16 employees, including Messrs. Good and Perry, are actively engaged in the origination process. Our management team leverages contacts with self-storage facility owners, developers, national commercial real estate brokers, commercial mortgage loan brokers, financial institutions and other persons with an active presence in the self-storage industry in the United States seeking investment opportunities. Each employee responsible for originating investments has the self-storage industry knowledge, real estate and finance expertise to determine what investment structure best meets the needs of our partner and the optimal structure of a financing solution. We believe the self-storage industry experience, knowledge and relationships of our management team uniquely position us to significantly grow our investment portfolio.     Underwriting
     Each of our employees who originate investment opportunities evaluates such opportunities in accordance with specific underwriting guidelines, policies and procedures in order to determine suitability for both our partner and our portfolio. We perform underwriting due diligence on all proposed transactions prior to investment approval and commitment.
     In general, our underwriting guidelines require evaluation of the following factors, as appropriate:
    
· | the character, integrity and background of the developer/owner of the project;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed ownership structure of the project, the financial strength, real estate and self-storage industry experience of the project principals, background check on principals, third party appraisal, insurance review, and environmental and engineering studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | appropriate sub-market demographics, including population density, average household incomes, percentage of non-subsidized renters, per capita self-storage square footage, competitors and rental rates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | with respect to development projects, the construction budget, required interest reserves, the guaranteed maximum price construction contract, buy-out of subcontractors, zoning and entitlement issues for construction and major redevelopment loans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | with respect to existing projects, the construction quality of the self-storage facility to determine future maintenance and capital expenditure requirements, stage of lease-up, quality of management, rental market conditions and prevailing market cap rates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | historical, current and projected rental rates, occupancy levels, revenues and expenses in the sub-market, and for existing facilities, as to that facility;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the historical, current and projected rental rates, occupancy levels and expense levels at comparable facilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the potential for near term revenue growth and opportunity for expense reduction and increased operating efficiencies; the facility’s location, its attributes and competitive position within its market, existing competition as well as future competition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the review of title status and survey;
--+---------------------------------------


· | the requirements for any reserves, including those for immediate repairs or rehabilitation, replacement reserves, real estate taxes and facility casualty and liability insurance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the availability of capital for refinancing by the borrower if a loan does not fully amortize; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the internal rate of return.
--+-----------------------------

      Key factors considered in credit decisions include debt service coverage, LTV and LTC ratios, development yield, debt yield, cash equity remaining in the deal or level of cash out to the borrower, competitive set relative performance, and facility historical and projected operating performance. Key factors considered in decisions to acquire 100% of the interests in a self-storage facility include stage of lease-up, historical cash flows and current run rate cash flows relative to run rate interest income on our development property investment, leasing experience of the facility and the projected stabilized cap rate on our total investment cost. Consideration is also given to other factors such as developer concentration, facility concentration (both by type and location), identification of strategy for ultimate disposition by partner and expected changes in market conditions.
     Investment Approval Process
     Our team completes the rigorous underwriting process described above prior to submitting proposals to our Investment Committee for final approval. After a proposed investment is underwritten, a detailed written investment memorandum and financial summary is prepared. The memorandum includes a description of the prospective investment counterparty and project, demographic and competitive information about the project, a description of the site and the self-storage facility located or to be located on the site, the proposed use of investment proceeds, and an analysis of favorable investment factors and key risk factors. In addition, the presentation provides net operating income projections, development and investment yields, competitive data and coverage ratios. Where the investment involves an operating property (for example, 

 
  13
 
bridge investments or outright purchases), the memorandum contains information regarding physical condition and operations. Each transaction is presented for approval to our Investment Committee, which consists of Messrs. Good and Perry. All transactions require the approval of all members of our Investment Committee. In addition, the approval of our Board of Directors is required if more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single project.
     Following the approval and closing of any transaction, our investment management group provide customary monitoring and servicing to assure that contract terms have been satisfied and that the project is being managed appropriately.
     Investment Processing and Servicing
     We service all of our development property investments with an internal investment management team. Our investment management team is assisted in servicing development property investments, including processing construction draw requests, by a nationally known construction consultant. The responsibilities of our investment management team include:
· | assisting in investment due diligence, documentation and closing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analyzing and processing draw requests;
--+----------------------------------------


· | ensuring that development projects remain free from impermissible liens and encumbrances;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | collecting and analyzing project and developer financial information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | determining compliance with ongoing covenants;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | collecting interest, fees and principal amounts owed on loans; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assisting our accounting and finance team in determining the fair value of our investments and ensuring proper accounting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our investment management team utilizes the services of nationally-known independent consultants to inspect projects that are in the construction process and provide guidance with respect to the processing of construction draws.
     Property Management and Operations
     Our developer partners manage the ownership entity for each project they develop; however, we require each self-storage facility that is the subject of a development property investment to be operationally managed by a professional self-storage manager, which we define as a manager who (i) has a presence on the first page of Google in the facility’s market, (ii) runs a professional and adequately staffed call center, and (iii) maintains a state-of-the-art revenue management function staffed by experienced professionals utilizing the most current technology. We also utilize professional self-storage managers for all wholly-owned self-storage facilities. We believe the benefits of professional third-party management include:
· | national branding of the facilities providing enhanced marketing and top tier internet presence;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significant economies of scale that reduce operating and G&A expense;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | sophisticated revenue management that optimizes profitability;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | access to state-of-the-art accounting and information systems that enhance reporting; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continuous exposure to latest management trends and thought leadership in the self-storage sector that benefits the relationships with customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As of December 31, 2019, our developer partners in 52 out of our 56 development property investments (including those made by our SL1 Venture) have selected CubeSmart as the third-party manager, one has selected Life Storage, two have selected ExtraSpace Storage and one has selected Public Storage. Fourteen of our wholly-owned facilities are managed by CubeSmart, while one is managed by ExtraSpace.
     Once a self-storage facility opens for business, we monitor operational data. We are granted full access to the third-party manager’s property and financial reporting systems with respect to the self-storage facilities such manager manages for us. Our investment management team, consisting of our President and CIO, Senior Vice President of Investment Management, one of our Directors of Operations and our Manager of Portfolio Investments, regularly reviews operating and financial information for our facilities, including property operating budgets, summary rental experience reports, facility leasing dashboards, monthly profit and loss reports and other relevant information. In addition, we have a consulting relationship with the former chief operating officer of a large self-storage REIT pursuant to which he from time to time assists our team in reviewing property operations and makes suggestions for improvements. We share pertinent information with our developers to assist them with solid management practices. We believe that active oversight of property operations is essential to protecting our invested capital, 

 
  14
 
collaborating with our developer partners to optimize profitability, holding our third-party managers accountable for performance and ensuring timely management decisions that maximize the value of our investments.
     Investment Guidelines
     Our Board of Directors has adopted the following general guidelines for our investments and borrowings:
    
· | no investment will be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | no investment will be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | no more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single project and no more than 20% of our equity, determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in projects controlled by a single borrower or group of affiliated borrowers that would form a consolidated group under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | over time our average leverage will be in the range of 25% to 35% of our total assets, but we may borrow up to 100% of the principal value of certain development loans secured by first mortgages;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we will maintain a portfolio of geographically diverse assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our Manager must seek the approval of a majority of our independent directors before engaging in any transaction that falls outside of our investment guidelines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      These investment guidelines may be changed or waived by our Board of Directors (which must include a majority of our independent directors) without the approval of our stockholders.
     Competition
 Our financial results depend, in part, on our ability to make investments and acquire facilities that produce returns at favorable spreads over our cost of capital. In originating or acquiring our target investments, we may compete to a limited degree with other self-storage REITs, primarily including five publicly-traded self-storage REITs (Public Storage, Extra-Space Storage, CubeSmart, Life Storage, Inc. and National Storage Affiliates) as well as several private national self-storage owner-operators, and, with respect to financing transactions, to a greater degree with other commercial mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, such as business development companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the U.S. Government. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 1940 Act. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for sources of financing. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
 In the face of this competition, we believe our self-storage industry expertise provides us with a competitive advantage and helps us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential investments. This expertise enables us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Moreover, we believe many traditional institutional investors do not possess the self-storage industry knowledge or experience to appropriately assess the riskiness of investments in self-storage facilities, and, accordingly, such investors may not compete effectively on pricing and terms for self-storage investments we originate. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable investments in our target investments and could also affect the pricing of these securities”.
 Employees
 We currently have 16 employees who provide services to the Company, all of which are full-time employees.
 Exemption from Regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940
 We conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an 

 
  15
 
investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the “40% test”). Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exemption from the definition of investment company for private funds set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act.
 We are organized as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly- and/or majority-owned subsidiaries. We conduct our operations so that we and the Operating Company do not hold “investment securities” in excess of 40% of the value of our Operating Company’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we have formed or may form in the future that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets (as determined under the 1940 Act) on an unconsolidated basis. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act because we will not engage primarily, propose to engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries, we are and continue to be primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries.
 If the value of our holdings in investment securities exceeds 40% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain another exception or exemption from the 1940 Act (see below), we could, among other things, be required either to (a) substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, any of which could negatively affect our business, the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions, which also could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price for our shares of common stock. If we or any of our subsidiaries were required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the registered entity would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to capital structure (including restrictions on the ability to use leverage), management, operations, prohibitions on transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations.
 In 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, including the nature of the assets that are qualifying interests for purposes of the exemption and whether mortgage REITs should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act status of REITs, including the SEC or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations.
 Although we monitor our portfolio periodically and prior to each investment origination or acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this exemption from registration for these subsidiaries.
 In addition, we and/or our subsidiaries may rely upon other exclusions, including the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(6) of the Investment Company Act (which excludes, among other things, parent entities whose primary business is conducted through majority-owned subsidiaries relying upon the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), discussed above), from the definition of an investment company and the registration requirements under the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategy accordingly.
 To the extent that the SEC staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon the exemptions we and our subsidiaries rely on from the 1940 Act, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen.
