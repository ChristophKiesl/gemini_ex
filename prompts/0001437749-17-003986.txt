ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our mission is to provide simple useful services that help people unlock the power of the Internet.
 
We accomplish this by reducing the complexity our customers’ experience as they access the Internet (at home or on the go) and while using Internet services such as domain name registration, email and other Internet services. We are organized, managed and report our financial results as two segments, Network Access Services and Domain Services, which are differentiated primarily by their services, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate.
 
Our management regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we utilize our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. To assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies, our management regularly reviews revenue for each of our service offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the key business metrics driving our business. Accordingly, we report Network Access Services and Domain Services revenue separately.
 
Network Access Services
 
Network Access Services includes mobile, fixed high-speed Internet access services, Internet hosting and network consulting services. 
 
Our mobile services are primarily distributed through the Ting website and to a lesser extent certain third-party retail stores and on-line retailers. We generate revenues from the sale of retail telephony services, mobile phone hardware and related accessories (“Ting Mobile”) to individuals and small businesses through the Ting website. Ting Mobile’s primary focus is providing simple and easy to use services, including simple value pricing, in particular for multi-line accounts, and superior customer care. 
The Company also derives revenue from the sale of fixed high-speed Internet access (“Ting Internet”) in select towns including Holly Springs, North Carolina; Westminster, Maryland; and Charlottesville, Virginia. Our primarily sales channel of Ting Internet is through the Ting website. The primary focus of Ting Internet is to provide reliable Gigabit Internet services to consumer and business customers. We also derive revenue from providing Internet hosting and network consulting services to business customers in Central Virginia through our acquisition of a 70% share in Ting Virginia, LLC on February 27, 2015. 
 
Revenues from Ting Mobile and Ting Internet are generated in the United States and are provided on a monthly basis with no fixed contract term.
 
Domain Services
 
Domain Services include wholesale and retail domain name registration services, value added services and portfolio services. We earn revenues primarily from the registration fees charged to resellers in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations; the sale of retail Internet domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses; and by making our portfolio of domain names available for sale.
 
Domain Services revenues are attributed to the country in which the contract originates, primarily Canada.
 
Domain Services’ primary distribution channel is a global network of more than 13,000 resellers in more than 100 countries who typically provide their customers, the end-users of the Internet, with a critical component for establishing and maintaining an online presence. Our primary focus is serving the needs of this network of resellers by providing superior services, easy-to-use interfaces, proactive and attentive customer service. We seek to provide superior customer service to our resellers by anticipating their business needs and technical requirements. This includes providing easy-to-use interfaces that enable resellers to quickly and easily integrate our services into their individual business processes. We also provide “second tier” support to our resellers in the event resellers experience issues with our services. In addition, our Network Operating Center provides proactive support to our resellers by monitoring all network infrastructure to address deficiencies before customer services are impacted.
 
We believe that the underlying platforms for our services are among the most mature, reliable and functional reseller-oriented provisioning and management platforms in our industry, and we continue to refine, evolve and improve these services for both resellers and end-users.

Wholesale, primarily branded as OpenSRS, derives revenue from its Domain Service and from providing Value-Added Services. The OpenSRS Domain Service manages 15.0 million domain names under the Tucows ICANN registrar accreditation and for other registrars under their own accreditations. Value-Added Services include hosted email which provides email delivery and webmail access to millions of mailboxes, SSL certificates, and reseller billing services. All of these services are made available to end-users through a network of over 13,000 web hosts, Internet service providers (“ISPs”), and other resellers around the world. In addition, we also derive revenue from the bulk sale of domain names and advertising from the OpenSRS Domain Expiry Stream.
  
Retail, primarily through our retail website hover.com (“Hover”), derives revenues from the sale of domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses. Retail also includes our Real Names Service – based on over 36,000 surname domains – that allows roughly two-thirds of Americans to purchase an email address based on their last name.
 
The Tucows Domain Portfolio generates revenue by offering the portfolio’s domain names for resale via our reseller network and other channels. In addition, we generate revenue from the payments for the sale of rights to gTLD strings under the New gTLD program.
 
On January 20, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire eNom, Incorporated, domain registration wholesale and retail company, from Rightside Group, Ltd. Please see "Note 16(a) – Subsequent Events" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
 
Additional information about segments can be found in “Note 17 – Segment information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
 
Net Revenues
 
Network Access Services
 
Mobile Service
 
We derive revenue from Ting Mobile’s sale of retail mobile phones, accessories and services to individuals and small businesses nationally. Revenues are generated primarily through the Ting website with telephony services charged on a monthly post-paid basis with no fixed contract term, with a significant portion of our customers having multiple devices on their accounts. 
Fixed high-speed Internet Service
 
The Company also derive revenue from the sale of fixed high-speed Internet access (“Ting Internet”) in select towns including Holly Springs, North Carolina; Westminster, Maryland; and Charlottesville, Virginia. Our primarily sales channel of Ting Internet is through the Ting website with monthly no fixed term contracts. Revenue from hardware and installation is recognized at time of delivery. We also derive revenue from providing Internet hosting and network consulting services to business customers in Central Virginia through our acquisition of a 70% share in Ting Virginia, LLC on February 27, 2015. 
Domain Services
 
Wholesale - OpenSRS Domain Service
 
Historically, our OpenSRS Domain Service constituted the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration, renewal, transfer and management of domain names. In addition, this service fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a reseller will engage us, enabling us to follow on with other services and allowing us to add to our portfolio by purchasing names registered through us upon their expiration.
 
We receive revenues for each domain registration or other Internet service processed through our system by Service Providers.
 
With respect to the sale of domain registrations, we earn registration fees in connection with each new, renewed and transferred-in registration and from providing provisioning services to Service Providers and registrars on a monthly basis. Domain registrations are generally purchased for terms of one to ten years. Payments for the full term of all services, or billed revenue, are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service. This accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year.

Wholesale – OpenSRS Value-Added Services
 
We derive revenue from our hosted email service through our global distribution network. Our hosted email service is offered on a per account, per month basis, and provides resellers with a reliable, scalable “white label” hosted email solution that can be customized to their branding and business model requirements. The hosted email service also includes spam and virus filtering on all accounts. End-users can access the hosted email service via a full-featured, multi-language AJAX-enabled web interface or through traditional desktop email clients.
 
We also derive revenue from other Value-Added Services primarily from provisioning SSL certificates and the bulk sale of domain names and advertising from the OpenSRS Domain Expiry Stream.
 
In addition, we provide billing, provisioning and customer care software solutions to ISPs through our Platypus billing software.
 
Retail – Hover
 
We derive revenues from Hover's sale of retail Internet domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses.
 
Portfolio
 
We derive revenue from our portfolio of domain names by displaying advertising on the domains and by making them available for sale. When a user types one of these domain names into a web browser, they are presented with dynamically generated links that are pay-per-click advertising. Every time a user clicks on one of these links, it generates revenue for us through our partnership with third-parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click advertising (“parked page vendors”).
 
Portfolio names are sold through our premium domain name service, auctions or in negotiated sales. The size of our domain name portfolio varies over time, as we acquire and sell domains on a regular basis to maximize the overall value and revenue generation potential of our portfolio. In evaluating names for sale, we consider the potential foregone revenue from pay-per-click advertising, as well as other factors. The name will be offered for sale if, based on our evaluation, the name is deemed non-essential to our business and management believes that deriving proceeds from the sale is strategically more beneficial to the Company. In addition, we generate revenue from the payments for the sale of rights to gTLD strings under ICANN’s New gTLD Program.
 
Portfolio names that have been acquired from third-parties or through acquisition are included as intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we are well positioned in the wholesale domain registration and email markets due in part to our highly-recognized “Tucows” and “OpenSRS” brands and the respect they confer on us as a defender of end-user rights and reseller-friendly approaches to doing business. We were among the first group of 34 registrars to be accredited by ICANN in 1999, and we remain active in Internet governance issues.
 
Our success and ability to compete depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our brand name and technology. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
We have registered the Tucows trademark in the United States, Canada and the European Union and we register additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate and where such protection is available.
 
We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring all employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to commit to confidentiality, non-disclosure and work-for-hire agreements. All of our employees are required to sign confidentiality and non-use agreements, which provide that any rights they may have in copyrightable works or patentable technologies accrue to us. Before entering into discussions with potential vendors and partners about our business and technologies, we require them to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. If these discussions result in a license or other business relationship, we also generally require that the agreement containing the parties’ rights and obligations include provisions for the protection of its intellectual property rights.

Customers
 
The majority of the customers to whom we provide reseller services are generally either web hosts or ISPs. A small number are consultants and designers providing our services to their business clients. Both our Retail Domain Services and our Network Access Services customers are a very broad mix of consumers, small businesses and corporations.
 
No customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.
 
While web hosts and ISPs are capitalizing on the growth in Internet usage and the demand for new services, they also face significant competition from numerous other service providers with competitive or comparable offerings. This has led such web hosts and ISPs to focus on core competencies, as such resellers are increasingly seeking to outsource non-core services. Outsourcing enables these resellers to better focus on customer acquisition and retention efforts by eliminating the need to own, develop and support non-core applications in-house.
  
Seasonality
 
During the summer months and certain other times of the year, such as major holidays, Internet usage often declines. As a result, many of our services (OpenSRS, Hover and Ting) may experience reduced demand during these times. For example, our experience shows that new domain registrations decline during the summer months and around the year-end holidays. Seasonality may also affect advertising, which may have a slight impact on advertisement-based revenue. These seasonal effects could cause fluctuations in our financial results. For Ting Mobile, we see increased gross activation and churn activity in late summer as part of back-to-school activities as well as the holiday season in December.
Competition
 
Our competitors may be divided into the following groups:
 

• | US Mobile Phone Service providers such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, who primarily compete with Ting Mobile Services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | US Broadband providers such as Comcast, Verizon and CenturyLink, who primarily compete with Ting Internet Services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy and Web.com who compete with our Reseller customers in Wholesale Domain Services and with Hover.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wholesale-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy, who market services to resellers such as our customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wholesale Email Service providers, such as Google, Microsoft, Bluetie and MailTrust.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect to continue to experience significant competition from the competitors identified above and, as our business continues to develop, we expect to encounter competition from other providers. Service providers, Internet portals, web hosting companies, email hosting companies, outsourced application companies, country code registries and major telecommunication firms may broaden their services to include services we offer.
 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our Network Access Services are:
 

• | Providing superior customer service experience
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Providing a simple and friendly user experience through more usable web and application interfaces and more fair and transparent pricing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Being agnostic on telephony and internet hardware, including phones and network routers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing superior technology, speed and reliability with fiber to the home services
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our Domain Services are:
 

• | Providing superior customer service by anticipating the technical requirements and business objectives of resellers and providing them with technical advice to help them understand how our services can be customized to meet their particular needs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing cost savings over in-house solutions by relieving resellers of the expense of acquiring and maintaining hardware and software and the associated administrative burden;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enabling resellers to better manage their relationships with their end-users;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Facilitating scalability through an infrastructure designed to support millions of transactions across millions of end-users; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing superior technology and infrastructure, consisting of industry-leading software and hardware that allow resellers to provide these services to their customers without having to make substantial investments in their own software or hardware.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although we encounter pricing pressure in many markets in which we compete, we believe the effects of that pressure are mitigated by the fact that we deliver a high degree of value to our customers through our business and technical practices. We believe our status as a trusted supplier also allows us to mitigate the effects of this type of competition. We believe that the long-term relationships we have made with many customers results in a sense of certainty that would not be available to those customers through a competitor.
