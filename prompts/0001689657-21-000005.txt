Overview 
Berkeley Lights is a leading Digital Cell Biology company focused on enabling and accelerating the rapid development and commercialization of biotherapeutics and other cell-based products. The Berkeley Lights Platform captures deep phenotypic, functional and genotypic information for tens of thousands of single cells in parallel and can also deliver the live biology customers desire in the form of the best cells. This is a new way to capture and interpret the qualitative language of biology and translate it into single-cell specific digital information, referred to as Digital Cell Biology. We currently focus on enabling the large and rapidly growing markets of antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology with our platform. Our goal is to establish the Berkeley Lights Platform as the standard throughout the cell-based product value chain by increasing the probability of successful product development for our customers. 
Cells have tremendous capabilities and are an effective means to discover, develop and manufacture a wide range of products, including therapies for diseases, new and sustainable foods and industrial materials. Harnessing these capabilities requires finding and using the best cells, which can result in finding the next blockbuster drug or saving millions of dollars per year on manufacturing costs. However, biology is extremely complex and not deterministic. Cells are microscopic factories that make minute amounts of a variety of valuable proteins, such as antibodies, and therefore require a high degree of precision when analyzed individually. Finding the best cells can require searching through millions of cells, or often even more challenging, starting with a limited sample of precious cells. Finding the best cells requires more than just capturing a cell’s genetic code, it requires the deep understanding generated by functional characterization across many parameters, a process we call Deep Opto Profiling. Many existing methods to perform functional characterization of single cells are manual and fragmented processes that we believe do not scale to meet the significant challenges of measuring biological complexity. Furthermore, methods that characterize larger numbers of cells in bulk lack single-cell precision or operate at single-cell resolution but without functional validation of that cell. Successful cell-based product development requires living, functionally validated cells. We believe today’s methods functionally characterize insufficiently and too late in the process. We believe that harnessing the cell’s true capability, to develop biotherapeutics and other cell-based products, requires functional characterization of living single cells at large scale, cost effectively and in an integrated manner, early in the value chain. 
We developed the Berkeley Lights Platform to provide the most advanced environment for rapid functional characterization of single cells at scale. The Berkeley Lights Platform can be used to characterize the performance of cells relevant to the desired cell-based product early in the discovery process and then connect this phenotypic data to the genetic code for each cell. In contrast, current genomic technologies find sequences first and fail to deliver the functional information early in the process. Functional validation early means letting poorly performing cells fail early while rapidly advancing the best candidates forward, before incurring significant research and development expense. We repeat this process of fail and advance many times throughout the process, identifying the best biology and delivering the best cells for what we believe will deliver the best product. We believe our platform rapidly provides the deepest information, with linked phenotypic and genotypic data, on tens of thousands of live single cells relevant to the customers’ end product specifications. We believe we are the only company exclusively focused on this approach to Digital Cell Biology, and we believe this level of scale and precision is not attainable with other approaches. This allows our customers to find the best cells by: 
•Performing rapid functional characterization of tens of thousands of single cells in parallel; 
•Precisely controlling the environment around each cell, and maintaining cells in a healthy state for further use; 
•Accessing a high degree of cell biodiversity; 
•Deep Opto Profiling of the relevant phenotypic characteristics, at single-cell resolution over time and connecting this to the genotypic information for each cell; 
•Performing a broad range of workflows, including single-cell assays, on an integrated platform; and 
•Digitally aggregating, accessing and analyzing a rich data library for each single cell. 
Using our platform, customers can perform functional characterization of single cells at scale, effectively, more often and early in the product development process. We believe this enables them to find the best cells and best product candidates earlier and faster in their processes to: 
•Accelerate their product development cycles; 
•Improve process yield and lower costs throughout their value chain; 
•Enable a broad range of complex therapeutic modalities in biopharmaceuticals; 
•Increase the probability of successfully developing cell-based products; 
•Achieve revenue from their cell-based products sooner and potentially extend the product lifetime on the market prior to patent expiration; and 
•Increase return on investment for their cell-based products. 
Our platform is a fully integrated, end-to-end solution, comprised of proprietary consumables, including our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and advanced application and workflow software. Customers load onto our system their live cell samples, as well as media and reagents, then the cells are imported onto our OptoSelect chips where integrated workflows are performed to assess specific cell functions and attributes. Our platform captures and delivers rich single-cell data to find the best cells. We believe this brings common biological cell processing into the digital age. Our platform leverages proprietary OptoElectro Positioning (OEP) technology, which enables deterministic positioning of living single cells and other micro-objects using light. OEP is a core technology of our platform and allows for a high level of control over live single cells or other micro-objects throughout the functional characterization process. Our platform includes: 
•OptoSelect chips—Proprietary single-use opto-fluidic chips on which thousands of single-cells are functionally characterized in parallel. Aided by our software, these chips use OEP to select and move thousands of cells and other micro-objects in parallel through a microfluidic circuit into individual nanoliter sized chambers we call NanoPens, located on the chips. Within the NanoPens, our platform can precisely control the environment, perform a large variety of single-cell assays and record with high resolution imaging each single cell over time, providing a predictable analytical window into live single-cell biology. Our OptoSelect chips contain up to 20,000 individual NanoPens on a single chip and are compatible with both mammalian and non-mammalian cells. 
•Reagent kits—Support on-chip phenotypic and genotypic single-cell assays and off-chip processes for upstream and downstream analysis and support multiple species and cell types. We also supply media and media additives for certain cell types. 
•Advanced automation systems—Three advanced automation systems, Beacon and Lightning, which are designed to run our proprietary workflows, and Culture Station, which allows our customers to increase the throughput of workflows requiring high volume, multi-day cell culture. Beacon can run workflows on four chips in parallel, utilizing up to 80,000 NanoPens, while Lightning runs workflows on one chip at a time. 
•Advanced application and workflow software—Tailored software packages that enable customers to design, automate and scale reproducible workflows and collect, aggregate, analyze and report data on each cell in each NanoPen, far beyond what we believe is possible with current manual workflows. 
Our commercial workflows, each of which are distinct offerings, are made up of four modules we call Import, Culture, Assay and Export. These modules can be adapted, interchanged and deployed with a variety of single-cell assays to address specific applications and a variety of cell types. We believe this versatility facilitates rapid development of new workflow offerings and virtually unlimited workflow commercialization opportunities. We have developed and will continue to develop and commercialize proprietary workflows across large 
markets by leveraging existing workflows and assays. Over time, our goal is to enable customers to standardize many of their processes on our platform utilizing our workflows. We believe we are the only company commercializing a platform that can do this in a scalable way. 
To drive new workflow development, we created our Berkeley Lights BioFoundry, which we believe represents the largest single location capacity for functionally characterizing cells. In our BioFoundry, we practice and develop workflows and functional assays that are applicable throughout the value chain of our target markets. 
Leveraging our BioFoundry’s capacity and the precision of our platform, we can also look deep into the immune repertoire to discover difficult to find proprietary biological assets, such as antibodies and TCRs, that may offer commercialization opportunities. We also are developing new workflows through work conducted in the Innovation Lab part of our BioFoundry, which primarily focuses on biological assays outside of, or adjacent to, our target markets.
We have grown our workflow library with increasing velocity since the introduction of our first workflow in December of 2016, and as of December 31, 2020, we offered eight commercial workflows incorporating sixteen assays and eleven cell classes. Our current workflows target customers in the antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology markets. Commonalities among certain workflows used to functionally characterize single cells in one market allow us to leverage the workflows developed for that market to improve and accelerate workflow development timelines for another market and facilitate adoption of our platform across markets. 
While our platform is currently utilized primarily in the discovery and development stages of the value chain and marketed as research use only, or RUO, we believe that the capabilities of our platform will enable us to capture an increasingly greater share of our addressable market opportunity and the value chain across cell-based product industries, including being incorporated into the commercial manufacturing process. 
Industry 
Cells are the basic building blocks of life and have evolved over billions of years to create enormous biodiversity. They share significant common functions but can look and behave very differently. Cells can make valuable products and many of these products, such as biotherapies, cannot be economically produced any other way. Over the past two decades a main focus within cell biology has been on the understanding of the cell’s genotypic information. This has given rise to large markets like next generation sequencing, single-cell genomic analysis and synthetic biology. However, cells express genotypic information in a variety of ways that, in most cases, cannot be accurately predicted. There remains a significant gap in the understanding of how a cell’s genetic code truly impacts its function, behavior and performance. Connecting a cell’s genotype to its phenotype requires functional testing, which we believe has become a critical bottleneck in the development and manufacturing of biotherapeutics and other cell-based products. 
Increased understanding of cells has enabled the discovery, development and production of therapies for diseases, new and sustainable foods, industrial materials and many other items. While the applications and markets for cell-based products are significant and rapidly growing, we believe we are only at the beginning of harnessing cells’ full capabilities. 
The challenges of harnessing biology and making cell-based products 
Biology is complex. It is highly diverse, integrated and not deterministic, and therefore presents a challenge of scale. Despite significant advances in the understanding of cells and their tremendous capabilities, cells are exceptionally challenging to work with. They are very complex, heterogeneous, and at any moment, thousands of processes occur inside a cell that impact its production of a multitude of proteins, its energy expenditure and its performance of a specific function. Cells are also sensitive to their environment. They interact with other surrounding cells and when removed from their in vivo environment can quickly change their phenotype or die. Experiments to find the best biotherapeutic may require searching through millions of cells or starting with a limited sample of precious cells. Cells are microscopic factories that make small amounts of a variety of valuable proteins, such as antibodies, and finding the best cells requires highly precise and sensitive measurements of such limited cell output. Addressing these challenges requires a solution that can functionally test thousands of cells in parallel at the single-cell level.
Limitations of existing methods for functionally characterizing cells 
Significant progress has been made in the functional characterization of single cells. High resolution microscopy, fluorescent imaging, high-speed fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and sequencing have all contributed individually to advancement of this field. However, integration of these capabilities and automation of these common methods across technologies remain lacking, and we believe an integrated workflow is critical for rapid advancement of the functional characterization of single cells. In addition, these methods typically result in the death of most cells involved in the process, preventing the re-capture of the best cells with the right characteristics for the cell-based product. Current technologies and methods are either only capable of handling large numbers of cells in bulk or performing bulk sequencing at the single-cell level without functionally characterizing each single cell. We also believe these methods inadequately capture the complex parallel processes happening within a cell, as they often only capture a single snapshot of the behavior in time. Living cells are real-time systems that change and adjust over time to environmental changes across a very large number of variables. Furthermore, each individual cell is different, and therefore measurements on one set of cells may not correspond to the actual characteristics of another set of the same type of cells, especially when the measurements are made at different points in time and under different environmental conditions. We believe common methods lack precision, do not capture the multidimensional aspects of cell behavior and do not scale to meet the significant challenges of measuring a cell’s biological complexity. As a result, functional testing is deployed insufficiently or ineffectively across the cell-based product value chain. 
Finding the best cells requires a solution that enables: 
•Performing rapid functional characterization of tens of thousands of single cells in parallel at the highest level of biodiversity; 
•Precisely controlling the environment around each cell, and maintaining cells in a healthy state for further use; 
•Accessing a high degree of cell biodiversity; 
•Deep Opto Profiling of the relevant phenotypic characteristics, at single-cell resolution over time and connecting this to the genotypic information for each cell; 
•Performing a broad range of workflows, including single-cell assays, on an integrated platform; and 
•Digitally aggregating single-cell information to create a rich data library for each cell. 
Limitations of centralized biology to address infectious diseases
Infectious diseases emerge in single locations globally. In the early stages of epidemic outbreak, the sum total of the human immune response to the pathogen occurs in that single location. Unfortunately today’s biopharmaceutical discovery infrastructure is largely centralized and not well suited to rapidly respond to these emerging pathogens. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak clearly demonstrated the challenge between local pathogen emergence and centralized response. The people who had the most immediate access to recovering patient blood did not appear to have immediate access to certain state-of-the-art antibody discovery technology. The people who had certain state-of-the-art technology did not have immediate access to recovering patient blood. We believe that the speed and ability to respond to emerging pathogens can be dramatically improved with a state-of-the-art solution that is proximal to the initial outbreak. If a proximal solution was available at the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, we believe functional antibodies could have been discovered months earlier. It is our vision to place the Berkeley Lights Platform at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDCs, and regional centers of excellence worldwide. We envision these platforms will be networked via the cloud to provide global access to the latest Berkeley Lights workflows, to rapidly return diverse functional antibody sequences to biopharmaceutical companies for development and manufacture of the therapeutic antibodies. This capability could potentially enable rapid discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies targeting emerging pathogens anywhere in the world. This strategy could also be applied to endemic infectious diseases in the ongoing search for broadly neutralizing antibodies. We believe that the Berkeley Lights Platform can leverage automation, workflow standardization and Deep Opto Profiling to become a key enabler of this form of distributed biological processing. 
Digital Cell Biology enabled by the Berkeley Lights Platform 
Digital Cell Biology 
Digital Cell Biology is a new way to capture and interpret the qualitative language of biology, both phenotypic and genotypic information, from a highly biodiverse cell population, and translate it into a single-cell specific digital deep profile. The Berkeley Lights Platform combines bioscience, information and technology to deliver deep phenotypic and functional information linked to genotypes across thousands of living cells in parallel at the single-cell level. Using our platform, customers can leverage the power of Digital Cell Biology to rapidly engage in Deep Opto Profiling of cells they wish to understand, characterize and use in their cell-based product development processes. 
The Berkeley Lights Platform 
We developed the Berkeley Lights Platform to create the most advanced environment for functional testing of single cells and provide customers local access to Digital Cell Biology for developing cell-based products on a global scale. Our platform delivers live biology, in the form of the best cells for the desired cell-based product. Using our platform, customers perform integrated workflows specific to a field of use to profile and capture relevant single-cell data, throughout the duration of the workflow, on tens of thousands of cells individually, in parallel and within a contained and precisely controlled environment. 
Our platform is a fully integrated, end-to-end solution, comprised of proprietary consumables, including our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and advanced application and workflow software. Our platform leverages our proprietary OptoElectro Positioning (OEP) technology, which provides deterministic positioning of living single cells and other micro-objects using light. We believe our platform delivers a high level of control over, and preservation of, living single cells or other micro-objects throughout the functional characterization process. 
Our platform also uses our proprietary NanoPen technology. NanoPens are small, roughly 1 nanoliter (or 1/50,000th of a drop of water) sized chambers, with proprietary surface coatings that provide precise and deterministic control of the environment around the cells. Through biomimetic design, our platform provides nutrients to, and removes waste from, each NanoPen to keep the cells in a healthy state while outside of their native environment. These mechanisms enable performance of a large variety of single-cell assays on live biology, including single-cell real-time imaging at high resolution. 
OptoSelect chips 
Using OEP we select and move cells and other micro-objects in parallel into NanoPens on our proprietary OptoSelect chips. Within the NanoPens, our platform can precisely control the cell environment, perform a large variety of single-cell assays and real-time image each single cell, providing a predictable analytical window into live single-cell biology. We currently offer six types of OptoSelect chips, with different designs and numbers of NanoPens for various workflows. Our largest commercially available chip has 20,000 pens, and is primarily used for our antibody discovery workflow with plasma cells. OptoSelect chips are single-use consumables and replaced after each workflow. 
Reagent kits 
We have commercialized a broad range of reagent kits that have been validated in the workflows using our platform. These reagent kits support the on-chip analysis on our advanced automation systems as well as many other upstream and downstream processes. Our reagent kits provide a variety of capabilities and benefits, including: 
•Sample preparation; 
•Modification of the surface chemistry in our chips to enable both adherent and non-adherent cell culture; 
•Enhancement of the culture of single cells including prolonging cell life; 
•Media and media additives for primary cells and other cell types; 
•Assays, such as binding, blocking and functional; 
•Quantification of antibody production that are animal component-free; 
•Lysis and capture of a single cell’s specific genomic material in a NanoPen; and 
•Enablement of a wide range of other phenotypic and genotypic assays. 
In addition, our reagent kits have been optimized to support multiple species and cell types including mammalian cells such as B cells, T cells and dendritic cells, and non-mammalian cells including yeast and bacteria. 
Advanced automation systems 
We currently offer three advanced automation systems, Beacon and Lightning, which are designed to run our proprietary workflows, and Culture Station, which allows our customers to execute workflows requiring high volume, multi-day cell culture without breaking the continuity and control provisions of a single program run. 
Beacon 
Launched in December of 2016, Beacon is a fully automated, high throughput system that enables workflows on four OptoSelect chips in parallel, utilizing up to 80,000 NanoPens. Beacon captures brightfield and fluorescence images to track and assay individual cells across multiple points in time to allow Deep Opto Profiling of phenotypic and genotypic information on single cells. Beacon is used by our customers for high throughput applications, including antibody discovery and cell line development. Since its launch, we have focused on continuous improvement efforts in the form of activating additional system-level capabilities and enhancements, in turn, enhancing the value of the system for our customers. We will continue to evolve Beacon to further facilitate distributed decentralized biological processing globally. 
Lightning 
Launched in June of 2019, our Lightning desktop system supports workflows on a single chip. Lightning captures brightfield and fluorescence images to track and assay individual cells across multiple points in time and allows Deep Opto Profiling of phenotypic and genotypic information on single cells. 
Culture Station
Launched in January of 2020, Culture Station enables the on-chip culture of cells outside of Beacon and Lightning, where workflows require an extended cell culture period. Culture Station consists of independent media, fluidics and software and can be seamlessly integrated into Beacon and Lightning workflows. Rather than occupy those systems during the Culture module, customers can transfer up to eight of our OptoSelect chips from Beacon or Lightning onto Culture Station. Once culture is completed, the chips can be moved back to Beacon or Lightning for further analysis. This seamless interface between systems increases throughput when cell culture becomes a constraint. Parallel processing of culture while simultaneously running assays on Beacon or Lightning reduces the product development cycle time and lowers cost, maximizing benefits to our customers. 
Advanced application and workflow software 
Software is a core capability of Berkeley Lights and a key element of our platform. We believe that we have developed proprietary automation and analysis software that facilitates running our systems, as well as the analysis and reporting of the data from workflows far beyond what is possible with traditional manual workflows. Our software includes: 
•Cell Analysis Suite (CAS) is our premier and primary application. It is the platform management system software that is the foundation for all workflows run on Beacon and Lightning. CAS software controls the systems, acquires and analyzes data and directs all operations included in each automated workflow, including cell and NanoPen selection, on-chip immunoassay analysis, real-time single-cell imaging, automatic clone selection and removal from the NanoPens and exporting living cells. New versions of CAS are released over time to provide incremental improvements of the user experience and support new applications. 
•Workflow Runner/Builder is used to develop and run all of our workflows on our platform. It is used within our company as a development tool but also gives our customers the power to create, change, configure, save and automate complex workflows. Customers can customize workflows with the click of a mouse allowing for rapid workflow development and deployment. 
•Assay Analyzer provides analysis of the visual history of each cell in a NanoPen. Using the unique chip and NanoPen identification, the Beacon or Lightning user can conduct the analysis of assays, morphology, growth rates and other characteristics across all NanoPens. Using multi-dimensional graphs and filters, the user can select NanoPens of interest for export. Assay Analyzer also provides analysis and reporting, including complete images for proof of monoclonality useful for electronic records and regulatory reports. 
•Image Analyzer is a dynamic visualization application providing high resolution and real-time imaging of each NanoPen and its contents. Image Analyzer includes tools for optimizing cell counting, assay analysis and cell tracking over time, including particle counting for cells and beads, fluorescence identification of hits from positive assays, construction of high resolution images from fluorescence channels, cell scoring by color and recording of the imaging data. 
•PrimeSeq is an analysis and reporting tool integrating single-cell sequence library preparation into application-specific workflows. PrimeSeq can link sequencing files on each individual cell directly back to the specific NanoPen location for that cell. Using PrimeSeq and CAS, the Beacon and Lightning user can perform on-chip mRNA capture and reverse transcription, create single-cell sequencing libraries from select live single cells and explore phenotypic and genotypic information. 
Workflows using our platform: Import, Culture, Assay and Export 
Our customers have access to Berkeley Lights proprietary workflows, but can also develop and run their own customized workflows utilizing our Workflow Runner/Builder application software. 
Import 
Cells are imported to the OptoSelect chip through a microfluidic path. Once in the main channel, cells are imaged, and then moved into the NanoPens using OEP technology. 
The Import module begins after the customer loads the cell sample onto our advanced automation systems, and the system loads the sample into our OptoSelect chips. During the Import module, the customer uses our CAS software to select the cells and micro-objects of interest, and then our OEP technology is used to move the selected cells into NanoPens. This can be repeated multiple times so that, for example, a single NanoPen can be loaded with a bead, a cell to be interrogated and a reporter cell. Import can also be performed at various points during a workflow, for example, importing an antigen-specific bead during the Assay process. 
Culture 
Inside the NanoPens, cells can grow and divide under precisely controlled conditions. Our platform enables accurate control of the media around the cell to provide nutrients and remove waste products, allowing for optimal growth conditions. Additionally, our platform uses brightfield imaging of the cells, during the Culture module to track growth rate, cell diameter, circularity, motility and other morphological features in real-time. This module can also be run in parallel on Culture Station, without imaging, for higher chip throughput applications or when required cell culture times are long. 
Assay 
During the Assay process, each NanoPen is imaged in up to five fluorescent channels, monitored and the behavior of each cell collected digitally over time and across a range of parameters relevant to the desired application. Our platform can measure a wide range of surface markers, the rate of secreted factors, the functional responses of those secreted factors and cell-to-cell interactions. For example, using Import functions, our platform can place a tumor cell in the same NanoPen as a T cell and then using Assay functions, watch the T cell attack the tumor cell and digitally record the interaction including fluorescent markers that signal death of the tumor cell. We are also able to capture the mRNA of the single cell in each NanoPen for downstream sequencing applications. Using our OptoSeq Library Kits customers can lyse, capture and barcode genetic information from select cells on a single OptoSelect chip, conduct reverse transcription, create cDNA libraries for sequencing and link sequencing results back to the unique cell identifiers. 
Export 
Cells are exported from the OptoSelect chip to a well plate through a microfluidic path. Individual cells or clones of interest can be precisely selected with our OEP technology and exported into a 96 well plate for further processing. Our platform enables the selection and export of individual single cells and other micro-objects at any time during the workflow either to remove cells of interest for further processing or to export cells not further needed and continue Assay on cells of interest. Our platform can export live single cells, groups of cells and clones into a humidified and temperature controlled well plate. 
Business model and platform access 
Our business model is focused on driving the adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform and maximizing its use across our customers’ value chains. This is achieved by enabling more functional testing of single cells throughout our customers’ value chains and by finding opportunities for customers to perform single-cell functional testing earlier in their product development process to advance better product candidates. We engage with potential customers to identify a significant challenge they are facing and then evaluate which of our workflows and underlying assays can address their problem. Customers can gain access to our platform via direct purchase, subscription or strategic partnership. In many cases we can address customers’ needs with existing or variants of existing workflows. Alternately, we may form strategic partnerships to develop substantially new workflows with our customers to address their needs.

Our growth strategy 
Our goal is to establish the Berkeley Lights Platform as the standard throughout the cell-based product value chain and drive substantial conversion of current cell biology workflows onto our platform. Our growth strategy is comprised of the following elements: 
Drive new customer adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform 
Since the commercial launch of our platform in December of 2016 through December 31, 2020, 63 customers had leveraged our platform to perform a variety of workflows. We drive customer adoption globally within our initial target markets of antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology through business development efforts; a direct sales and marketing organization in the United States, parts of Europe and China; and third-party distributors and dealers in Asia. 
Expand the utilization of workflows across our customers’ value chains 
We are driving the adoption of workflows using our platform across our existing customers’ value chains. We are doing so by developing new workflows for use at multiple points within the discovery, development and production phases of our customers’ value chains. For example, customers that use our workflows for the antibody discovery phase may purchase our cell line development workflows to help within the development and production scale-up phases. 
Increase the value of our workflows to our customers 
We are increasing the value of our workflows by building additional assays that can be used with a given workflow and by further integrating the workflows into our customers’ existing processes. We are also expanding the upstream and downstream reach of our workflows. This increases the workflow value to our customers and enables us to share in that cost of ownership benefit. For example, we developed our Opto Plasma B Discovery 2.0 and 3.0 workflows to improve the features of Opto Plasma B Discovery 1.0. This was achieved by increasing scale and adding sequence library preparation into our workflow, making the process easier and more efficient for our customers and enabling them to more broadly screen the antibody diversity of animals. We have multiple generations of workflows for antibody discovery and cell line development, and are developing new generations of workflows, including for cell therapy development, incorporating additional capabilities that have value for our customers. 
Drive utilization of our workflows and adoption of our platform across multiple customer sites 
We increase usage of our platform with existing customers by driving adoption of multiple advanced automation systems either to support multiple locations or drive increased usage of our workflows in any given location. There is an opportunity to increase utilization of our platform throughout our customers’ organizations. We accomplish this through a combination of sales and business development efforts as well as through our customer success organization to help customers to standardize their processes globally at multiple sites using our platform. 
Develop and monetize proprietary biological assets from our BioFoundry 
Within our Berkeley Lights BioFoundry, we practice and validate workflows. In certain cases, we may use our own biology as part of this validation process. This enables us to commercialize new workflows and may also generate proprietary valuable biological assets we could sell outright or license to customers, such as functionally validated antibodies or new organisms applicable to synthetic biology. We also use our BioFoundry Innovation Lab in cooperation with third parties to develop workflows to generate proprietary biological assets for new and adjacent markets. These early third-party research collaborations may take various forms, including service or capacity subscription arrangements. 
Expand adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform into new markets 
Our market entry strategy involves identifying markets that have significant constraints which can be addressed by our platform. This can be specific to certain diseases or pathogens and/or involve new therapeutic modalities and/or cell types. We drive our expansion into new markets by developing workflows for those markets, either by adapting existing workflows or by partnering with leaders in those markets to develop workflows that address their significant unmet needs but also have general value for other customers in that market. These partnerships can result in joint development of specific workflows and assays involving upfront and milestone arrangements, as well as capacity subscription arrangements. Depending on the agreement, we could also negotiate end product revenue participation through royalties. 
Our workflow and assay library 
As of December 31, 2020, we offered eight commercial workflows, incorporating sixteen assays that address different phases of our customers’ cell-based product value chains in our target markets. In each of these markets we are developing additional workflows that can extend use of our platform across our customers’ value chains and perform single-cell functional testing at critical yield steps as early as possible in their respective processes. We are also developing workflows to enter new cell-based product markets. Workflow development and market expansion are a function of incorporating additional cell types, product specific assays or adapting the four basic workflow modules. 
We use our Berkeley Lights BioFoundry, which we believe represents the largest single location platform capacity globally for functionally characterizing cells, to drive new workflow development and functionally characterize cells. In our BioFoundry, we practice and develop workflows and functional assays that are applicable throughout the value chain of our target markets. Leveraging our BioFoundry’s capacity, we can also look deep into the immune repertoire to discover difficult-to-find proprietary biological assets, such as antibodies and TCRs, that may offer commercialization opportunities. 
The output of a workflow is to recover the best cells and best product candidate by recording critical data such as relevant phenotypic characteristics, genotypic information and multiple, high resolution images over time on thousands of cells, on an individual cell basis. This is a process we refer to as Deep Opto Profiling, a critical component of Digital Cell Biology. We believe Deep Opto Profiling delivers a significant amount of relevant phenotypic, genotypic and imaging information for each single cell, across a number of interconnected dimensions, allowing our customers to find the best cells for their desired product. 
Through our platform, customers can now link the Deep Opto Profiling data to each cell’s genomic expression. For example, some customers are using our platform to recover paired heavy and light chain antibody sequences and others are using our platform to capture mRNA from target cells for gene expression profiling. Customers can characterize the transcriptome of the highest producing clones. We expect that customers will be able to use this linked data to improve cellular models which may enable better organism design. We envision Deep Opto Profiling data will be aggregated and made accessible via the cloud to existing and new customers, which over time could become a part of our distributed biology strategy and our product offering. 
Antibody therapeutics workflows 
In the antibody therapeutics market, as of December 31, 2020, we offered six commercial workflows, four targeting the discovery phase and two targeting the development phase of this market. 
Opto Plasma B Discovery workflows versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 – These workflows enable customers to functionally characterize single B cells to discover antibody therapeutic candidates. We designed our Opto Plasma B Discovery workflows to provide access to the highest level of biodiversity and to discover rare functional antibodies that cannot be easily or cost-effectively found with other common methods, such as hybridoma, or methods that involve sequencing B cells first and performing functional testing later. Our Opto Plasma B Discovery workflows can deliver functional monoclonal antibody sequences in three days, which compares to weeks or months using common methods.
Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0—We adapted the modules and assays from our Opto Plasma B Discovery workflow 1.0 to enable recovery of antibodies from both immunized animals and human patients exposed to emerging and dangerous pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2. We developed reagent kits to process blood from patients surviving viral infection in order to find antibodies from both plasma and memory B cells against the virus. Using our platform, GenScript made an early discovery of binding antibodies in China against SARS-CoV-2. As part of our direct work on COVID-19, we have been collaborating with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to use Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 to discover therapeutic antibody candidates. This work has resulted in the discovery of hundreds of antibody sequences from a single recovering patient targeting SARS-CoV-2, two of those antibodies are in Phase 3 trials being conducted by AstraZeneca and in one study, this two antibody cocktail has shown to be effective against the dominant strain of COVID-19 and the two emerging UK and South African strains. We commercialized Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 in September 2020. 
While our recent efforts have been focused on SARS-CoV-2, we believe that Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 can be leveraged to discover potential therapies for many viruses and other emerging pathogens. The ability to process human patient samples provides access to the immune repertoire and antibodies that may represent therapeutic candidates for other infections suffered in the past. Previously, tapping directly into the human immune repertoire was not economically feasible because of the high costs associated with sequencing, re-expression and functional testing of thousands of cells. Our platform and Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 allow for upfront functional screening which makes accessing the repertoire economically feasible. 
Opto Cell Line Development versions 1.0 and 2.0—Following antibody discovery and antibody engineering, our Opto Cell Line Development workflows enable finding the highest productivity cell line by repeating the Culture and Assay modules on a small clone of 4 to 60 cells derived and grown from a single cell isolated on our chip. These workflows shorten the time to find the best production cell lines from 8 to 12 weeks for well plate-based approaches down to 1 week using our platform. Operation of a single large-scale bioreactor can cost approximately $50 million annually. The potential annual cost savings for finding a clone with just 20% higher titer could be on the order of $10 million per year per large-scale bioreactor. In certain cases, some customers have demonstrated even greater increases in titer. Our workflows also enable >99% monoclonality assurance, a quality metric important for regulatory approval, in the same workflow. By contrast, limiting dilution, a common method to provide monoclonality assurance, takes approximately four weeks and only achieves approximately 96% monoclonality assurance. One of our customers received the first Investigational New Drug, or IND, approval by the FDA for an Antibody Therapeutic developed using our Opto Cell Line Development 1.0 workflow on the Beacon. This means that our highly replicable, standardized, automated cell line development workflow with the associated automated data capture, including our industry leading monoclonality, is an accepted workflow for the creation of monoclonal cell lines.
Cell therapy workflows 
As of December 31, 2020, we offered two commercial workflows for cell therapy development. We are also developing our platform to serve as an integrated solution to develop and manufacture T cell therapies, as well as monitor a patient’s immune response to such therapies. 
Opto Cell Therapy Development workflow version 1.0—We announced version 1.0 in April of 2020, which enables customers to isolate, define and identify poly-functional T cells by precisely assembling T cell-target cell interactions in NanoPens. Our platform can selectively import phenotype specific T cells, cancer cells and cytokine capture beads into the NanoPens and co-culture them to determine what percentage of the T cell population demonstrates antigen-specific activation through multiple cytokine secretion measurements. Using this workflow, customers can also perform a time-lapse cytotoxicity assay in the NanoPens with T cells that have the ideal poly-functional cytokine phenotype to provide functional measurement of the T cell’s effectiveness in killing single or multiple tumor cells over time. It can be used to select specific T cells for TCR recovery and sequencing to accelerate the development of potential new cell therapies. With the Opto Cell Therapy Development 1.0, which includes the use of dendritic cells, our customers can evaluate thousands of individual T cells in parallel in a single day and on a single platform, and quickly derive actionable information on T cell function and then select and export the desired live cells for further downstream processing. 
Opto Cell Therapy Development workflow version 2.0—We have also released Opto Cell Therapy Development 2.0 which upgrades 1.0 to include upstream off-chip activation and expansion of T cells prior to on-chip selection, using multi-cytokine and cytotoxicity assays. Opto Cell Therapy Development 2.0 will eliminate the need for dendritic cells, which will reduce overall process variation, time and cost. 
Fully integrated cell therapy solution—We are developing workflows and a new advanced automation system to enable our platform to be deployed as a fully integrated solution for manufacture and therapy monitoring of cell therapies. In the first quarter of 2021, we announced that we had completed an alpha version of a fully integrated, closed loop, cell therapy manufacturing system, or CTMS. As part of the announcement we also stated that our CTMS is still early in the development cycle and any actual commercial use of the CTMS is likely several years away. We believe that these additions to our platform can address critical challenges and could enable the production of cell therapies on an integrated platform in a decentralized setting, close to the patient. 
Synthetic biology workflows 
In September of 2019, we signed a collaboration agreement with Ginkgo, a leader in the synthetic biology market, or the Ginkgo Agreement. Under the Ginkgo Agreement, Ginkgo has agreed to incorporate the Berkeley Lights Platform into its automated genetic engineering foundries. The collaboration will, among other things, drive jointly developed workflows that will help provide continued growth in output and efficiency of Ginkgo’s foundries and will establish our commercial workflow offering in the synthetic biology market. We are currently developing multiple workflows encompassing a variety of organisms with Ginkgo. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we exercised a buy-down right on two different collaboration workflows, which allows us to avoid a waiting period before commercializing the workflows for third parties.
Market opportunity 
While our platform is currently utilized primarily in the discovery and development stages of the value chain and marketed as research use only, or RUO, we believe that the capabilities of our platform will enable us to capture an increasingly greater share of our addressable market opportunity and the value chain across cell-based product industries, including being incorporated into the commercial manufacturing process. Our current workflows target customers in the antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology markets. We estimate that end market sales of cell-based products in antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology were approximately $148 billion in 2019 and are expected to grow to $255 billion by 2024 at an 11% CAGR. We believe there are approximately 1,600 companies, academic institutions, and governmental and other organizations currently focused on developing cell-based products and we estimate our total addressable market to be approximately $23 billion, which includes addressable markets of approximately $6 billion in antibody therapeutics, approximately $15 billion in cell therapy and approximately $2 billion in synthetic biology. Our estimates of our total addressable markets are based on potential customer research and development spending, addressable aspects of potential customers’ end product development process, and potential platform usage. We also utilize estimated penetration and placement rates for our platform with potential customers in our target markets and historical patterns for consumables usage. 
Antibody therapeutics market opportunity 
We believe traditional methods for antibody therapeutics discovery and development are lengthy and inefficient. According to a 2016 study by Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, developing a drug costs on average $2.6 billion. Development of a drug can also take an average 10 years to develop according to research published in 2015 by PhRMA. Furthermore, antibody therapeutics drug discovery and development are becoming more challenging as companies continue to pursue more complex drug targets, and use new modalities such as multi-specific antibodies. This rising complexity increases the time and cost of the pharmaceutical discovery and development cycle and puts further pressure on returns on investment in the antibody therapeutics industry. According to research published by the Deloitte Centre for Health Solutions in 2019, the top 12 biopharmaceutical companies ranked by research and development spend in 2009, saw their internal rate of return on research and development spend decline from 10.1% in 2010 to 1.8% in 2019. 
Plasma B cell antibody discovery workflow market opportunity 
The antibody therapeutics discovery process involves screening hundreds of thousands of antibody secreting cells to select a few final cell candidates to move into later stages of development. These cells are generally harvested from immunized animals that are having an immune response to the target disease being addressed. The response to any immunogen can vary wildly and, in certain cases, yield only a few cells that may secrete attractive antibody candidates for downstream development. Finding these rare cells is analogous to searching for a “needle in a haystack.” We believe that methods to rapidly functionally screen B cell repertoires are required to meet the demand for fast-paced therapeutic antibody discovery and that common methods are inadequate. The common methods for selecting candidates are characterized by high losses in biodiversity prior to functional screen for the desired antibody, or by skipping any functional screening before sequencing. This can increase the sequencing cost by hundreds of thousands of dollars and significantly extend the time for discovery of functionally validated candidates. The dilemma created by these two approaches is to either manage discovery and development cost in exchange for less biodiversity and yield, or to maximize biodiversity and yield, but increase time and costs. We believe the Berkeley Lights Platform addresses this dilemma and provides cost competitive access to the highest biodiversity yield and the shortest discovery time. 
Current methods and limitations 
Developed approximately 45 years ago, the hybridoma method remains the most common way to discover antibodies. However, we believe that the hybridoma method has significant inefficiencies. It generally takes approximately 8 to 12 weeks to complete a campaign and results in 99.9% process-based loss of the relevant immune repertoire at the beginning of the process. This biodiversity loss is particularly devastating for antibody discovery campaigns involving challenging immunogens, wherein the antigen specific repertoire is limited. This problem can be exacerbated if the starting cell sample is limited from the beginning, for example in the selection of plasma cells from human blood for antibodies. Furthermore, the hybridoma method generally is not used with certain cells such as lymph nodes or bone marrow, which contain some of the most attractive therapeutic candidates. 
More recently, the antibody therapeutics industry has been implementing a direct B cell sequencing method to circumvent the biodiversity losses in the hybridoma method. While this allows for capture of a large part of the immune repertoire, it requires a very large number of sequences to be re-expressed, including for cells that may not have the desired functional characteristics. This method requires a tradeoff between increased biodiversity capture and cost to re-express thousands of potentially non-functioning antibodies. Re-expression of a single sequence in a cell line costs hundreds of dollars, and when multiplied by thousands of sequences, the total cost becomes significant. 
Our platform performs early functional validation at the single B cell stage when the maximum immune repertoire is available. Our Opto Plasma B Discovery workflows discover functionally diverse therapeutic antibody candidates in days as compared to 8 to 12 weeks for hybridoma or approximately 5 to 8 weeks for direct B cell sequencing. One of our customers performed more than 15 hybridoma campaigns over multiple months and found only one hit, which turned out not to be a lead candidate. Using our platform to run our Opto Plasma B Discovery 1.0 workflow, the customer found over 200 hits. 
Antibody discovery for viral neutralization market opportunity 
Emerging viral pathogens are a threat to human life and the global economy. Rapid discovery and development of antibody therapeutics targeting emerging viral pathogens is a critical and unmet global need. As exemplified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, time required to develop a therapeutic is critical, and days matter. B cell-based antibody drug discovery targeting an emerging viral pathogen can begin as soon as a patient has recovered. Access to the blood of recovering patients, therefore, becomes of paramount importance. We believe there is a significant advantage to be able to deploy the Berkeley Lights Platform locally across the globe, to have proximity to the sites of initial viral infection. 
We created the Global Emerging Pathogen Antibody Discovery Consortium, or GEPAD, to attack COVID-19 and other emerging viral pathogens. Leveraging the Berkeley Lights Platform, including our Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 workflow, several consortium members engaged in rapid antibody discovery against emerging pathogens, including COVID-19. We believe our platform can use the blood of recovering patients as the foundation for therapeutics, with COVID-19 representing a first example. Our goal is to create the quickest therapeutic response to emerging viral pathogens globally. 
Opto Cell Line Development workflows market opportunity 
Once antibody product candidates have been discovered, the functionally confirmed lead candidates move through antibody engineering to cell line development for the identification of clonal lines capable of producing product antibody at low cost, high quality and scale. Customers in the antibody therapeutics industry, therefore, require stable, monoclonal production cell lines that produce high titers of antibody in their production bioreactors. The productivity of the cell line has a strong correlation to the production cost and output. 
We believe, much like the antibody discovery process, common cell line development methods are time consuming and laborious. In commonly used cell line development methods, the time from expansion through selection and cloning of production clones can take from 8 to 12 weeks. Our Opto Cell Line Development workflows find the high production cell lines in less than one week. 
Common cell line development methods employ well plate-based screening of Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cell transfections to identify potential candidate clones for scale up. Once the transfected and selected CHO cells are cloned into well plates and cultured for weeks, the antibody titer is measured. Although well plates poorly predict titer measurements in large scale bioreactors, they are often used as a low-quality tool for initial down-selection of the cells. Our platform enables functional productivity screening of thousands of individual CHO clones to find the best cells and we believe our platform does so faster and more efficiently than common cell line development methods. 
Cell therapy market opportunity 
Cell therapy is a rapidly growing biopharmaceutical market that holds significant potential, particularly in treating certain cancers. According to Evaluate Pharma, end market sales in cell therapy reached $1 billion in 2019 and are projected to grow to $14 billion by 2024 at a 68% CAGR. We are focused on, among other things, the development and manufacture of patient-specific, autologous cell therapies. These therapies are custom manufactured for each patient as compared to antibody therapeutics where a single therapy can serve millions of patients. To date, there are four FDA approved autologous T cell therapies for cancer, but there are hundreds of clinical trials underway. In a typical autologous cell therapy workflow, T cells are extracted from a cancer patient, genetically altered and manufactured in a centralized facility, and then returned and infused into the patient. 
Cell therapy is a newly emerging therapeutic modality, and many challenges to safety, efficacy and cost remain. Due, in part to the complexity and significant risk and side effects, cell therapies are only approved for patients with very advanced cancer. Given the compromised immune system of these patients has fewer capable T cells to begin with, finding and preserving the best cells to treat the cancer is essential. The critical challenges in this field are to keep the precious cells alive, dramatically improve cell characterization and reduce manufacturing time and the time to prepare the therapy for reintroduction to the patient. Today’s methods can take weeks from the time cells are taken from the patient until they are re-infused into the patient. The time and cell losses of cell extraction, labeling, freezing, shipping, receiving, identity verification, thawing, producing, analyzing, reformulating and reanalyzing, before freezing again, and shipping back to the point of care, make cell therapy adoption challenging. Centralization of these therapies, far removed from the patients, not only adds time but also requires freezing the cells. This leads to losses of very precious patient cells impacting the ability to manufacture the therapy. Finally, current cell therapies are expensive, limiting their broader use and availability.
We believe our solution has the potential to: 
•Improve the safety and efficacy of a cell therapy by improving monitoring and cell-based quality controls during manufacturing; 
•Utilize data to help determine optimal dosage; 
•Increase availability by scaling even minute usable T cell samples to therapeutically useful dosages; and 
•Improve manufacturing process and cycle time, resulting in a more predictable, timely therapy for patients. 
We believe there is a significant opportunity to simplify these methods with a closed, fully automated and self-contained cell therapy manufacturing system, decentralized, in closer proximity to the patient. We believe the expertise we have gained to manipulate, culture and interrogate cells can be leveraged to deploy our platform as a differentiated solution in this emerging market. 
Opto Cell Therapy Development workflow market opportunity 
Our goal is to accelerate the creation of better therapeutics by enabling multiple functional assays to be performed simultaneously on 1000s of individual T cells in a matter of days. The Opto Cell Therapy Development workflows are designed to measure critical quality attributes for cell therapies. Allowing therapeutic developers to deeply characterize, profile, and map T cell populations at the single-cell level to directly link cell behavior to gene expression and ultimately therapeutic efficacy. To find T cells likely to be effective in therapies, you’re looking for T cells with early, less-differentiated memory phenotypes that one, maintain their proliferative capacity in the presence of a tumor cell, which provides durable anti-tumor immunity. Two, exhibit polyfunctional cytokine secretion to mediate a wide breadth of immune mechanisms. And three, engage in serial killing behavior and are able to kill multiple tumor cells quickly. The Opto Cell Therapy Development workflows enable quantification of all these characteristics. For cytokine secretion assay, single antigen-specific T cells are cultured with tumor cells and cytokine capture beads. Then we stain with antibodies that detect the cytokine that’s been captured on the bead, as well as any cell surface markers of interest on the T cell. We can also measure cytotoxic activity from single T cells. Again, T cells are incubated with tumor cells, and in the media, we include a reagent that fluoresces when caspase 3 is activated. Using fluorescent time-lapse imaging, we can track the time point at which each T cell kills its tumor cell. We can measure the proliferation of single T cells by incubating a T cell with a tumor cell or bead, culturing for a period of time, and then imaging the chip to see the expanded T cells. Finally, we can export the cells for downstream analysis. These analyses could be performed at any point or at multiple points in the manufacturing process. In designing an end-to-end autologous cell therapy manufacturing system, we are embedding our OptoSelect chip-based analytics as a core capability.

Cell therapy manufacturing market opportunity
The currently deployed centralized method for T cell manufacturing is long and laborious, has many manual steps, and results in significant amounts of product variation and high cost. We believe that our platform can address critical challenges and enable researchers and therapeutic developers to cost-effectively discover, assess, develop and scale manufacturing of cell therapies on an integrated platform. 
We believe we can adapt our platform to accelerate the development path for cell therapies by automating and decentralizing the cell therapy manufacturing process. Our assays can measure the quality of the manufactured cell therapy product during the manufacturing process. We envision that cell therapies, enabled by our platform, can become defined, well-characterized drug products, manufactured in proximity to the patient, generally at a lower cost than currently approved therapies. 
We envision that each cell therapy treatment manufactured would be patient-specific and would require our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits on a per-patient basis. Once a cell therapy has received regulatory approval on our system, we could become the manufacturing process of record for these therapies moving forward. While a commercial version of our CTMS solution is still several years away, in the first quarter of 2021 we announced that we had developed an alpha version of our CTMS.
Cell therapy patient monitoring workflow market opportunity 
Careful monitoring of patients throughout the duration of cell therapy treatment, from preparing and considering treatment options to monitoring the long-term recovery of the patients post therapy, is a crucial success factor. Collecting source material is critical to the selection of the final cell therapy and to the manufacturing process. Because currently approved cell therapies are autologous, patients must be evaluated carefully before they become candidates for the cell therapy. 
We believe that immune monitoring of patients before and after cell therapy could be extremely valuable. Treatment options will be informed by the understanding of tumor microenvironments and mechanisms of patient specific immune-suppression by tumor. Our platform is highly efficient for extracting information from small cell samples. For example, samples from fine needle aspirates are usually recovered using an 18 or 22 gauge needle connected to a 1mL-2mL syringe barrel. This small volume contains very few cells and cannot be effectively run on a FACS machine or injected into a mass spectrometer. More importantly, neither FACS machines nor Mass Spectrometers can provide the functional assessments associated with cytokine release and cytotoxicity needed to determine if any T cell infiltration was associated with tumor cell killing. The Berkeley Lights Platform is well suited for processing these small and precious primary cell samples. By leveraging the cell therapy development assays from our Opto Cell Therapy workflows, we expect that we can quickly assemble workflows that will provide a functional assessment of an animal’s or a patient’s immune response in pre-clinical or clinical work, respectively. We believe this will further accelerate the rate at which lifesaving therapeutics can reach the market and to patients that need them. We also believe these workflows may have the opportunity to become companion diagnostics for cell therapies in the future. 
Our market research, comprised of interviews with academic and pharmaceutical industry participants, found that respondents were excited by the power of our technology, especially for use with fine needle aspirates and core biopsies. We found that there are many oncology sample access points, each with different pricing points. Based on a per sample price of thousands of dollars per sample, the immune profiling opportunity for Berkeley Lights could be hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Synthetic biology market opportunity 
According to BCC Research, the synthetic biology market had end-market sales of approximately $5 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2024 at a 29% CAGR. In synthetic biology, participants design and build millions of different strains per year from organisms, such as bacteria or yeast, by altering their genetic code. They then functionally test these millions of cells with different genetic alterations to find the best cells that not only produce the desired product, such as secreted proteins, enzymes and strains applicable to food, flavors, fragrances and materials, but do so in an economically viable way. 
Just as with cell line development in the antibody therapeutics market, cell productivity is measured by secretion, growth, response to changing media and other factors to select the best cells. Understanding the correlation of cell productivity to a full production scale fermenter early in the process directly impacts manufacturing costs and the profitability of the product. Once the desired productivity metric is achieved, our customers commence production of their target product. 
The synthetic biology process is characterized by three key steps: design, build and test. These three steps are continuously iterated to drive feedback into the design for the next iteration until the desired result is achieved. Using conventional methods requires significant time and capital. We expect iterations that take weeks using conventional methods are likely to be able to be completed in days using our platform. 
Synthetic biology discovery workflow opportunity
In line with our strategy of entering new markets through partnerships with established leaders, we demonstrated results from our Opto Plasma B Discovery 1.0 and Opto Cell Line Development 1.0 workflows to Ginkgo Bioworks, or Ginkgo. In September of 2019, we signed the Ginkgo Agreement with aggregate payments to us over the term of the agreement of up to $150 million with Ginkgo. 
Under the Ginkgo Agreement, Ginkgo has agreed to integrate the Berkeley Lights Platform into its automated genetic engineering foundries. The collaboration will drive, among other things, jointly developed workflows with the aim of continued growth in output and efficiency of Ginkgo’s foundries while expanding our commercial workflow offering and growth in this market. 
Unlike biopharmaceuticals, where the constraint is associated with expensive and long-lead times in pre-clinical and clinical work, most products in synthetic biology are, at this time, less regulated. The major constraint in this market is rapidly discovering economically viable strains that can produce the desired product specifications by design and at a level of efficiency to be cost competitive. Decreasing design, 
build and test cycle times while increasing correlation to large scale fermentation has a direct impact on the rate at which products can get to market and the manufacturer’s return on investment. Revenue opportunities for Berkeley Lights in synthetic biology are largely a function of new customers, number of organisms supported and overall number of products pursued by this industry. 
Commercial 
We commercially launched the Berkeley Lights Platform in December of 2016, which included Beacon and the alpha version of our Opto Cell Line Development 1.0 workflow targeting the antibody therapeutics market. From the initial launch of our platform through December 31, 2020, we have launched a total of eight commercial workflows and, in June of 2019, we launched our desktop Lightning system targeting assay development and lower throughput workflows. Our current workflows target potential customers across the antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology markets. This potential customer base is primarily comprised of companies developing biotherapeutics. As of December 31, 2020, our customer base was comprised of 63 customers and included several of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, as well as biotechnology companies, leading contract research organizations, synthetic biology companies and academic research institutions. 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed a commercial team of 85 employees, including 29 with Ph.D. degrees and many with significant industry experience. Of the 85 commercial employees, 37 were in business development, sales and marketing, while 48 were employed within our customer success organization, which is focused primarily on customer service and support efforts. As of December 31, 2020, our business development and sales teams included 23 employees, of which 17 were quota carrying sales representatives. We follow a direct sales model in North America, certain regions in Europe and China, while also selling through third party distributors and dealers in Asia. 
Our business model is focused on driving the adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform and maximizing its use across our customers’ value chains. This is achieved by enabling more functional testing of single cells throughout our customers’ value chains and by finding opportunities for customers to perform single-cell functional testing earlier in their product development process. We engage with potential customers to identify a significant challenge they are facing and then evaluate which workflows and underlying assays can address their problem. Customers can gain access to our platform via direct purchase, subscription, or strategic partnership. In many cases we can address customer needs with existing or variants of existing workflows. 
Alternately, we may form strategic partnerships to develop substantially new workflows with our customers to address their needs. 
Competition 
We face significant competition in the life sciences technology market. We currently compete with both established and early stage life sciences technology companies that design, manufacture and market systems, consumables, reagent kits and software for, among other applications, genomics, single-cell analysis, spatial analysis and immunology, and/or provide services related to the same. Growing understanding of the importance of single-cell information is leading to more companies offering services related to collecting such information. Our potential competitors include Danaher, Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Miltenyi Biotec and Sphere Fluidics Ltd., among others. Our target customers may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems, or using traditional methods, or engage a third party that provides a discovery service, rather than implementing our platform, and they may also decide to stop using our platform. In addition, there are many large established players in the life science technology market that we do not currently compete with but that could develop systems, tools or other products that will compete with us in the future. These large established companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces. 
For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see the section titled “Risk factors—Risks related to our business and strategy—The life sciences technology market is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability.” 
Manufacturing and supply 
We developed the Berkeley Lights Platform to create the most advanced environment for functional testing of single cells and provide customers local access to Digital Cell Biology for developing cell-based products on a global scale. Our platform is a fully integrated, end-to-end solution, comprised of our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and advanced application and workflow software. Our platform leverages our proprietary OptoElectro Positioning (OEP) technology, which provides deterministic positioning of live single cells and other micro-objects using light. We believe our platform delivers a high level of control over, and preservation of, live single cells or other micro-objects throughout the functional characterization process. 
Our manufacturing strategy relies heavily on third parties. Manufacturing of our systems, reagent kits and OptoSelect chip components is contracted out to third party contract manufacturers and suppliers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. We perform final assembly of our OptoSelect chips in-house. Our outsourced production strategy is intended to drive cost leverage and scale and avoid the high capital outlays and fixed costs related to constructing and operating a manufacturing facility. Certain suppliers of our components and materials are single source suppliers. For further discussion of the risks relating to our third party suppliers, see the section titled “Risk factors—Risks related to manufacturing and supply.” 
Consumables—OptoSelect chips and reagent kits 
We obtain all components of our OptoSelect chips from third party suppliers. While some components are sourced from a single supplier, we have qualified, or are qualifying, second sources for several of our critical chip requirements, as well as our reagent kits, and proprietary chip surface coatings. We believe that having dual sources for certain of our components helps reduce the risk of a potential production delay 
caused by a disruption in the supply of a critical component. We perform final manufacturing and assembly of our OptoSelect chips at our facilities in Emeryville, California. We outsource the manufacturing of many of our commercially released reagent kits to third party contract manufacturers. 
Advanced automation systems 
We rely heavily on third party contract manufacturers for production and manufacturing of Beacon, Lightning and Culture Station. Design work, prototyping and pilot manufacturing of our advanced automation systems are performed in-house before outsourcing to the third party contract manufacturers. We currently rely on Korvis LLC for the manufacturing of Beacon and Culture Station. For additional information on our supply arrangement with Korvis, see below under “Korvis supply agreement.” 
Korvis supply agreement 
In February of 2015, we entered into a supply agreement with Korvis LLC, or Korvis, which was subsequently amended in April of 2019, or the Korvis Agreement. The Korvis Agreement governs the terms and conditions of any purchase orders that we submit to Korvis for the manufacture of Beacon and Culture Station. Under the terms of the Korvis Agreement, Korvis will manufacture our products according to agreed-upon specifications. Korvis is required to maintain minimum manufacturing capacity of a specified number of Beacon systems per month. In addition, we may issue purchase orders in such volumes that require Korvis to maintain at least a specified minimum number of Beacon systems in its finished goods inventory. We are not otherwise obligated to issue a purchase order, and Korvis is only obligated to accept purchase orders for any specified number of products if the purchase order is consistent with a forecast and aligns with Korvis’s then-current lead times. The initial term of the Korvis Agreement was 24 months, after which the agreement automatically renews for successive 12-month terms unless we or Korvis provide written notice of intent not to renew at least 90 days’ prior to the end of the then-current term. Either we or Korvis may terminate the Korvis Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the agreement that is not cured with 30 days of the other party’s notice of such breach, (ii) upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency, or (iii) if, for any given consecutive 120-day period, both parties do not have any purchase orders outstanding and there is no finished goods inventory of Beacon systems being maintained by Korvis. 
The Korvis Agreement also includes negotiated provisions relating to, among others, delivery, inspection procedures, warranties, intellectual property rights, indemnification, and confidentiality.

In October of 2011, we entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, or the UC Agreement, with The Regents of the University of California, or the UC Regents, pursuant to which UC Regents granted us an exclusive (subject to certain non-commercial rights reserved by UC Regents and certain rights retained by the U.S. government, including so-called march-in rights), sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned by UC Regents related to optoelectronic tweezer technology to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize products, services and methods that are covered by such patent rights, or the Licensed Products.
We paid UC Regents upfront payments totaling $15,000 in connection with executing the UC Agreement. In addition, we issued an aggregate of 250,992 shares of our common stock, which had an aggregate fair value at the time of issuance of approximately $30,000, to certain persons associated with UC Regents upon the occurrence of a qualifying financing event. Additionally, we must pay UC Regents a sub-single digit percentage royalty on our net sales of Licensed Products that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to an annual minimum royalty payment owed to UC Regents of $10,000. We are also obligated to pay UC Regents a percentage of certain royalty income received from our sublicensees ranging from the low- to mid-teens.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed Products.
The UC Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent or last to be abandoned patent application that is licensed to us, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the UC Agreement. We may terminate the UC Agreement by providing advance written notice as specified in the UC Agreement. UC Regents may terminate the UC Agreement if we violate or fail to perform any term of the UC Agreement and we fail to cure such violation or failure within 90 days of notice thereof from UC Regents. Additionally, if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents, UC Regents may remove such patents from the scope of our license.
Government regulations
Our products and operations may be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, or local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, clearance, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-market monitoring and reporting, and import and export of medical devices. Our products are currently marketed as research use only, or RUO. 
RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product. The FDA will also evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization. 
Regulatory framework for medical devices in the United States 
Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic devices, or IVDs. IVDs that are marketed for RUO are not intended for use in a clinical investigation or for clinical diagnostic use outside an investigation and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for RUO and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices more generally, including the requirements for clearance or approval and compliance with manufacturing requirements known as the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. 
Although we currently market our products as RUO, we may in the future intend for them to be used for clinical or diagnostic purposes, or may develop other different products intended for clinical or diagnostic purposes, such as our in-development CTMS, which would result in the application of a more onerous set of regulatory requirements. Specifically, unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of an application for premarket approval, or PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees. 
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. 
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. 
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time-consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. 
After a device enters commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
•the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
•labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
•advertising and promotion requirements; 
•restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; 
•PMA annual reporting requirements; 
•PMA approval of product modifications, or the potential for new 510(k) clearances for certain modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices; 
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
•medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
•recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 
•an order of repair, replacement or refund; 
•device tracking requirements; and 
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions such as: warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; the FDA’s refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products; the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and criminal prosecution. 
It is also possible that in the future we develop a therapeutic that would be subject to different but also comprehensive FDA regulatory requirements. 
Human capital resources 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 230 full-time employees, with 89 in research and development, 85 in business development, sales, marketing and support, 24 in manufacturing and operations and 32 in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. 
Facilities 
Our corporate headquarters are located in Emeryville, California, where we lease and occupy approximately 77,844 square feet of space, which includes 34,789 square feet of space related to an operating lease we entered into on June 24, 2020 and that commenced on October 1, 2020. This lease, along with our existing leases, expire in March 2028. Additionally, we currently sublease 5,400 square feet of the space we occupy at our corporate headquarters pursuant to a sublease that expires in February 2022. We also lease and occupy approximately 2,702 square feet of office and demonstration lab space in Shanghai, China to support our China operations which expires in August 2023. We believe that such facilities meet our current and future anticipated needs.
