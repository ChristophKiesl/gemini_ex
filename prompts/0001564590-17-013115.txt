 Item 1. Business 
 Introduction 
 
We are a leading manufacturer, designer, and provider of consumer products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and an active participant in the hunting rifle market. We are also a leading provider of shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor products and accessories, including knives and cutting tools, sighting lasers, shooting supplies, tree saws, and survival gear.
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Smith & Wesson Corp., was founded in 1852 by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson. Mr. Wesson purchased Mr. Smith’s interest in 1873. The Wesson family sold Smith & Wesson Corp. to Bangor Punta Corp. in 1965. Lear Siegler Corporation purchased Bangor Punta in 1984, thereby acquiring ownership of Smith & Wesson Corp. Forstmann Little & Co. purchased Lear Siegler in 1986 and sold Smith & Wesson Corp. shortly thereafter to Tomkins Corporation, an affiliate of U.K.-based Tomkins PLC. We purchased Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins in May 2001 and renamed our company Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation. 
 In fiscal 2017, which ended April 30, 2017, we changed the name of our company from Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation to American Outdoor Brands Corporation to better reflect our expanding strategic focus on the growing markets for shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiasts. We believe that the name “American Outdoor Brands Corporation” better reflects our family of brands, our broad range of product offerings, and our plan to continue building upon our portfolio of strong American brands. We operate two businesses: (1) Firearms (which includes the Firearms and Manufacturing Services divisions) and (2) Outdoor Products & Accessories (which includes Accessories and Electro-Optics divisions). 
 In our Firearms business, which operates under the Smith & Wesson name, we manufacture a wide array of handguns (including revolvers and pistols), long guns (including modern sporting rifles, bolt action rifles, and muzzleloaders), handcuffs, and firearm-related products for sale to a wide variety of customers, including gun enthusiasts, collectors, hunters, sportsmen, competitive shooters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, law enforcement and security agencies and officers, and military agencies in the United States and throughout the world. We sell our firearm products under the Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, and Thompson/Center Arms brands. We manufacture our firearm products at our facilities in Springfield, Massachusetts, Houlton, Maine, and Deep River, Connecticut. We also sell our manufacturing services to other businesses in order to level-load our factories. We sell those services under our Smith & Wesson and Deep River Plastics brands.
 In our Outdoor Products & Accessories business, which currently operates under the names of Battenfeld Technologies, BTI Tools, Ultimate Survival Technologies, and Crimson Trace, we design, source, distribute, and manufacture reloading, gunsmithing, and gun cleaning supplies; high-quality stainless steel cutting tools and accessories; flashlights; tree saws and related trimming accessories; shooting supplies, rests, and other related accessories; apparel; vault accessories; laser grips and laser sights; and a full range of products for survival and emergency preparedness. We sell our outdoor products and accessories under the following brands: Caldwell, Wheeler, Tipton, Frankford Arsenal, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG-POD, Golden Rod, Non-Typical, Crimson Trace, Imperial, Schrade, Old Timer, UST, and KeyGear. We develop and market our outdoor products and accessories at our facilities in Columbia, Missouri, Wilsonville, Oregon; Kingsport, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida.

Our objective is to continue to enhance our position as one of the world’s leading firearm suppliers and expand our position as a provider of high-quality and innovative outdoor products and accessories for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets.
 Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective and deliver long-term shareholder value are as follows: 
  
• | design, produce, and market high-quality, innovative firearms, firearms and hunting accessories, and rugged outdoor products that meet the needs and desires of our consumer and professional customers;

 We estimate that the annual domestic non-military firearm market based on industry shipments is approximately $2.8 billion for handguns and $1.8 billion for long guns, excluding shotguns, with our market share in calendar 2015 being approximately 19.6% and 10%, respectively. According to 2015 reports by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the U.S. firearm manufacturing industry has grown at an 11% compound annual growth rate in units from 2010 through 2015. 
 The 2015 report issued by the Outdoor Industry Association, a leading trade organization for the outdoor industry, estimates that the annual U.S. domestic hunting and shooting market is approximately $16 billion, while the annual U.S. domestic outdoor recreation market is approximately $90 billion to $100 billion, which includes hunting and shooting, as well as camping, fishing, trail sports, and wildlife watching.

 Strategy 
 Our objective is to continue to enhance our position as a leading firearm manufacturer and to expand our position as a provider of high-quality outdoor products and accessories for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective are as follows:
Design, Produce, and Market High-Quality, Innovative Products
 
We are focused on designing, producing, and marketing high-quality, innovative products that meet the needs and desires of consumers and professionals while delivering long-term shareholder value. Our ongoing research and development, product engineering, product sourcing, marketing, and distribution activities are critical components 
 3



of our ability to offer successful products. A key element of this strategy is to localize the design and marketing teams at the divisional levels to ensure focus and creativity.
 
Increase Market Share in Markets in which We Participate
 
We continually seek to increase our market share in markets in which we participate. We seek to increase our market share in our core firearm business by (1) capitalizing on the goodwill developed through our historic 165 year old “Smith & Wesson” brand as well as our extensive portfolio of other well-known brands, such as M&P, Performance Center, and Thompson/Center Arms, (2) enhancing our relationships with key retailers, distributors, and buying groups and using our standard margin advantage to engage in competitive promotional activities, and (3)  introducing new products, especially in the polymer handgun market as represented by our M&P brand. During the last two fiscal years, we have introduced numerous new handgun and long gun models, including our M&P9, M&P40, and M&P45 M2.0; M&P45 Shield; M&P15 SPORT II; SW22 Victory .22LR; Performance Center ported M&P Shield pistols; and the T/C Compass. We plan to continue to introduce new firearm products in fiscal 2018.
 
We also seek to expand our market share in our outdoor products and accessories business with the ongoing introduction of new products that support the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets by (1) introducing innovative new products, (2) developing strong relationships with major retailers, including locating employees near major retailer headquarters, (3) leveraging our strong relationship with existing customers of our firearm business, (4) focusing our marketing efforts on digital activities to take advantage of the strong consumer push towards internet buying, and (5) capitalizing on our brands, such as Caldwell, Crimson Trace, Wheeler, UST, Schrade, Old Timer, Tipton, Smith & Wesson, M&P, Thompson/Center Arms, Frankford Arsenal, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG-POD, and others.
 Expand into Adjacent and Complementary Markets
 As we pursue expansion, we plan to continue to build our business around consumers that we already know through expanding existing relationships that have been built on brand loyalty and trust. Thus, we will seek to (1) enter market segments that match our core consumer’s passions for shooting, hunting, and outdoor activities, (2) acquire and create brands that are authentic, innovative, and differentiated in the market, (3) support and retain management teams that have an intimate understanding of the end consumer, a demonstrated track record of success, and a clear strategy for growth, (4) meet profitability goals by providing an acceptable rate of return within the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets, and (5) leverage existing relationships with potential strategic acquisition targets. In addition, our goal is to build our business in ways that allow us to optimize our current channel relationships, which serve our existing consumers, including distributors, large strategic retailers, buying groups, and internet retailers. 
Streamline and Standardize our Business Operations 
 A key activity associated with our inorganic strategy is to streamline and standardize certain administrative functions of our business in a shared services structure so that functions, including human resources, accounting, finance, program management, legal, compliance, environmental, health, and safety, or EH&S, and information technology, can be leveraged across multiple locations to achieve efficiency and improved internal controls. Such an approach includes investing in an integrated and configurable technology infrastructure in areas such as enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and compliance. During fiscal 2017, we continued to improve and enhance our ERP systems as we converted our Columbia, Missouri location to SAP. We intend to continue investing in our systems to further enhance our efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls. These system improvements include implementing SAP at additional facilities where we believe such an implementation would help us achieve these objectives. We intend to begin to convert our Wilsonville, Oregon facility to SAP in fiscal 2018.

We are also continuing our efforts to enhance our manufacturing productivity in terms of targeted increases in daily production quantities, increased operational availability of equipment, increased production flexibility to satisfy changes in demand, reduced machinery down time, extended machinery useful lives, reduced overtime, increased efficiency, enhanced product quality, and expanded outsourcing. We plan to continue to seek gains in manufacturing efficiency and capacity to ensure that we can meet customer demand for our most popular products.
 
Emphasize Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty
 We will continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering high-quality products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis and by offering customer service, training, and support.  We regard our high-quality, innovative products as the most important aspect of our customer satisfaction and loyalty, but we also offer customer service and support with various programs, such as toll free customer support numbers, email customer question and answer communications, broad service policies, and product warranties.

Pursue Acquisitions that are Synergistic with our Current Business
 We intend to continue to complement our internal growth by pursuing strategic acquisitions that will enable us to expand our product offerings by leveraging existing brands and adding new brands, penetrate adjacent and complementary markets, enhance our marketing and distribution, and enhance virtual integration especially when we believe we can improve their performance and profitability through the implementation of our operating methods, strategies, and shared services center structure. During the last three fiscal years, we have spent $371.5 million in acquiring companies and brands to grow in the outdoor products and accessories market. For example, in fiscal 2015, the DRP Acquisition was designed for vertical integration and the BTI Acquisition was designed to allow us to expand our presence in the accessories and outdoor products markets and to leverage BTI’s broad portfolio of hunting and shooting accessories brands. In addition, the BTI Acquisition allowed us to leverage key firearm brands, such as Smith & Wesson, M&P, and Thompson/Center Arms, to expand those brands into the accessories market with products, such as flashlights, and tools. In fiscal 2017, we acquired Crimson Trace Corporation, Taylor Brands, LLC, and Ultimate Survival Technologies, Inc., which allowed us to capitalize on established brands to expand into the electro-optics, knives, and survival and camping equipment markets, respectively.
 Firearm Products and Manufacturing Services 
 
General
 Our firearm products combine our legacy of 165 years of American manufacturing and engineering expertise with modern technological advances. We strive to leverage our tradition of innovation in materials, performance, and engineering, along with our proven history of reliability, to produce feature-rich, safe, durable, accurate, and high-performing firearms that satisfy the needs of our broad range of customers. Our introduction of new firearm products is intended to enhance our competitive position and broaden our participation in the overall firearm market. 
 We have substantially enhanced the breadth and quality of our portfolio of firearm products over the years. We have always been a leader in the revolver market. The introduction of our popular M&P branded pistol in January 2005 resulted in our company becoming one of the leaders in the polymer pistol market serving both the consumer sporting goods market and law enforcement agencies. The launch of our M&P branded modern sporting rifle in January 2006 has enabled us to capture what we estimate is the leading share of the modern sporting rifle market. The addition of our Thompson/Center Arms brand of hunting firearms and interchangeable firearm systems into our product portfolio in January 2007 also enhanced our long gun barrel manufacturing capabilities for our modern sporting rifles. We currently participate in three categories of the long gun market: bolt action rifles, muzzleloaders, and modern sporting rifles; and both core categories of the handgun market: semi-automatic pistols and revolvers. 
 All of our firearms are currently sold under our Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, and Thompson/Center Arms brands. Our customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; retailers; and consumers.

Our product development strategy is to understand our customers’ needs and then design and develop products to uniquely meet those needs. Throughout this process, we test multiple concepts with firearm owners and potential purchasers. We compare these test results against a growing database of prior concepts to identify those with the greatest market potential. Additional market research is completed to optimize the desired features and benefits. While this development process is ongoing, our launch timing for new products depends on market conditions to maximize sales across the entire product portfolio. In fiscal 2017, we launched several new products and product line extensions under our Smith & Wesson, M&P, and Thompson/Center Arms brands as well as several new products from our Performance Center. 
 
In fiscal 2017, we expanded our Smith & Wesson branded products to include short barrel versions of the Combat Magnum .357 and .44 revolvers for personal protection and added wood grips on several popular .357 and .44 Magnum revolvers. We also added product finishes and sights in our high value Smith & Wesson SD 9mm and .40 S&W pistol series. The Smith & Wesson 22 Victory pistol, introduced in fiscal 2016, was selected as the 2017 American Hunter Handgun of the Year by the National Rifle Association, or NRA, publications’ Golden Bullseye Awards.
 
In fiscal 2017, we expanded our M&P branded products with the introduction of our M&P M2.0, which is the first new product platform for our M&P pistol category since the introduction of the original M&P polymer model just over 10 years ago. The M&P M2.0 was introduced in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 Auto in the full size design, and we plan to continue to announce additional products and line extensions that will establish a broad family of products based on this new platform. The M&P M2.0 offers many enhancements over the original model, including a crisp trigger pull and a tactile, audible reset, as well as aggressive grip texture for enhanced control and four interchangeable dimensional palmswell grip sizes. We also introduced the M&P Shield pistol in the popular .45 Auto caliber. Since its introduction in 2012, the M&P Shield pistol has become one of the most popular concealed carry firearms in the market as demonstrated by the milestone shipment of the two millionth M&P Shield pistol in fiscal 2017.
 
Within our M&P branded products, we introduced several additions and enhancements to our popular M&P15 modern sporting rifle series. In the market-leading M&P15 SPORT II rifle series, we added Optics Ready and Magpul M-LOK handguard versions to offer the consumer further options to enhance their rifle with aftermarket accessories. The M&P15 Magpul Original Equipment series was enhanced with the latest Magpul SL slim line buttstock, pistol grip, and handguard with M-LOK and is available in three colors; black, flat dark earth, and stealth gray.
 Our customers continue to demand premium firearms that provide a competitive edge in sport shooting and hunting. Our Performance Center products are engineered and manufactured to meet this need with many custom features not found on our standard products, such as enhanced triggers for smoother trigger pull, ported barrels for better muzzle control, and specialty sights for quicker target acquisition.  During fiscal 2017, we expanded our Performance Center M&P pistols with the introduction of our M&P Shield in .45 Auto with factory ported slide and barrel. We also introduced our Performance Center M&P10 6.5 Creedmoor with a precision two-stage match trigger and a 15-inch free-float Troy Alpha Rail with M-LOK handguard, Magpul buttstock, and a pistol grip. 
 Within our Thompson/Center Arms branded products, we continued to focus on growing our bolt action rifle business while maintaining our leadership in muzzleloaders and interchangeable systems. The T/C Compass is an opening price point bolt action rifle available in 11 different calibers and featuring a free floating, threaded barrel that is available in two lengths based on caliber, as well as an adjustable trigger, and a removable rotary magazine. The Compass, as with all of our Thompson/Center Arms bolt action rifles, incorporates 5R rifling, which provides accuracy and bullet stability over multiple shots.  
 Our firearm business is seasonal with revenue generally peaking in our fourth fiscal quarter, which ends April 30, as a result of most industry events and distributor shows normally scheduled during the early spring months. In addition, because of our operating schedule, which includes a summer and a winter shutdown of our facilities, we have an increased number of operating days in our fourth fiscal quarter, which allows our shipping and production volumes to exceed other quarters. Seasonality, however, can be disrupted by external events that may drive sales or impact channel inventories, which may slow or accelerate our sales.

Our firearm net sales for the years ended April 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $773.0 million, $652.1 million, and $531.2 million, respectively. Firearm gross profit for the years ended April 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 totaled $314.6 million, $260.1 million, and $188.6 million, respectively. Total assets for our firearm business totaled $393.3 million and $458.1 million as of April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Reference is made to our consolidated financial statements, commencing on page F-1 of this report, for more information regarding our firearm business. 
 Sales of our handguns accounted for $556.6 million, or 61.6%, of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, $485.4 million, or 67.1%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, and $395.5 million, or 71.7%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. Sales of long guns accounted for $179.6 million, or 19.9%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, $127.6 million, or 17.7%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, and $90.2 million, or 16.3%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. Sales of other products and services accounted for $36.8 million, or 4.1%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, $39.0 million, or 5.4%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, and $45.0 million, or 8.2%, of net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. 
 Handguns 
 We currently manufacture an extensive variety of handgun models that include revolvers and pistols. A revolver is a handgun with a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of rotating chambers that are successively aligned with the barrel of the firearm during each firing cycle. There are two general types of revolvers: single-action and double-action. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the firearm and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder as it cocks and releases the hammer. A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. The firing cycle ejects the spent casings and loads a new round into the chamber. 
 We have long been known as an innovator and leader in the revolver market and most of our revolvers are currently marketed under the Smith & Wesson brand. We sell a wide range of sizes from small-frame, concealed carry revolvers used primarily for personal protection to large-frame revolvers used primarily for recreational and competitive sport shooting. Our extra-large frame revolvers are designed primarily to address the handgun-hunting market. 
 Our small-frame revolvers have been carried by law enforcement personnel and personal defense-minded citizens for 165 years. We hold a number of patents on various firearm applications, including the use of scandium, a material that possesses many of the same attributes as titanium but at a more reasonable cost. Our revolvers are available in a variety of models and calibers, with applications in virtually all professional and consumer markets. 
 We offer pistols under our Smith & Wesson, M&P, and Performance Center brands. Our full size and compact M&P pistol products have been engineered with input from professional users and are designed to offer performance, safety, and durability that meet the standards of global law enforcement and military personnel, as well as features attractive to consumers. We believe that our M&P branded pistol products are the most ergonomic, feature-rich, and innovative products on the market today. Our range of full size and compact M&P pistol products are made with a polymer frame, a rigid stainless steel chassis, and a black, through-hardened corrosion resistant finished stainless steel barrel and slide for durability. Our M&P pistol products feature patented and easily changed palmswell grips in three or four sizes, allowing the user to customize grips in a matter of seconds; a passive trigger safety to prevent the pistol from firing if dropped; an enlarged trigger guard to accommodate gloved hands; a sear lever release that eliminates the need to press the trigger in order to disassemble the firearm; an ambidextrous slide stop and reversible magazine release to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters; an optional internal locking system and magazine safety; and a universal equipment rail to allow the addition of accessories, including lights and lasers. 
 In fiscal 2012, we launched the M&P Shield pistol to address the growing personal protection and concealed carry market. The M&P Shield features a slim concealable profile, 9mm, .40S&W, and .45 Auto calibers, and M&P ergonomics. We introduced additional M&P Shield models during fiscal 2017. We consider the M&P Shield pistol to be one of the most popular firearms in the market, having surpassed the two millionth unit shipped in fiscal 2017. 
 Our Performance Center has been providing specialized products and services for the most demanding shooting sports enthusiasts since 1990. To meet the requirements of law enforcement professionals, competitive 
 7



shooters, collectors, and discriminating sport enthusiasts who demand superior firearm products, our Performance Center personnel conceptualize, engineer, and craft firearm products from the ground up. Our craftsmen, many of whom are actively involved in competitive shooting, are highly skilled and experienced gunsmiths. Performance Center products are offered under both the Smith & Wesson and the M&P brands and are typically made in limited production quantities, although we offer a number of catalog variations in order to enhance product availability. 
 Our “Classics” department makes it possible to own historic firearms that are manufactured today but modeled after original favorites, such as the Model 29, the firearm made famous by the movie character Dirty Harry. These firearms are newly crafted with designs that take advantage of some of the most famous and collectible guns that we have ever made. Our Classics department also makes commemorative firearms and employs master engravers to craft one-of-a-kind custom firearms. These custom-made applications reflect the skill and vision of the master engraver and the artistic expression of the owner. We offer a number of catalog variations of Classics and engraved Classics to our customers. 
 Long Guns 
 Our M&P branded modern sporting rifles are specifically designed to satisfy the functionality and reliability needs of global military, law enforcement, and security personnel. As a result, these long guns are popular with consumers as hunting and sporting target rifles and are sold through our sporting good distributors, retailers, and dealers. We offer M&P modern sporting rifles in five different calibers (.22LR, 5.56mm NATO (.223), .300 Whisper, .308 Winchester (7.62x51mm), and 6.5 Creedmoor) for multiple recreational and professional uses. We also offer upper assemblies so gun owners can easily modify their M&P to suit the needs and tasks of the various forms of sport shooting and hunting. Our broad product portfolio of modern sporting rifles includes a .22 caliber model, an opening price-point sport model, a hunting caliber for longer range effectiveness, and several models designed for the exclusive use of military and law enforcement agencies throughout the world. 
 We manufacture three lines of bolt-action rifles under our Thompson/Center Arms brand consisting of several models in each line. These long guns are offered in up to 16 different calibers. Bolt-action rifles operate by the cycling of a bolt handle that allows for both the loading and unloading of rounds via a magazine fed system. This design allows for multi-round capacity and a level of strength that permits larger calibers. Bolt-action rifles are the most popular firearm among hunters because of their reputation for accuracy, reliability, and relatively light-weight design. 
 Under our Thompson/Center Arms brand, we also offer five lines of high-quality American-made single-shot “black powder,” or “muzzleloader,” firearms. Ammunition for our black powder firearms are loaded through the muzzle rather than the breech, as is the case with conventional firearms. Our black powder firearms are highly accurate, dependable rifles configured with muzzleloading barrels for hunting. Black powder firearms are purchased by hunting enthusiasts, primarily for use during exclusive black powder hunting seasons for hunting big game, such as deer and elk. 
 We offer two models of interchangeable, single-shot firearm systems that deliver numerous gun, barrel, caliber configurations, and finishes. These firearm systems can be purchased fully assembled or as frame assemblies that can be configured by the owner as a center-fire rifle, rim-fire rifle, shotgun, black powder firearm, or single-shot handgun for use across the entire range of big- and small-game hunting. As a result, a firearm owner can easily change barrels, stocks, and forends, resulting in “one gun for all seasons” that can be continuously modified to suit the needs and tasks of the owner for various forms of sport shooting and hunting. 
 Other Firearm Products and Manufacturing Services 
 Our other firearm products and manufacturing services include the following: 
 Parts: We sell parts to support our firearm business, including barrels and magazines that are manufactured at our facilities or purchased through third parties. 
 Handcuffs: We are one of the largest manufacturers of handcuffs and restraints in the United States. We fabricate these products from the highest grade carbon or stainless steel. Our patented Lever Lock cuffs offer a new, 
 8



double-locking system for added security and comfort, without extra tools or keys. Double heat-treated internal locks help prevent tampering and smooth ratchets allow for swift cuffing and an extra measure of safety. We have the ability to customize handcuffs to fit customer specifications. 
 Smith & Wesson Academy: Established in 1969, the Smith & Wesson Academy is the nation’s oldest private law enforcement training facility. The Smith & Wesson Academy has trained law enforcement personnel from all 50 states and more than 50 foreign countries. Classes are conducted at our facility in Springfield, Massachusetts or on location around the world. Through the Smith & Wesson Academy, we offer state-of-the-art-instruction designed to meet the training needs of law enforcement and security customers worldwide. 
 Manufacturing Services: We utilize our substantial capabilities in metal processing and finishing to provide services to third-party customers. Our manufacturing services include forging, heat treating, finishing, plating, and plastic injection molding. We believe that business-to-business sales adds revenue stream diversification and helps to level-load production in our manufacturing plants. Our manufacturing services business expanded with the fiscal 2015 acquisition of Tri-Town Plastics, Inc., or TTPP, a provider of custom injection molding services, rapid prototyping, and tooling, and renamed the business Deep River Plastics. The company was a long-standing supplier of polymer frames and related components for a large number of our firearms, including nearly all of our popular M&P models. The acquisition of Deep River Plastics was designed to vertically integrate a key component of our manufacturing operations and provide us with increased flexibility and reduced risk within our supply chain.  
Outdoor Products & Accessories
 We are a provider of outdoor products and accessories used in the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. We design, source, distribute, and manufacture innovative, high-quality products under 19 brands in two divisions: Accessories and Electro-Optics. In addition, we recently hired an executive to establish a third division to explore inorganic opportunities in the outdoor recreation market. 
 In our Accessories division, we offer an extensive array of products, including shooting and field rests, gunsmithing tools, knives and cutting tools, gun vises, hearing protection, camping and survival gear, case tumblers, and vault accessories. Since 2011, we have introduced over 440 variations of accessories products and currently holds over 40 patents. Our Accessories division has grown primarily through organic initiatives focusing on new product introductions each year but has also grown through strategic acquisitions. Our brand portfolio includes the highly regarded Caldwell line of shooting supplies, which has provided shooting accessories for more than 16 years. We also sell products under other brand names, including Wheeler, Tipton, Frankford Arsenal, Schrade, Imperial, Uncle Henry, UST, KeyGear, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG-POD, and Golden Rod. Finally, several of the registered trademarks in our firearm business, including the S&W logo, the script “Smith & Wesson”, the “M&P” logo, the script “Thompson/Center Arms” and the script “Performance Center” are well known and have a reputation for quality, value, and trustworthiness in the accessories industry. As a result of the sourcing and development skills of the Accessories division, we have reduced our licensing activity and are internally developing and marketing products using those strong brands. 
 As noted above, we have built the Accessories division both organically and inorganically. In fiscal 2015, we acquired BTI, a leading provider of hunting and shooting accessories, which was designed to expand our presence in the firearm accessories and rugged outdoor markets and leverage BTI’s broad portfolio of hunting and shooting accessories brands that are popular with consumers. In fiscal 2017, we expanded our Accessories division by acquiring the net assets of Taylor Brands, LLC and Ultimate Survival Technologies, Inc. Taylor Brands, LLC, based in Kingsport, Tennessee, now operating as BTI Tools, LLC, is a designer and distributor of high-quality knives, specialty tools, and accessories and a licensee of our wholly owned subsidiary, Smith & Wesson Corp. Ultimate Survival Technologies, Inc., based in Jacksonville, Florida, now operating as UST, LLC, is a provider of high quality survival and camping equipment, including LED lights, all-weather fire starters, unbreakable signal mirrors, premium outdoor cutting tools, first aid kits, survival kits, and camp kitchen products. 
 Unlike our firearm business, which is a manufacturing and sales operation, our accessories business model is to design, source, and distribute products focusing on product innovation and highly efficient component-level overseas sourcing. Our Accessories division maintains long term relationships with key industry accounts and 
 9



utilizes a highly efficient digital advertising and marketing approach. We typically launch well over 150 new accessories SKUs every year. 
 In fiscal 2017, we established our Electro-Optics division with the acquisition of the stock of Crimson Trace Corporation, a leader in laser sighting and tactical lighting systems and an important supplier to our firearms business. Founded 22 years ago, Crimson Trace had generated a ten-year compound annual growth rate in revenue of more than 10% as of the date of the acquisition. Although Crimson Trace has been narrowly focused on the laser sighting market, we view the electro-optics market in its entirety, and with its robust new product development capability and market leadership position, we believe Crimson Trace provides a solid framework for growth. This is a broad and sizeable product category that includes sights, aiming and ranging devices, magnifiers, and scopes for a variety of applications. 
 As previously noted, we hired an executive to establish our new Outdoor Recreation division. His focus will be on identifying acquisition opportunities in camping, hiking, fishing, paddling, and archery. 
 Our Outdoor Products & Accessories net sales were $130.2 million, or 14.4%, of total net sales for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017; $70.8 million, or 9.8%, of net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016; $20.6 million, or 3.7%, of net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. Fiscal 2017 includes net sales pertaining to BTI Tools, Crimson Trace, and UST for the periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. Fiscal 2015 includes net sales pertaining to BTI for the period subsequent to December 11, 2014, the date of the BTI Acquisition. Our Outdoor Products & Accessories gross profit for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 totaled $60.7 million, $33.7 million, and $6.4 million, respectively. Total assets for our outdoor products and accessories business totaled $394.7 million and $161.5 million as of April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution 
 General 
 We go to market in a variety of ways in firearms including two-step distribution, strategic retailers, and buying groups consisting of certain large, regional retailers utilizing a combination of direct sales and sales representatives to service these customers. We also sell firearms directly to law enforcement agencies and manufacturing services directly to other businesses. In Outdoor Products & Accessories, we go to market through two-step distribution, strategic retailers, and direct-to-dealer sales utilizing a combination of direct sales and sales representatives. We sell internationally primarily through distributors, which in turn sell to retail stores and government agencies. Our top five commercial distributors in the United States accounted for a total of 37.3% and 34.1%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Those commercial distributors are not regionally exclusive and have many of the same dealer customers. Therefore, we believe that the loss of one or more of these distributors would not materially impact sales as the remaining distributors would be allocated additional sales. 
 We market our products to consumers primarily through independent dealers, large retailers, in-store retail channels, and range operations utilizing consumer-focused product marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print, broadcast, and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; and in-store retail merchandising systems and strategies. We are also an industry leader in vertical print media as gauged by our regular tracking of editorial coverage in numerous outdoor magazines, including such leaders as Guns & Ammo, American Rifleman, Shooting Times, American Handgunner, Shooting Illustrated, Outdoor Life, American Hunter, and Field & Stream. We also sponsor numerous outdoor television, internet, and radio programs that generate significant editorial exposure. 
 We sponsor a significant number of firearm safety, shooting, and hunting events and organizations. We print various product catalogs that are distributed to our dealers and mailed directly, on a limited basis, to consumers. We also attend various trade shows, such as the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show, the NRA Annual Meeting & Exhibits, the National Association of Sporting Goods Wholesalers Show, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Show, the Association of the United States Army Show, or AUSA Show, the International Weapons Exhibition Show, or IWA Show, in Europe, and various distributor, buying group, and consumer shows. 
 For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, advertising and promotion expenses were $22.3 million, $21.8 million, and $20.2 million, respectively, excluding the cost of rebates and promotions reflected 
 10



in gross profit. The increase in advertising and promotion expenses was due to the businesses acquired in fiscal year 2017. 
 We sell our products worldwide. International sales accounted for 3%, 3%, and 4% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our Firearms and Outdoor Products & Accessories businesses own tooling that is located at various suppliers in Asia and North America.  
 E-Marketing 
 We utilize our websites, including www.aob.com, www.smith-wesson.com, www.tcarms.com, www.btibrands.com, www.crimsontrace.com, www.ustbrands.com, www.taylorbrandsllc.com, www.swgear.com, and www.keygearproducts.com, to market our products and services and to provide a wide range of information regarding our company to customers, consumers, dealers, distributors, investors, and government and law enforcement agencies worldwide. We utilize e-marketing, including social and digital marketing such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and e-blasts to our consumer and trade customers to provide additional product and service information to such customers. 
 Retail 
 We operate online retail stores from which we sell hunting, camping, and shooting accessories under all of our brands. Firearms are not sold through the online retail stores. 
Service and Support 
 Our Firearms division utilizes a toll free customer service number and offers a customer service e-mail option to answer questions and resolve issues regarding our firearm products. In addition, we offer a limited one year warranty program and a lifetime service policy under which we repair defects in material or workmanship in our firearm products without charge for as long as the original purchaser owns the firearm. We also maintain a number of authorized warranty centers throughout the world and provide both warranty and charge repair services at our facilities.
 Our Accessories division utilizes a toll free customer service numbers to answer questions and resolve issues regarding our accessories products.  We offer a limited one year or a limited lifetime warranty program to the original purchaser of our accessories products, depending on the product purchased.
 Our Electro-Optics division also operates a toll free number and offers a warranty that our products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of three years from the original retail purchase. We also will repair or replace with an item of equivalent value, at our option, any product or part that is found to be defective under normal use and service, without charge during the warranty period. 
 Facilities 
 We have three manufacturing facilities at which we produce our firearm products: a 575,000 square-foot facility located in Springfield, Massachusetts; a 38,000 square-foot facility located in Houlton, Maine; and a 150,000 square-foot facility located in Deep River, Connecticut. We conduct our handgun and long gun manufacturing and some of our manufacturing service activities at our Springfield facility. Our Houlton facility is a machining center only with no assembly, finishing, or small parts operations. We also continue to produce handcuffs and other restraint devices at our Houlton facility. Our Deep River facility is utilized for custom plastic injection molding services, rapid prototyping, and tooling. All of these facilities are ISO 9001 certified.
 We perform in our own facilities most of the machining and all of the assembly, inspection, and testing of the firearms that we sell. We produce our major firearm components utilizing computer-assisted machines. Our skilled employees utilize sophisticated automated testing equipment to ensure the proper functioning of our firearms. Every firearm is test fired before shipment. Our Springfield and Houlton facilities are currently operating on two shift patterns; a four shift, 168 hour per week schedule and a three shift, 120 hour per week schedule. We seek to minimize inventory costs through an integrated planning and production system. All facilities in our Firearms 
 11



division operate under a fully integrated ERP system, SAP. We intend to continue investing in improving our facilities and our systems in order to enhance efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls. 
 Our Accessories division operates three facilities, each of which consists of a warehouse and connected office space: a 145,000 square foot building in Columbia, Missouri; a 160,000 square foot building in Kingsport, Tennessee; and a 100,625 square foot building in Jacksonville, Florida. We source almost all of our outdoor accessories from third-party contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia. Each of these facilities is ISO 9001 certified. During fiscal 2017, we transitioned the Columbia facility to SAP.
 Our Electro-Optics division operates a 50,000 square foot light manufacturing, assembly, and warehousing facility with connected office space in Wilsonville, Oregon. We source laser diodes from Asia and most other component parts from North America. We intend to transition that facility to SAP in fiscal year 2018. 
 In fiscal 2017, we announced a plan to establish a national distribution center in Boone County, Missouri. We plan ultimately to rely on this distribution facility for substantially all of our product distribution. Under the plan, we expect to break ground on our new 500,000 square foot facility in the next several months. Our plan to establish the new facility in Boone County is contingent upon the approval of incentives, completion of due diligence, and the finalization of agreements related to other terms and conditions.
 Suppliers 
 We manufacture most of the components for our firearms, but purchase certain components and parts, including bolt carriers, rifle receivers, magazines, slides, small parts, barrels, and rifle stocks, from third parties. We also purchase ammunition for product testing. Most of our major suppliers for our Firearms division products are U.S.-based and provide materials, components, and parts, such as raw steel, polymer components, and metal-injected-molded components. The costs of these materials, components, and parts are at competitive rates. We have become increasingly dependent on a small number of key vendors that supply components and parts for our firearms as a result of our decision to enhance our manufacturing flexibility by using third parties that can supplement our internal capacity to better react to changes in market conditions. We also use numerous raw materials, such as steel, wood, lead, brass, and plastics, in producing and testing our products. We have alternative sources for these raw materials. 
 Most of the major suppliers for our Accessories division products are based in Asia, although a portion of our products are produced and assembled in the United States. The Accessories division continues to expand its supply base in order to maintain competitive pricing and respond rapidly to changes in customer demand and market trends. Major suppliers for our Electro-Optics division are primarily located in Asia and North America and provide diodes, circuit boards, and plastic injection molded parts for our products. The Electro-Optics division utilizes a dual sourcing supply chain in order to mitigate risks associated with sourcing key components from only one supplier.       
 Research and Development; New Product Introductions 
 Through our advanced products engineering departments, we enhance existing products and develop new products for all of our businesses. In fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, our gross spending on research activities relating to the development of new products was $10.2 million, $10.0 million, and $6.9 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2017, we had 65 employees at our various facilities engaged in ongoing research and development activities for all of our brands. 
Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights 
 We recognize the importance of innovation and protecting our intellectual property. Accordingly, we own numerous patents related to our products. We apply for patents whenever we develop innovative new products, unique designs, or processes of commercial importance. We do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent. 
 12



Because of the significance of our brand names, our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and copyrights are also important to our business. We have an active global program of trademark registration, monitoring, and enforcement. We believe that our Smith & Wesson, M&P, Performance Center, and Thompson/Center Arms brands and our S&W monogram trademarks are known and recognized by the public worldwide and are important to our firearm business. In addition, we market our outdoor products and accessories under 19 brand names, including Caldwell, Crimson Trace, Schrade, Uncle Henry, Imperial, UST, Key Gear, Wheeler, Tipton, Frankford Arsenal, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG-POD, and Golden Rod, among others. We also sell outdoor products and accessories utilizing our firearm brands.   
 We intend to vigorously pursue and challenge infringements of our patents, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and copyrights, as we believe the goodwill associated with them is a cornerstone of our branding strategy. 
 Competition 
 We encounter competition in the firearms industry from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Some competitors manufacture a wide variety of firearms as we do, while the majority of our competitors manufacture only certain types of firearms. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and are an active participant in the hunting rifle market. We compete primarily based upon innovation, quality, reliability, durability, price, performance, consumer brand awareness, and customer service and support. Our customer service organization is proactive in offering timely responses to customer inquiries. We believe we can effectively compete with all our present competitors. 
 Our primary competitors are Ruger and Taurus in the revolver market and Glock, Ruger, Sig Sauer, and Springfield Armory in the pistol market. We compete primarily with Colt, Sig Sauer, Ruger, Bushmaster, Daniel Defense, and DPMS in the modern sporting rifle market and Browning, Marlin, Remington, Ruger, Savage, Weatherby, CVA, Traditions, and Winchester in the hunting rifle market. 
 Our competitors in the outdoor products and accessories markets are not as clearly defined as the firearms market because of the broad range of brand names and products. Our primary competitor in the accessories market is Vista Outdoors. Almost all of the other competitors are smaller private companies that directly compete with only one or two of our brands. The primary competitors for our Electro-Optics division are LaserMax, Viridian, and Laserlyte. 
 Customers 
 We sell our firearm products through a variety of federally licensed distribution channels. Depending upon the product or service, our firearm customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; retailers; and consumers. Our outdoor products and accessories customers consist primarily of internet retailers, distributors, traditional retailers, and consumers. The ultimate users of our firearm and outdoor products and accessories include shooting and outdoor enthusiasts, collectors, sportsmen, competitive shooters, hunters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, law enforcement and military personnel and agencies, and other government organizations. 
 We grant payment terms to most commercial customers ranging from 30 to 90 days. However, in some instances, we provide longer payment terms, particularly as it relates to our hunting dating programs. 
 During fiscal 2017, firearm sales into our professional channel comprised 8.8% of our firearm net sales which include state and local law enforcement agencies, the federal government, and international customers. The remaining 91.2% of our firearm net sales were through federal firearm licensees to domestic consumers. Net sales for Outdoor Products and Accessories products during fiscal 2017 were 4.5% to international customers and 95.5% to domestic customers. Our domestic net sales are made to E-commerce retailers, strategic retailers, dealers, and distributors that sell to licensed dealers that in turn sell to the end users. In some cases, we sell directly to large retailers and dealers.
 13



Governmental Regulations 
 Our firearm business is primarily regulated by the ATF, which licenses the manufacture, sale, and import of firearms in the United States. The ATF conducts periodic audits of our facilities that hold Federal Firearms Licenses. The U.S. Department of State currently oversees the export of articles, services, and related technical data that are designated as defense articles or defense services on the U.S. Munitions List, as set forth in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, under the Arms Export Control Act, or AECA. We are required to obtain an export permit for all international shipments of items controlled under ITAR and AECA. 
 There are also various state laws, regulations, and local ordinances relating to firearm characteristics, features, and sales, as well as firearm magazine capacities. Local firearm dealers must comply with state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances pertaining to firearm and magazine sales within their jurisdictions. We manufacture several firearm models and magazines in various capacities that comply with those laws, regulations, and ordinances for sales in those states and localities. In Massachusetts, for example, there are regulations related to the weight of the trigger pull, barrel length, material strength, and independent testing of handguns. California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, as well as other states, the District of Columbia, and other localities, have similar laws, ordinances, and restrictions. In addition, California requires new pistols to contain a microstamping mechanism, which must be able to etch or imprint, in two locations, a microstamp array of characters that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistols onto each cartridge case when the pistol is fired. No commercially produced firearm has utilized the microstamping process, which is considered by most to be unfeasible, and we have no plans to utilize any microstamping feature in our firearms. Therefore, we will not sell into California any pistol that is subject to the microstamping feature requirement. 
 Warnings and instructions concerning the safe operation of our firearms are contained in Safety & Instruction Manuals included in all boxes in which firearms are shipped and are also available for download from our Smith & Wesson and Thompson/Center Arms websites.
 Our outdoor products and accessories businesses are subject to various standard business regulations of the kind that typically apply to all companies whose products are used by consumers.
 Environmental Health and Safety 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations that regulate the health and safety of our workforce, including those regulations monitored by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, or OSHA, the National Fire Protection Association, and the Department of Public Health. Though not exhaustive, examples of applicable regulations include confined space safety, walking and working surfaces, machine guarding, and life safety. 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata and water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. These laws require us to make significant expenditures of both a capital and expense nature. Several of the more significant federal laws applicable to our operations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA; and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA. 
 We are required to remediate hazardous waste at our facilities. Currently, we own a designated site in Springfield, Massachusetts that contains two release areas, which are the focus of remediation projects as part of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, or MCP. The MCP provides a structured environment for the voluntary remediation of regulated releases. We may be required to remove hazardous waste or remediate the alleged effects of hazardous substances on the environment associated with past disposal practices at sites not owned by us. We have received notice that we are a potentially responsible party from the Environmental Protection Agency and/or individual states under CERCLA or a state equivalent at two sites. 
 14



In our efforts to satisfy our environmental responsibilities and to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have established, and periodically update, policies relating to the environmental standards of performance for our operations. We have in place programs that monitor compliance with various federal, state, and local environmental regulations. However, in the normal course of our manufacturing operations, we are subject to governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to waste disposal, air emissions, and water discharges from our operations into the environment. We regularly incur substantial capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws, including remediation of known environmental conditions which we fund through cash flows from operations. We spent $1.2 million in fiscal 2017 on environmental compliance, consisting of $1.0 million for disposal fees and containers, $136,000 for remediation, $40,000 for DEP analysis and fees, and $5,000 for air filtration maintenance.
 In the normal course of our business, we may become involved in various proceedings relating to environmental health and safety matters, and we are currently engaged in an environmental investigation and remediation. Our manufacturing facilities are located on properties with a long history of industrial use, including the use of hazardous substances. We have identified soil and groundwater contamination at our Springfield, Massachusetts plant that we are investigating, monitoring, or remediating, as appropriate. As of April 30, 2017, we had recorded a $730,000 environmental reserve in non-current liabilities. Our estimate of these costs is based upon currently enacted laws and regulations, currently available facts, experience in remediation efforts, existing technology, and the ability of other potentially responsible parties or contractually liable parties to pay the allocated portions of any environmental obligations. 
 When the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used; when the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. We may not have insurance coverage for our environmental remediation costs. We have not recognized any gains from probable recoveries or other gain contingencies. We calculated the environmental reserve using undiscounted amounts based on third-party independent environmental remediation reports. 
 Based on information known to us, we do not expect current environmental regulations or environmental proceedings and claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on us of future environmental compliance requirements or of the cost of resolution of future environmental health and safety proceedings and claims, in part because the scope of the remedies that may be required is not certain, liability under federal environmental laws is joint and several in nature, and environmental laws and regulations are subject to modification and changes in interpretation. There can be no assurance that additional or changing environmental regulation will not become more burdensome in the future and that any such development would not have a material adverse effect on our company. 
 Employees
 As of May 31, 2017, we had 2,204 employees, including 24 part-time employees. Of these employees, 1,686 were engaged in manufacturing, 119 in sales and marketing, 49 in finance and accounting, 64 in research and development, 40 in information services, and 246 in various executive or other administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us. Of our employees, 19.3% have 10 or more years of service with our company and 8.1% have greater than 25 years of service with our company. We believe that our employee relations are good and that the high quality of our employee base is instrumental to our success. 
Backlog 
 As of April 30, 2017 and 2016, we had a Firearm backlog of orders totaling $96.4 million and $304.4 million, respectively. Our Outdoor Products & Accessories had a backlog of orders totaling $12.5 million and $6.6 million as of April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our backlog consists of orders for which purchase orders have been received and which are generally scheduled for shipment within six months and subject to capacity constraints. We allow orders received that have not yet shipped to be cancelled, with cancellations being more likely in periods following surges in demand. Therefore, our backlog may not be indicative of future sales.
