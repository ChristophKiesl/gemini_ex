On May 11, 2017, in anticipation of an initial public offering, ASV Holdings converted from an LLC to a C-Corporation and the Company’s 51% interest was converted to 4,080,000 common shares of ASV.  On May 17, 2017, in connection within its initial public offering, ASV Holdings sold 1,800,000 of its own shares and the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of ASV Holdings common stock and reduced its investment in ASV to a 21.2% interest.  ASV was deconsolidated and was recorded as an equity investment starting with the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Periods ending before June 30, 2017 reflect ASV as a discontinued operation. In February 2018, the Company sold an additional 1,000,000 shares of ASV that it held which reduced the Company’s stake in ASV to approximately 11%.  The Company ceased accounting for its investment in ASV under the equity method and began accounting for its investment as a marketable equity security. In September 2019, in connection with the sale of ASV to Yanmar American Corporation the Company received cash merger consideration for its remaining 1,080,000 shares of ASV and no longer has an investment in ASV.
 Manitex Sabre, Inc. (‘’Sabre”)
 On March 4, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the exploration by management of various strategic alternatives for Sabre, including the possibility of a transaction involving the sale of all or part of Sabre’s business and assets, to determine whether such a transaction would provide value to shareholders. The criterion of asset held for sale had been met and Sabre is reported as a discontinued operation.

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESS 
 Boom Trucks
 A boom truck is a straight telescopic boom crane outfitted with a hook and winch which is mounted on a standard flatbed commercial (Class 7 or 8) truck chassis. Relative to other lifting equipment, boom trucks provide increased versatility with some models capable of transporting relatively large payloads from site to site at highway speeds. A boom truck is usually sold with outriggers, pads and devices for reinforcing the chassis in order to improve safety and stability. Although produced in a wide range of models and sizes, boom trucks can be broadly distinguished by their normal lifting capability as light, medium, and heavy-cranes. Various models of medium or heavy-lift boom trucks can safely lift loads from 15 to 80 tons and operating radii can exceed 200 feet. Another advantage of the boom truck is the ability to provide occasional man lift capabilities at a very low cost to height ratio. While it is not uncommon to see a very old boom truck, most replacement cycles seem to trend to seven years. The market for boom trucks has historically been cyclical. 
 Although the Company offers a complete line of boom trucks from light to heavy capacity cranes much of our efforts have been devoted to the development of higher capacity boom trucks specifically designed to meet the particular needs of customers including those in energy production and electrical power distribution. We believe it is an advantage to be skewed towards the heavier lifting capacity, since the heavier capacity cranes have higher margins. 
 Markets that drive demand for boom trucks include power distribution, oil and gas recovery, infrastructure and new home, commercial and industrial construction.  Historically, the new home construction market, which uses lower capacity cranes, has probably been the most cyclical. Over the past few years, demand from the energy sector has become more cyclical in part due to changes in oil prices. 
 The Company sells its boom trucks through a network of over forty full-service dealers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Middle East. A number of our dealers maintain a rental fleet of their own. Boom trucks can be rented for either short or long-term periods.

In 2020, industry shipments for straight-mast cranes was approximately 750 units and declined approximately 39% compared to 2019.  The data that the Company has seen indicates that dealer rental utilization and United States commercial construction indices experienced some economic disruption associated with COVID-19. During 2020, the Company launched two models of straight-mast cranes and continued development of higher capacity models as we head into 2021.
 Knuckle Boom Cranes
 PM knuckle boom cranes are hydraulic folding and articulating cranes, mounted on a commercial chassis, with lifting capacities that range from small (lifting capacity up to three-ton meter) to super heavy (lifting capacity two-hundred-and-ten-ton meter), often supplied with a jib for additional reach. With a compact design and footprint, the crane can be mounted to maximize the load carrying capability of the chassis onto which it is mounted. Combined with the crane’s ability to operate in a compact footprint the ability to carry a payload provides a competitive advantage over other truck mounted cranes and makes the knuckle boom crane particularly attractive for a variety of end uses in the construction and product delivery sectors.
 The knuckle boom crane market is a global market with a wide variety of end sector applications, but focused particularly on residential and non-residential construction, road and bridge infrastructure development, waste management and utility applications. PM knuckle boom cranes are sold into a variety of geographies including West and East Europe, Central Asia, Africa, North and Central America, South America, the Middle East and the Far East and Pacific region. Historically, PM focused on its domestic and local Western European markets, but in recent years has expanded its sales and distribution efforts internationally. PM has six international sales and distribution offices located in several European countries as well as the Far East and Latin America.  After acquisition by Manitex, the Company expanded its distribution capability with the existing Manitex dealer network in North America as well as expanding the number of independent service centers in the US.
 The market for knuckle boom cranes has been growing in recent years as the acceptability of the product has grown and its advantages have been accepted. Growth in North America, where the straight-mast boom truck crane has been the more dominant product, has been more rapid in recent years in combination with the overall improvement in the North American construction sector. PM’s share of the North American market has been historically low; however, this is an area of growth opportunity for the Company following its acquisition by Manitex.
 In 2019 we started shipping articulated cranes under the brand name PM–Tadano to customers in Asia. This was a key branding initiative we launched during the second half of 2019. Our partnership with Tadano is gaining traction in Asia, and is now expanding into the Middle East, through our PM-Tadano branding efforts and distribution expansion.
 Aerial Work Platforms
 Oil & Steel aerial platforms are self-propelled or truck mounted and places an operator in a basket in the air in order to perform maintenance, repairs or similar activities. The equipment is used in a variety of applications including utilities, sign work and industrial maintenance and is often sold to rental operations.
 Oil & Steel serves a number of geographies in North America, West and East Europe but also the near and Far East and sells through dealers as well as its own sales and distribution offices. In North America, the product sold under the Manitex brand and sold through its distribution network. The market generally follows the domestic economic cycle for any particular country. Consequently, the market has shown a positive trend in the recent past.

Industrial Cranes
 Badger sells specialized industrial cranes through a network of dealers. The Badger product line includes specialized 15 and 30-ton industrial cranes (which can be used by the railroads) as well as a 10 ton carry deck crane which are all sold under both the Badger and Manitex names.  Additionally, Badger sells lattice cranes with 20 to 30 ton lifting capacity marketed under the Little Giant trade name.  The Little Giant line has five lattice boom models, three of which are dedicated rail cranes. In addition, Badger also sells a 30-ton truck crane and a 25-ton crawler crane under the Little Giant name.  Badger also has the capability to manufacture certain of our lower capacity boom trucks and provides expanded boom truck manufacturing capacity when needed.
 The products are used by railroads, refineries, states, municipalities, and for general construction.  The Company believes it has an advantage over its competitors in selling to railroads as it is the only crane manufacturer that has integrated the installation of rail gear into its production process. Competitors send their cranes to a third party to have rail gear added which both increases cost and delays deliveries. 
 Valla product line of industrial cranes is a full range of precision pick and carry cranes from 2 to 44 tons, using electric, diesel, and hybrid power options. Its cranes offer wheeled or tracked, and fixed or swing boom configurations, with special applications designed specifically to meet the needs of its customers. The product is sold internationally through dealers and into the rental distribution channel. 
 Equipment Distribution 
 C&M is a distributor of the Company’s products. C&M Leasing rents equipment manufactured by the Company as well as a limited amount of equipment manufactured by third parties.  
Part Sales
 As part of our operations, we supply repair and replacement parts for our products. The parts business margins are higher than our overall margins. Part sales as a percentage of revenues tend to increase when there is a down-turn in the industry. Part sales as a percentage of revenues are approximately 16% and 13% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Company Revenues by Sources
 The sources of the Company’s revenues are summarized below:
 
 
 | 2020 | | | 2019
-----------------------------------------+------+-----+---+-----
Boom trucks, knuckle boom & truck cranes | | 69 | % | | 72 | %
Part sales | | 16 | % | | 13 | %
Rough terrain cranes | | 6 | % | | 5 | %
Installation services | | 2 | % | | 3 | %
Other equipment | | 7 | % | | 7 | %
Net Revenue | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
In 2020 and 2019, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue. 
 Raw Materials
 The Company purchases a variety of components used in the production of its products.  The Company purchases steel and a variety of machined parts, components and subassemblies including weldments, winches, cylinders, frames, rims, axles, wheels, tires, suspensions, cables, booms and cabs, as well as engines, transmissions and cabs.  Additionally, Manitex and PM mount their cranes on commercial truck chassis, which are either purchased by the Company or supplied by the customer. Lead times for these materials (including chassis) vary from several weeks to many months. The Company is vulnerable to a supply interruption in instances when only one supplier has been qualified and identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers can be very time consuming, and in some cases, could take longer than a year.  The Company has been working on qualifying secondary sources of some products to assure supply consistency and to reduce costs. The degree to which our supply base can respond to changes in market demand directly affects our ability to increase production and the Company attempts to maintain some additional inventory in order to react to unexpected increases in demand. 
 5

Any future supply chain issues that might impact the Company will in part depend on how fast the rate of growth is for a product as well as the rate of growth in the general economy. Strong general economic growth could put us in competition for parts with other industries. Additionally, events or circumstance at a particular supplier could impact the availability of a necessary component.
 Patents and Trademarks
 The Company protects its trade names and trademarks through registration. Its technology consists of bill of materials, drawings, plans, vendor sources and specifications and although the Company’s technology has considerable value, it does not generally have patent protection. The Company has (on rare occasions) filed for patent protection on a specific feature. In the future, the Company will consider seeking patent protection on any new design features believed to present a significant future benefit.
 The Company owns and uses several trademarks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to the Company’s ability to market its products. The Company’s most significant trademark is “Manitex” (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2027).  Badger Equipment Company markets its products under the “Little Giant” and Badger trade names. Valla markets its products under the “Valla” tradename. PM sells its products using the trademark “PM” and PM subsidiary, PM Oil & Steel S.p.A.; formerly known as PM Group S.p.A, sells its products using the “OIL & STEEL” trademark.  The Manitex, Badger, Valla, Little Giant, PM and OIL & STEEL trademarks and trade names are important to the marketing and operation of the Company’s business as a significant number of our products are sold under those names.  PM has three patents. One is registered with the Italian Patents and Trademarks Office until 2028.  PM has two additional patents registered with OHIM that are in force until 2031 and 2034, respectively.
 Seasonality
 Traditionally, the Company’s peak selling periods for cranes are the second and third quarters of a calendar year as a result of the need for equipment in the spring, summer and fall construction seasons.  A significant portion of cranes sold over the last several years have been deployed in specialized industries or applications, such as oil and gas production, power distribution and in the railroad industry. Sales in these markets are subject to significant fluctuations which correlate more with general economic conditions and the prices of commodities, including oil, and generally are not of a seasonal nature. 
 Sales of cranes from the Equipment Distribution division mirror the seasonality of the overall Company. However, the sale of parts is much less seasonal given the geographic breadth of the customer base. Crane repairs are performed by the Equipment Distribution division throughout the year but are somewhat affected by the slowdown in construction activity during the typically harsh winters in the Midwestern United States.
 Competition
 Lifting Equipment
 The market for the Company’s boom trucks and knuckle boom cranes, industrial cranes and trailers is highly competitive. The Company competes based on product design, quality of products and services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. The Company believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.
 The Company’s boom cranes compete with cranes manufactured by National Crane, Custom Truck One Source, Weldco Beales, Elliott and Altec. The Company’s knuckle boom cranes compete with Palfinger, Fassi, Effer and HIAB. The Company competes primarily with Broderson in selling rough terrain and industrial cranes.  
 Equipment Distribution
 The Equipment Distribution division’s primary business is facilitation of sale of products manufactured by the Company. As such, it faces the same competition described above for products manufactured by the Company.  Additionally, the Equipment Distribution division has a dealership arrangement with Terex and must compete against dealers of other crane manufacturers.  Locally, the Equipment Distribution division competes against Runnion Equipment (dealer for National Crane), Power Equipment Leasing (dealer for Elliott) and Guiffre Cranes (dealer for Manitex). 
 While no geographic limitations exist regarding the Equipment Distribution business’s ability to sell cranes internationally, the lack of any barriers to entry and the heavy use of the Internet make this a highly active and competitive market in which to distribute cranes.
 Competition for our Equipment Distribution repair business is even more intense since it is limited geographically due to the necessity of having physical access to the cranes. Most of the above referenced companies also compete in this aspect of the business, as do other types of crane and equipment dealers from nearby areas such as Indiana or Wisconsin.

Equipment Distribution parts sales are global in scope and benefit greatly from the Internet and the tenure and expertise of our employees. While competition in this area is extensive, we believe that the breadth of the products offered and our long history in this part of the business is a competitive advantage.
 Our Equipment Distribution business competes based on the design, quality and performance of the products it distributes, price and the supporting repair and part services that it provides. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. The Company, however, believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.
 Backlog
 The backlog at December 31, 2020 was approximately $68 million, compared to a backlog of approximately $65 million at December 31, 2019.  The December 31, 2020 backlog has increased by $17.5 million since September 30, 2020 when it was at $50.5 million.  The backlog has continued to grow during the early part of 2021 and was $82 million at January 31, 2021.   The Company expects to ship product to fulfill its existing backlog within the next twelve months.
