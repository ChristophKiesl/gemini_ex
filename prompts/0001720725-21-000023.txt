ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. (the Company) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class pharmaceutical therapies to treat ocular surface diseases. The Company's lead product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, a highly selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, is being developed as a nasal spray to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray's novel mechanism of action is designed to re-establish tear film homeostasis by activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway and stimulating the glands and cells responsible for natural tear film production. The Company has identified several additional indications, including some outside of ophthalmology, where this approach could provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients. 
On December 17, 2020, based on the safety and efficacy results from the Phase 2 MYSTIC, Phase 2b ONSET-1, and Phase 3 ONSET-2 clinical trials in over 1,000 subjects with dry eye disease, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The MYSTIC, ONSET-1 and ONSET-2 clinical trials showed statistically significant improvements in Schirmer’s Score (an objective, reproducible, and quantifiable measure of natural tear film production), as compared to control, which was the primary endpoint in all studies. Key secondary endpoints in ONSET-1 and ONSET-2 included change from baseline in symptoms as assessed by eye dryness score. In both of these pivotal studies, there was statistically or nominally statistically significant improvement in symptom scores at Day 28, and in ONSET-2 as early as Day 14, as compared to control. All doses studied in the clinical trial program were well-tolerated with no serious drug related adverse events. 
In addition, on November 30, 2020, the Company submitted to the FDA a protocol to initiate a clinical study in adult patients with neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), a degenerative disease characterized by decreased corneal sensitivity and poor corneal healing. The submission was made to the Company’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in dry eye disease. NK is the second of a number of important potential indications the Company is evaluating for studying OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, illustrating the Company's commitment to treating unmet needs related to ocular surface diseases. Enrollment of the first patient in the OLYMPIA Phase 2 study in NK is planned for the first half of 2021.
Strategy
The Company's goal is to transform the treatment of dry eye disease and other ocular surface diseases by developing a broad portfolio of innovative therapies that target significant unmet medical needs. The Company intends to achieve this goal by pursuing the following key strategic objectives:
•Completing development and obtaining approval of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of dry eye disease. OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant improvements (as compared to placebo) in signs of dry eye disease in the MYSTIC, ONSET-1 and ONSET-2 randomized, controlled clinical trials. In the ONSET-1 and ONSET-2 trials, there was statistically or nominally statistically significant improvement in symptom scores at Day 28, and in ONSET-2 as early as Day 14, as compared to placebo. The Company is not aware of another therapy that has shown statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in multiple registrational clinical trials. However, to date the Company's trials have been designed as randomized, masked, placebo-controlled clinical trials and, as such, the Company has not tested OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray head-to-head with any other products or therapies, nor is it aware of any head-to-head results indicating that such other products or therapies could not have shown similar results. On December 17, 2020, based on the safety and efficacy results from the conducted clinical trials, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
•Establishing specialty sales organization to commercialize OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in the United States. If OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, the Company intends to commercialize its lead product candidate by deploying a specialty sales force at launch of approximately 150-200 field representatives targeting the top-prescribing ophthalmologists and optometrists in the United States. Given the importance of increasing awareness and educating patients with dry eye disease, the Company also anticipates deploying focused direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray. The Company anticipates that this sales organization could also support the commercialization of additional product candidates treating ocular diseases.

•Maximizing value of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and the Company's other product candidates outside the United States. With more than 300 million additional dry eye disease patients outside of the United States, the Company believes there is a significant commercial opportunity for its product candidates internationally. To address these markets, it may seek one or more partners with regional capabilities and infrastructure to support and potentially accelerate the clinical development and commercialization of the Company's product candidates, if approved, in such geographies.
•Developing OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for additional indications associated with and beyond dry eye disease. Based on the fundamental role of natural tear film in ocular surface health, the Company plans to pursue development of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in other indications where this equilibrium is disturbed. First, the Company submitted to the FDA a protocol to initiate a clinical study in adult patients with NK, a degenerative disease resulting from a loss of corneal sensation, which causes progressive damage to the top layer of the cornea. As natural tear film contains a myriad of beneficial components, including endogenous growth factors, proteins and antibodies, the Company believes that its product candidate could be beneficial in improving the health of the cornea in these patients. A second population of potential clinical benefit is in subjects with dry eye disease associated with contact lens intolerance. In addition, based on the unique characteristics of this product candidate, the Company sees the potential for use in patients that are preparing for refractive surgery where there is often an underlying dry eye condition that could impact refraction and ultimately patient satisfaction and quality of life post-surgery.
•Leveraging the capabilities of the Company's experienced discovery and development team and its nAChR domain expertise to continue expanding pipeline of product candidates. The Company has studied a second nAChR agonist product candidate OC-02 (simpinicline) in two Phase 2b clinical trials for dry eye disease. The Company has identified several indications, other than dry eye disease, where it believes this product candidate has the potential to provide a meaningful benefit to patients. In certain indications, the Company believes OC-02 could advance directly into a Phase 2 proof of concept study, supported by preclinical and clinical data that the Company and others have generated. However, the Company cannot guarantee that the FDA will permit it to advance OC-02 into a Phase 2 proof of concept study nor can it guarantee that the FDA will grant marketing approval to OC-02 for the treatment of any indication. Beyond OC-02, the Company plans to continue its efforts to identify and develop additional product candidates.
•Selectively evaluating external opportunities to expand the scope of the Company's pipeline or product offerings. The Company may pursue collaboration, acquisition or in-licensing of product candidates, particularly in its core disease area of ocular surface diseases.
Dry Eye Disease Overview
Dry eye disease is a multifactorial, age-related chronic progressive disease of the ocular surface resulting in pain, visual impairment, tear film hyperosmolarity and instability, and inflammation. Patients with dry eye disease are also more susceptible to eye infections and damage to the surface of the eye (cornea). Dry eye disease is characterized by a reduction in tear volume, rapid breakup of the tear film, or an increase in the evaporative properties of the tear film layer. It can affect daily life, including reading and driving at night and has been associated with depression and migraines. Dry eye disease can also limit patients’ ability to tolerate contact lenses and can impact patient satisfaction with post-op cataract and refractive patients.
As illustrated below, the Lacrimal Functional Unit (LFU), which is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, is comprised of Meibomian glands, lacrimal glands, and goblet cells that are responsible for producing the three layers that comprise healthy tear film. The National Eye Institute defines healthy tear film as “a complex mixture of fatty oils, water, mucus, and more than 1,500 different proteins that keep the surface of the eye smooth and protected from the environment, irritants, and infectious pathogens.” The outermost layer of tear film is a lipid layer produced by the Meibomian glands that keeps tear film from evaporating too quickly. The lacrimal glands produce the aqueous layer, which comprises the bulk of tear volume and flow. This middle layer is not just water – it contains thousands of proteins, enzymes, antibodies and growth factors that are cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial. The aqueous layer nourishes the cornea and the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane that covers the entire front of the eye and the inside of the eyelids. Finally, the innermost mucin layer is produced by goblet cells and binds water from the aqueous layer to ensure that the eye remains wet. The LFU receives stimulus from the trigeminal nerve, which has sensory nerve endings in the nasal cavity.

LFU dysfunction leads to the loss of tear film homeostasis and can ultimately lead to the cycle of chronic dry eye disease. Animal models of dry eye disease have consistently shown that disrupting the parasympathetic input to the lacrimal gland causes decrease in tear film production resulting in a corresponding increase in corneal fluorescein staining and inflammatory markers. Re-establishment of tear film production normalizes staining and inflammatory markers. Chronic disruption and instability of the tear film results in irritation, inflammation, and ultimately cellular damage. Chronic symptoms of dry eye disease include a scratchy sensation (foreign body sensation), stinging or burning, episodes of excess tearing that follow periods of dryness, discharge, pain, and redness in the eye. In addition, patients with dry eye often experience blurred vision as the cornea and the tear film are responsible for 65%-75% of the eye’s focusing power. Approved prescription treatments for dry eye disease, as well as therapies in clinical development, target inflammation further down the dry eye disease continuum. The Company believes these therapies have only been studied in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease and do not address the loss of tear film homeostasis, the fundamental characteristic of dry eye disease. The Company's lead product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is designed to stimulate the LFU to produce natural tear film, re-establish tear film homeostasis and improve the signs and symptoms of patients with dry eye disease.
Market opportunity in dry eye disease
Dry eye disease is highly prevalent and growing, affecting more than 340 million people globally based on the studies conducted in 2016. In the United States, dry eye disease affects an estimated 14.5% of the adult population, or 34 million adults, resulting in greater than $55 billion in annual indirect costs, such as reductions in productivity. Prevalence of dry eye disease continues to grow due to an aging population, increase in autoimmune diseases, contact lens wear and digital screen time. Although dry eye disease is one of the most common reasons people visit eye care practitioners (ECPs) in the United States, it is estimated that only 16 million adults have been diagnosed with dry eye disease by an ECP, which the Company believes is due in part to lack of education and insufficient awareness on the part of the patient.
Despite the number of patients diagnosed with dry eye disease, the Company estimates that only 7 million patients have started a prescription treatment regimen which the Company believes is based at least in part on a lack of treatment options that are suitable for chronic use. In a survey the Company commissioned in June 2017 (the ECP Survey) ECPs were generally neutral or dissatisfied with their treatment options for patients with dry eye disease. The ECP Survey was conducted by means of a distributed questionnaire to 150 respondent ECPs who specialize primarily in ophthalmology or optometry, are board-certified or 

board-eligible, manage at least 40 unique patients per month with dry eye disease and are familiar with, or prescribe, currently available prescription therapies. In the ECP Survey, the Company asked ECPs to select whether they completely disagreed, were neutral or completely agreed with the statement that they “can successfully treat all dry eye disease patients with currently available options.” Approximately 40% of ECPs responded that they completely disagreed with the statement, approximately 50% responded that they were neutral and only 10% responded that they completely agreed. Similarly, the top clinical reasons patients discontinued therapy were insufficient symptom improvement, side effects, and delayed onset of action. Medication cost was also a factor in discontinuing therapy. However, in another survey, conducted among the patients who had discontinued Restasis® due to costs, 72% stated they would have been willing to pay the same price if the medication had worked better. The Company believes the results in the survey reflect why only 2 million patients are on a prescription therapy at any given time. Despite the small percentage of dry eye disease patients on prescription therapy, Restasis (marketed by Allergan) had U.S. sales in 2019 of $1.2 billion. 
Current treatment options and their limitations
Dry eye disease is primarily treated with a variety of over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and four FDA-approved prescription eye drop therapies: Restasis®, Xiidra® (marketed by Novartis), Cequa™ (marketed by Sun Pharma) and Eysuvis™ (marketed by Kala Pharmaceuticals). Artificial tears are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability but are primarily saline-based and provide only temporary relief. Restasis® and Cequa™, both calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants, and Xiidra®, a lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist which has been approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, address chronic inflammation associated with dry eye disease. Eysuvis™, a corticosteroid which has been approved for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, addresses acute inflammation. Other products used by patients suffering from dry eye disease include ointments, gels, warm compresses, omega-3 fatty acid supplements and a number of medical devices. Unfortunately, all currently approved treatment options for dry eye disease have significant limitations, which include:
•Mechanisms of action only address inflammation. Currently approved therapies only target inflammation for moderate to severe dry eye disease; no approved pharmaceutical products replicate natural tear film, which is highly complex in composition. As these prescription therapies fail to address the fundamental characteristic of dry eye disease, the loss of tear film homeostasis, the Company estimates that 75% of patients still require over-the-counter therapies to supplement their treatment.
•Slow onset of action. Based on data reported from clinical trials, currently available treatments can take between three to six months to demonstrate a significant effect in clinical signs. The Company believes this delayed onset of action may hinder compliance and in turn may limit the benefit that patients derive from such treatments.
•Tolerability and compliance issues. Currently approved pharmaceutical therapies for dry eye disease are typically administered in an eye-drop formulation and are commonly associated with ocular burning, reduced visual acuity and bad taste after application. The effective use of eye drops can be challenging for some patients and may result in reduced compliance. Corticosteroids are limited based on known complications of glaucoma and damage to the optic nerve as well as delayed wound healing of the cornea.
To address these limitations and the high unmet need expressed by patients, ECPs and payors, the Company has been developing OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, which it believes, if approved, has the potential to become the new standard of care for dry eye disease. However, there is no guarantee that it will provide results comparable to existing treatments. OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray’s highly differentiated mechanism of action, as shown in preclinical and clinical studies, is designed to re-establish tear film homeostasis, addressing the fundamental disease process, regardless of stage of disease or underlying cause. The Company is not aware of any other drug companies focused on activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway (TPP) and stimulating the LFU to increase tear production. OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray has demonstrated rapid onset of action to significantly improve signs and symptoms in the same patient population within a single registrational clinical trial. Furthermore, the novel delivery of OC-01 (varenicline) in a nasal spray spares the ocular surface and contributes to a favorable tolerability profile. To date, there have been no reports of burning or stinging to the ocular surface or negative effects on taste or smell in clinical trials of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray. The Company believes OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, if approved, has the potential to offer improved clinical outcomes and patient compliance based on its registrational trial results, favorable tolerability profile and rapid onset of action, therefore making it particularly suitable for use broadly across mild, moderate and severe patient populations.

Company's approach: activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway to promote natural tear film production
The Company's novel treatment approach for dry eye disease is designed to leverage the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate natural tear film production and re-establish tear film homeostasis. A healthy tear film protects and lubricates the eyes, washes away foreign particles, contains antimicrobials to reduce the risk of infection, and creates a smooth surface that contributes refractive power for clear vision.
The Trigeminal Parasympathetic Pathway (TPP)
The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is a division of the autonomic nervous system and is responsible for actions such as stimulating gland function, constriction of the pupil, slowing down heart rate and contractility, contracting bronchial musculature and stimulating bronchial secretions, and increasing gut motility for digestion. The parasympathetic nervous system controls tear film homeostasis and the activity of the LFU partially via the trigeminal nerve. The PNS uses acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter.
Anesthetizing the nasal mucosa has been shown to result in a 34% reduction in tear film production. This has also been observed in patients with reduced nasal air flow resulting from severe nasal allergy and patients with tracheostomy, suggesting that stimulation of the trigeminal nerve is important for tear production. Since then, additional studies have demonstrated a persistent decrease in aqueous tear production in patients with trigeminal nerve damage (such as trauma, trigeminal nerve ablation and herpetic infection) or pathology.
The Company refers to the communication between the trigeminal nerve and the LFU as the TPP. The efferent paths (away from the nose) of the TPP proceed from the superior salivary nucleus along the facial nerve to the geniculate ganglion and from there through the greater superficial petrosal nerve via the sphenopalatine ganglion to the LFU. Activating the TPP results in the stimulation of the Meibomian glands, lacrimal glands (main and accessory), and goblet cells comprising the LFU and promotes natural tear film production.
Targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) on the trigeminal nerve
The Company's approach to dry eye disease relies on a pharmaceutical stimulation of a class of receptors called nAChR that are located on the trigeminal nerve and readily accessible within the anterior nasal cavity. nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels that when bound by an agonist have the potential for ganglionic neurotransmission. The nAChRs subtypes found on human neurons are comprised of various homomeric (all one subunit) or heteromeric (at least one α and one ß subunit) combinations of 12 different nicotinic receptor subunits: α2-α10 and ß2-ß4. Stimulation of these receptors results in a rapid increase in cellular permeability to Na + and Ca 2+ resulting in depolarization of the cell membrane and initiation of an action potential. However, not all subtypes of nAChRs have the ability to activate the TPP (for example, treatment with a homomeric α7 agonist has no effect on this pathway). Additionally, the functional response of an nAChR to agonists is comprised of two dose-dependent, opposing effects: receptor activation after short exposure to high agonist concentrations (µM range), and desensitization upon prolonged exposure to low agonist concentrations (nM range).
The Company's product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray contains an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that is highly selective to the nAChRs that activate the TPP. The Company believes this is the first application of nAChR agonists to be delivered nasally to stimulate the nerves of the PNS. Additionally, it has found that OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray's unique receptor binding characteristics and the localized nasal delivery allows for short-term agonist exposure with a high local concentration, and, once absorbed across the nasal mucosa, results in low systemic exposure and therefore avoids desensitization.

Product Candidates 
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for dry eye disease
The Company's lead product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is being developed as a nasal spray to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The API of OC-01, varenicline, is a highly selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist with full agonist activity at the α7 receptor and partial agonist activity at the α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, and α4α6ß2 receptors. Varenicline tartrate, marketed as Chantix®, was developed and commercialized by Pfizer as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. The compound was studied in multiple dose-ranging, placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies as well as two confirmatory Phase 3 studies to study the safety and efficacy in otherwise healthy smokers in the United States. In 2006, varenicline was approved by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency and subsequently has been approved in more than 80 other countries throughout the world. To date, varenicline oral tablets have been prescribed to more than 20 million patients worldwide, including more than 11 million adults in the United States.
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is a preservative-free, aqueous nasal spray designed to be delivered twice daily to each nostril in a 50 µl spray for the treatment of dry eye disease. The highest intranasal concentration of varenicline being studied in ONSET-1 and ONSET-2 was 1.2 mg/ml, approximately 7.5% of the systemic exposure of a single maintenance dose of Chantix® (1 mg) on a normalized dosing basis. 
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray’s novel mechanism of action
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray’s novel mechanism of action, as shown in preclinical and clinical studies, is designed to re-establish tear film homeostasis by stimulating the trigeminal nerve, activating the TPP and stimulating the glands and cells responsible for natural tear film production. The Company believes that the development of OC-01 (varenicline) as a nasal spray represents the first pharmacological treatment approach for dry eye disease targeting the nerves that control the LFU. OC-01 (varenicline), when sprayed into the anterior portion of the nasal cavity, stimulates nAChRs located on the chemosensory endings of the trigeminal nerve resulting in cholinergic neurotransmission.
Once OC-01 (varenicline) is bound to an nAChR, it stabilizes the open state of the ion channel allowing influx of cations such as Ca2+ and Na + ions, thus creating an action potential. This action potential ultimately activates the glands and cells of the LFU to produce natural tear film. Once OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is delivered, it takes approximately 10-15 seconds before tear film is produced. The receptors can be in the activated state for many minutes to hours after stimulation (a process termed smoldering activation).
The Company believes that increasing tear film volume and re-establishing tear film homeostasis will address the fundamental characteristic in the development and treatment of dry eye disease, regardless of etiology, and has the potential to treat a broad population of patients throughout the dry eye continuum.
Development program for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray
In October 2018, the Company reported results from ONSET-1, a multicenter, dose-ranging, randomized, double-masked, placebo (vehicle)-controlled, registrational Phase 2b clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in 182 subjects with dry eye disease in the United States. 
The Company also completed a comparative pharmacokinetic “bridge” trial (ZEN) to evaluate the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a nasal spray (OC-01) compared to varenicline administered orally (Chantix®) and reported top line results in November 2019. The exposure levels following nasal spray administration of varenicline are significantly lower than those seen with oral varenicline. If the FDA determines that the results of this trial establish an adequate bridge between OC-01 

(varenicline) nasal spray and Chantix®, it will allow the Company to reference certain FDA conclusions regarding the safety of varenicline from the Agency’s review of the Chantix® NDA. Otherwise, additional data may be needed to support the NDA and potential approval of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray.
In January 2020, the Company reported results from MYSTIC, a randomized, single-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in 123 subjects with dry eye disease. The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray administered for 84 days. Although the study adds to the totality of the data in support of the efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in subjects with dry eye disease, the MYSTIC data is only being used to support the safety of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in terms of the NDA submission.
Following ONSET-1, the Company initiated a Phase 3 registrational clinical trial (ONSET-2) in July 2019 and released positive top line the results of the study in May 2020. During the ONSET-2 Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 758 subjects, OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (as compared to placebo) in signs of dry eye disease in both the 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml dose groups and statistically significant improvements (as compared to placebo) in both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in the 1.2 mg/ml dose group. 
Clinical Trials Results
In the description of the Company's clinical trials below, n represents the number of patients in a particular group and p or p-values represent the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value=0.001 means that there is a 0.1% probability that the difference between the placebo group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). A p-value ≤ 0.05 is a commonly used criterion for statistical significance, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities. The confidence interval (CI) means a range of values for a variable of the measure of treatment effect, constructed so that this range has a specified probability of including the true value of the variable.
ONSET-1: Phase 2b clinical trial results
In ONSET-1, OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The study compared three different doses of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray to placebo. The pre-specified primary (sign) endpoint was the assessment of tear production as measured by Schirmer’s Score (compared to the baseline Schirmer’s Score) at Week 4 and the two pre-specified secondary (symptom) endpoints were patient-reported symptoms of dry eye disease as measured by EDS at Weeks 3 and 4. The Company also evaluated corneal fluorescein staining, a marker of corneal epithelial cell health, at Week 4, as an exploratory endpoint in ONSET-1. Due to the relatively small sample size of the study and the use of the Controlled Adverse Environment, which is a registered trademark of Ora, Inc., (or CAE®) that can exacerbate staining, ONSET-1 was not designed or powered to assess statistical significance for this endpoint. Baseline disease characteristics were generally similar across all treatment groups, with the exception of the 1.2 mg/ml OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray dose group where lower average disease severity was observed as indicated by a higher mean Schirmer’s test (5.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 4.5 to 5.2 mm) and a lower mean EDS (53.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 63.7 to 65.6 mm).
Although the Company cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant marketing approval for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray based on the use of these endpoints, ONSET-1’s pre-specified endpoints are consistent with those that have been previously utilized in clinical trials of FDA-approved products for dry eye disease. The Schirmer’s Score, which was the same primary sign endpoint used in the FDA’s approval of Restasis®, is determined by placing a test strip in the lower eyelid pouch and measuring the length of the test paper strip that is moistened after five minutes. Sometimes a topical anesthetic is placed into the eye before the filter paper to prevent tearing due to the irritation from the paper. The study eye was pre-defined as the eye that met eligibility criteria in the study and in the event that both eyes met criteria, was the eye with more tearing at baseline upon stimulation or in the event that both eyes were again equal, the eye with the worse baseline Schirmer’s Score. The fellow eye is the eye that was not defined as the study eye and may or may not have met all study eligibility criteria. The EDS, which was the primary symptom endpoint used in the FDA’s approval of Xiidra®, is based on the patient’s rating of eye dryness on a visual analog scale (where 0=no discomfort and 100=maximal discomfort) with respect to both eyes. The study was designed and pre-specified to statistically analyze the 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray dose groups. The study was not designed to formally analyze the 0.12 mg/ml dose group to avoid spending statistical power on a dose that was not hypothesized to provide clinically meaningful results. Therefore, no p-value is formally reported for the 0.12 mg/ml dose group.
In ONSET-1, the 182 subjects were randomly sorted into the four treatment groups following assessment of each subject’s baseline Schirmer’s Score and EDS. The mean baseline disease characteristics across all treatment groups were generally similar with the exception of the 1.2 mg/ml OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray dose group. In this group, subjects showed 

lower baseline disease severity, with a higher mean Schirmer’s Score (5.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 4.5 to 5.2 mm) and a lower mean EDS (53.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 63.7 to 65.6 mm).
ONSET-1 had two pre-specified secondary endpoints. The first secondary endpoint was the mean change from baseline to Week 4 in EDS (both eyes). A statistically significant reduction in mean EDS from baseline to Week 4 was observed in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group, with a LS mean change from baseline EDS of -19.0 mm (95% CI -26.2 to -11.7; p=0.021). The LS mean change from baseline EDS to Week 4 for the 1.2 mg/ml dose group was -15.4 mm (95% CI -23.3 to -7.5; p=0.13). The other secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 3 in mean EDS at five minutes post treatment in the CAE®. As the first secondary outcome was statistically different from placebo only in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group, change in EDS was formally tested in that dose group alone. At Week 3, in the CAE®, the LS mean difference in change from baseline of the EDS between the 0.6 mg/ml dose and placebo groups at five minutes post treatment in CAE® was -11.6 mm (95% CI -20.1 to -3.0; p=0.006). The LS mean difference between the 1.2 mg/ml dose and placebo groups in the change from baseline EDS was -14.0 mm (95% CI -22.9 to -5.1). While no formal analysis was performed on the 1.2 mg/ml dose group, as this dose group was not statistically significant in the first secondary endpoint, the nominal p-value was p<0.001.
Sensitivity analyses at ten and fifteen minutes post treatment in the CAE® showed similar reductions in EDS as those seen at five minutes post treatment in subjects treated with OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray compared to subjects treated with placebo.
ONSET-1 was not designed or powered to assess corneal fluorescein staining, although the Company did ultimately measure this as an exploratory analysis using the National Eye Institute Corneal Fluorescein grading scale. This scale measures corneal staining in five distinct regions on the cornea: central, superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal, as well as a total score that includes all regions. At Week 4, in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group, total corneal staining (95% CI -2.9 to -0.2; p=0.020), nasal corneal staining (95% CI -0.8 to -0.0; p=0.026), and inferior corneal staining (95% CI -0.8 to -0.1; p=0.006) showed a statistically significant benefit as compared to placebo. There was a directional benefit in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group favoring OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in central, superior, and temporal staining as compared to placebo. The Company believes that this is the only registrational study to show a statistically significant benefit in corneal fluorescein staining as soon as Week 4. There was no statistically significant benefit in corneal fluorescein staining in 1.2 mg/ml dose group, although there was a directional benefit favoring OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in total, central, temporal, inferior, and nasal staining as compared to placebo.
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray was well tolerated at all doses assessed in the study with only one serious adverse event reported (in the 0.6 mg/ml dose), which was not suspected to be related to the study drug. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events in ONSET-1 were non-ocular, whereas reports of ocular adverse events were few and transient. Only one subject each in the 0.12 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml dose groups and two subjects in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group reported ocular adverse events compared to seven subjects in the placebo group. Of these reported events, reduced visual acuity was reported by one subject each in the 0.12 mg/ml and 0.6 mg/ml dose groups compared to three subjects in the placebo group, and each instance of reduced visual acuity reported was resolved by the next visit. No other ocular adverse event was reported by more than one subject.
Four subjects discontinued the study due to adverse events. One subject in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group withdrew from the study after one day of treatment due to dizziness. Three subjects in the 1.2 mg/ml dose group withdrew from the study. The first subject withdrew from the 1.2 mg/ml dose group after one day of treatment due to sneezing and throat irritation. The other two subjects withdrew from the 1.2 mg/ml dose group after two days of treatment due to (i) nasopharyngitis and (ii) tinnitus, headache and eyelid edema, respectively. No subjects withdrew from the study after the second day of treatment. The most commonly reported non-adverse events in ONSET-1 were sneezing and coughing. No subjects in the placebo group reported either sneezing or cough.
ZEN: Phase 1 comparative pharmacokinetic clinical trial results
The Company completed a comparative pharmacokinetic “bridge” trial (ZEN) where it evaluated the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a nasal spray (OC-01) compared to varenicline administered orally. The Company reported positive top-line results in November 2019. ZEN is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of OC-01 (varenicline) administered as a nasal spray compared to varenicline administered orally. 
Top-line results indicated that administration of 2 sprays (one in each nostril) of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is detected in plasma by 5 minutes, and generally achieves peak concentration within 2 hours, with a mean Cmax of 0.34 ng/mL. OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray administered intranasally as a 60 mcg per 50-µL spray into each nostril resulted in a varenicline mean Cmax of 0.34 ng/mL and AUC0-inf was 7.46 h*ng/mL. The results from the bioavailability study demonstrate that total systemic exposure of 0.12 mg administered intranasally was 7.5% compared to a 1 mg oral dose of varenicline. 

The study demonstrated that OC-01(varenicline) nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated at the doses tested. The number of subjects reporting any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 13 out of 21 (61.9%) after nasal spray administration and 9 out of 22 (40.9%) after oral tablet administration but there were no reports of serious TEAE noted with either oral or nasal administration. The most common adverse events in the nasal spray group were sneeze in 7 volunteers (33.3%) and cough in 6 volunteers (28.6%). All events were mild. There were no events of sneeze or cough in the oral tablet administration group. The most common adverse events in the oral tablet administration group were nausea in 5 volunteers (22.7%) and vomiting in 4 volunteers (18.2%). All events were mild or moderate in severity. There were no events of nausea or vomiting in the nasal spray administration group. 
This trial could allow the Company to reference certain FDA conclusions regarding the safety of varenicline tartrate from the Agency’s review of the Chantix® NDA. The FDA has indicated that reliance upon the varenicline tartrate data in the Company's 505(b)(2) NDA submission would be considered scientifically justified if exposure levels following nasal spray administration of its final clinical formulation are less than or equal to that of Chantix® at its approved dose and route of administration. 
MYSTIC: Phase 2 clinical trial results 
The MYSTIC study was a randomized, single-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in 123 subjects with dry eye disease at the Asociación para Evitar la Ceguera (APEC) in Mexico City. APEC is the largest specialized ophthalmology hospital in North America by patient volume. The study compared two different doses of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray (0.6 mg/ml or 1.2 mg/ml) to vehicle control nasal spray (1:1:1 randomization). The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray administered for 84 days. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the assessment of tear production as measured by mean change in Schirmer’s score at Day 84 as compared to vehicle control. 
A statistically significant improvement in Schirmer’s Score at Day 84 was observed in both doses as compared to placebo. The 0.6 mg/ml dose was associated with a least squares (LS) mean change from baseline Schirmer’s Score of 10.6 mm (95% CI 7.9-13.4; p<0.05), while the 1.2 mg/ml dose was associated with a least squares (LS) mean change from baseline Schirmer’s Score of 11.0 mm (95% CI 7.9-14.0; p<0.05). Results were statistically significant in both the observed and Last Observation Carried Forward analyses. 
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray was well tolerated at all doses assessed in the study with no serious adverse events reported suspected to be related to the study drug. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events in MYSTIC were non-ocular, whereas reports of ocular adverse events were few and transient. The number of subjects reporting non-ocular treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in any dose group was 6 out of 41 (14.6%) in each OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray dose groups and 9 out of 41 (22.0%) in the vehicle control group. There were no reports of serious TEAE in the study and no serious adverse events related to study drug administration. The most common overall adverse events in the nasal spray groups were blurry vision, sneezing, and headache. All events were mild in the OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray groups and resolved by the next visit.
ONSET-2: Phase 3 clinical trial results
ONSET-2 is a multicenter, dose-ranging, randomized, double-masked, placebo (vehicle)-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) in approximately 750 subjects with dry eye disease in the United States. 
The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray at the two different dose levels, administered for 4 weeks. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects gaining at least 10mm on the Schirmer’s Score as compared to control. Pre-specified secondary endpoints included mean change in Schirmer’s Score (sign) at Week 4, patient-reported symptoms of DED as measured by EDS in the normal clinic environment at Weeks 1, 2 and 4, as well as in a CAE®, a low humidity, high airflow environment at Week 4. The study also measured corneal fluorescein staining in both dose groups at Week 4. Subjects will continue to be evaluated post-treatment in a long-term follow up through 12 months.
A statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of percentage of subjects gaining at least 10 mm in Schirmer’s Score at Week 4 was observed in both doses tested as compared to control as shown in the figure below. In the group of subjects treated with the 0.6 mg/ml dose, the percentage of subjects gaining at least 10mm on Schirmer’s Score was 44% (p<0.0001 vs. control). In the 1.2 mg/ml dose group, the percentage of subjects gaining at least 10mm on Schirmer’s Score was 47% (p<0.0001 vs. control). The percentage of subjects gaining at least 10mm on Schirmer’s Score in the control group was 26%.

Additionally, consistent with the 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml results observed in ONSET-1, there was a statistically significant improvement in mean change in Schirmer’s Score at Week 4 in both doses tested as compared to control as shown in the figure below. In the group of subjects treated with the 0.6 mg/ml dose, at Week 4 the mean change from baseline in Schirmer’s Score was 11.0 mm (p<0.0001 vs. control). In the group of subjects treated with the 1.2 mg/ml dose, at Week 4 the mean change from baseline on Schirmer’s Score was 11.2 mm (p<0.0001 vs. control). Mean change from baseline on Schirmer’s Score in the control group was 5.9 mm.
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray was well-tolerated in ONSET-2 and the adverse event data collected to date was consistent with the results of ONSET-1. The most common adverse event experienced in the treatment groups was sneeze after administration, which occurred with 50% of nasal spray administrations. These adverse events were predominantly transient, with the majority of sneezes occurring within the first minute following administration, and mild in severity. There were no reports of serious adverse events determined to be related to nasal administration. The number of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events related to study drug leading to treatment discontinuation was 2% or less in either treatment group.
After conducting further post-hoc analyses of the data, the Company believes that there is a treatment benefit in the 1.2 mg/ml dose group that was not captured with the statistical method used for analysis of the endpoint. The statistical power for assessing this endpoint was negatively impacted by a decrease in the sample size, which the Company believes was due in part to subjects being unable to be assessed as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In addition, there were a number of subjects that did not meet the criteria for treatment in the CAE®, thereby further reducing statistical power. Treatments in the CAE® are only administered if a participant reports an Ocular Discomfort score ≥ 3 at two or more consecutive time points in at least one eye during CAE® exposure, for participants with an Ocular Discomfort rating of 3 at baseline. Participants with an Ocular Discomfort rating of 4 at baseline for an eye must report an Ocular Discomfort rating of 4 for two additional consecutive measurements for that eye, not including the baseline measurement.
OLYMPIA: Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK) clinical trial study
Leveraging its nAChR domain expertise, the Company continues to explore the development of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for a number of potential indications and uses associated with and beyond dry eye disease including NK, dry eye associated with contact lens intolerance, and ocular surface treatment for refractive surgeries.
NK is caused when the nerves that supply the cornea cannot function properly. NK reduces sensitivity of the cornea. When the cornea senses stimulation or pressure, the eyelids will close and tears will be produced to protect the cornea and the eye. Because these nerves do not function properly in NK, the outer layer of the cornea, called the epithelium, can break down, resulting in an epithelial defect. In more advanced NK, an interior layer called the cornea stroma can break down as well, resulting in thinning of the cornea. This is called stromal “melting.” In advanced stromal melting, the cornea can thin to a severe degree, which can result in a hole or opening to the inside of the eye, which can lead to infection and potentially loss of the eye. NK can lead to a variety of complications, including poor wound healing of the cornea, scarring of the cornea, and loss of vision. There are many different conditions that can damage the nerves serving the cornea.
A variety of therapies can be used to treat this disorder depending on how far the disorder has progressed in an individual. Most recently, Oxervate, a recombinant human nerve growth factor, has been approved for the treatment of NK. Unfortunately there are several limitations to this therapy, including that the product must be refrigerated, administered six times per day at two-hour intervals for eight weeks, and delivered with a pipette that can be cumbersome for self-administration. Additionally, the cost of the product is more than $90,000 for an eight-week course of therapy.
Normal tear film contains a number of biologically active growth factors including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor. The Company believes that stimulating natural tear film production twice daily for eight weeks may provide appropriate nourishment and lubrication that will be beneficial in treating NK. 

The NK study design, OLYMPIA, is included below:
OLYMPIA Study Design
Regulatory
The Company met with the FDA in February 2019 for an end of Phase 2 meeting following the completion of ONSET-1, and the FDA indicated that ONSET-1 could serve as one of the two pivotal safety and efficacy studies required to support a 505(b)(2) NDA filing for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray. Based on this feedback, the Company initiated ONSET-2, a 750-subject, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, in July 2019. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray at 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml doses as compared to placebo for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Assuming the effect size seen in ONSET-1, and based on this sample size, the power for each dose for both sign and symptom endpoints would be 99% or greater. This study, in addition to ONSET-1, allowed the Company to achieve the minimum number of subjects for safety-monitoring purposes. This study had similar eligibility criteria and design to ONSET-1.
On November 30, 2020, the Company submitted to the FDA a protocol to initiate a clinical study in adult patients with NK, a degenerative disease characterized by decreased corneal sensitivity and poor corneal healing. The submission was made to the Company's IND for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in dry eye disease. NK is the second of a number of important potential indications the Company is evaluating for studying OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, illustrating the Company's commitment to treating unmet needs related to ocular diseases. Enrollment of the first patient in the OLYMPIA Phase 2 study in NK is planned for the first half of 2021.
Varenicline tartrate is currently marketed by Pfizer in the United States under the trade name Chantix® as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. The Company has submitted a 505(b)(2) NDA for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, relying in part upon certain FDA conclusions regarding the safety of varenicline from the Agency’s review of the Chantix® NDA.
On December 17, 2020, based on the safety and efficacy results from the Phase 1 Zen, Phase 2 MYSTIC, Phase 2b ONSET-1 and Phase 3 ONSET-2 clinical trials in over 1,000 subjects with dry eye disease, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for the treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. The Company faces potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that the Company successfully develops and commercializes will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The Company believes that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of its product candidates will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
A number of therapies are currently available for the treatment of dry eye disease in the United States. The most commonly used treatments for dry eye disease in the United States are over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and four FDA-approved prescription eye drop therapies: Restasis®, Xiidra®, Cequa™ and Eysuvis™. Artificial tears are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability but are primarily saline-based and provide only temporary relief. Restasis® and Cequa™, both calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants, and Xiidra, a LFA-1 antagonist, address chronic inflammation associated with dry eye disease. Eysuvis™ provides temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, which may include the management of dry eye disease flares. Other treatment options include ointments, gels, warm compresses, omega-3 fatty acid supplements and a number of medical devices. The Company is aware of many other companies developing therapies for dry eye disease, including Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Alcon, Aldeyra Therapeutics, Allergan, Azura Ophthalmics, Bausch Health (Novaliq), HanAll BioPharma, Johnson & Johnson, Mitotech, Novartis, Parion Sciences, ReGenTree, Silk Technologies, Sylentis, TopiVert Pharma, and TearSolutions.
Many of the companies against which the Company may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with the Company in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the Company's programs.
Sales and Marketing
In light of the Company's stage of development, it has not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. If OC-01(varenicline) nasal spray receives regulatory approval, the Company plans to commercialize it in the United States with a focused, specialty sales force that could consist of its own employees, outsourced sales professionals, or a hybrid model utilizing both internal and external resources. In anticipation of the FDA PDUFA date, the Company projects hiring approximately 150 to 200 sales representatives that will call on top-prescribing ophthalmologists and optometrists. The Company believes an organization of this size would allow it to reach ECPs that collectively care for more than 80% of patients diagnosed with DED in the United States. Given the importance of increasing awareness and educating patients with dry eye disease, the Company also anticipates deploying focused direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray. The Company's sales force could also support the commercialization of additional product candidates treating ocular diseases. The Company also expects to explore commercialization of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and potentially other product candidates in certain markets outside the United States, including the European Union, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.
Manufacturing
The Company does not currently own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storing, distributing or testing of its product candidates. It relies, and expects to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), to manufacture and supply its preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of its product candidates.
The product candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is a presentation of varenicline, the API, formulated into a nasal spray formulation comprised of phosphate buffer to provide appropriate pH control and sodium chloride to obtain suitable osmolality for a nasal spray. The Company believes the amounts of the API as well as OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray it currently has on hand are sufficient to complete future clinical studies. Additional cGMP varenicline API, nasal pumps and bottle components and manufacturing capacity campaigns are available in adequate quantities to ensure full supply for the Company's commercial scale-up, validation and commercial launch activities if OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray is approved.

Although, the Company currently relies on separate, single CMO as its sole supplier for the OC-01 API and a single CMO to manufacture OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, it is also in the process of identifying and qualifying additional manufacturers to provide OC-01 API and drug product manufacturing to support the submission of a post approval change to the NDA, if approved, for OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for commercial supply or to support future clinical studies. The Company expects that it can qualify an OC-01 API manufacturer and qualify and transfer the process to a selected CMO. Additionally, the drug product manufacturing is a simple compounding and micro controlled filling operation that could also be transferred to additional CMOs as necessary.
The Company's third party service providers, third party supply chain providers, their facilities and the OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray used in clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). The cGMP regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Product candidates used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements and satisfy FDA or other authorities’ requirements before any product is approved and before the Company can manufacture commercial products. The Company's third party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of their facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray to assess compliance with applicable regulations. The Company's failure, or the failure to its third party providers and supply chain providers, to comply with such statutory and regulatory requirements could subject the Company to possible legal or regulatory action, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, suspension of production, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these actions could have a material impact on clinical or future commercial supplies of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or the Company's other product candidates. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Intellectual Property
Patents
The Company's success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for its product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing its proprietary rights. The Company's patent portfolio is intended to cover its product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, the Company's proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to its business. It also relies on trade secret protection of confidential information and know-how relating to the Company's proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates.
The Company's patent portfolio as of December 31, 2020 contained approximately 16 issued and unexpired United States (U.S.) patents, three pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications, and two pending patent cooperation treaty (PCT) applications that are solely owned by the Company and certain foreign counterparts of a subset of these patents and patent applications in foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and countries within the European Patent Convention and the Eurasian Patent Organization. Owing to the substantial cost of prosecuting patent application internationally, the Company has selectively and strategically abandoned certain of its patent applications in countries with smaller markets and/or a history of weak patent enforcement record. With respect to its candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, the Company's patents and patent applications include methods of treatment and pharmaceutical formulations. With respect to the Company's candidate OC-02, the patents and patent applications cover chemical composition, synthesis and preparation, formulations, and methods of treatment. The Company continues to seek to maximize the scope of its patent protection for all its programs. The Company has five issued U.S. patents relating to methods of treating dry eye disease, increasing tear production, and improving ocular discomfort using varenicline, as well as pharmaceutical formulations for local nasal administration of varenicline. The patents are U.S. Pat. Nos.: 9,504,644, 9,504,645, 9,532,944, 9,597,284 and 10,456,396. These patents expire in 2035.
Licenses
The Company is party to a non-exclusive patent license agreement (the License Agreement) with Pfizer. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Pfizer granted the Company non-exclusive rights under Pfizer’s patent rights covering varenicline tartrate and related salts thereof, including U.S. Patent Nos.: 7,265,119 and 6,890,927 to develop, manufacture, and commercialize OC-01 varenicline product candidate for the treatment of any ophthalmic disease or condition via nasal administration in the United States. Under the License Agreement, the Company was obligated to make upfront payment to Pfizer, as well as potentially additional milestone payments and royalties upon achievement of certain milestones. For further discussion, refer to Item 15— Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies.
Regulatory Pathway
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-marketing may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal fines or penalties. 
The Company's product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with GCD;
•potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.

The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States.
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.

•Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product for its intended use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol.
NDA Review
Following completion of clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information in a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by an application user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a qualifying small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing to determine if they are sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and the FDA may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and priority review. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review priority review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA also closely analyzes the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, including the potential 

requirement to conduct additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing changes. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the Company interprets the same data.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy conducted by or on behalf of the applicant. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application.
505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations, new routes of administration, or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and/or effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s prior findings of safety or effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA concerning each patent listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book). Depending on the type of certification, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product, such as the 5 years of exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit brought by the holder of the listed patent, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the product is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration and drug listing monitoring and record-keeping adverse event and other periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and product promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the NDA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.

FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. The Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of its products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer or the NDA holder, including recalls.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
•suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Other Regulatory Matters
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the 

biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; 
•the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding their payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiology assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; and
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates,” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as analogous state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects pharmaceutical companies, among others, to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of the Company's U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, the Company may apply for restoration of patent term for its currently owned or licensed patents to add 

patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
European Union Drug Development
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. These changes will primarily be introduced under the Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014, which also aims to harmonize the rules for conducting clinical trials across the EU. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, and national implementing legislation, continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations:
•The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant 

as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of the Company's products will depend, in part, on the extent to which its products will be covered by third party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of the Company's products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. The Company may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of its products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require the Company to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of its products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
Moreover, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which the Company receives marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for the Company's products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices it might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of the Company's products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. 
There remain judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when the Supreme Court will make a decision. Although the United States Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is also unclear how such litigation, other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and the Company's business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and other SARS-CoV-2 relief legislation have suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for the Company's drugs, if approved, and accordingly, the Company's financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For 

example, at the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. In addition, the Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. As a result, the FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. In addition, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
The Company expects that additional healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, particularly in response to the recent presidential election. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 
Research and Development
The Company recognized $39.8 million and $33.6 million of research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 62 full-time employees based in the United States, building key capabilities by adding 35 employees since 2019. This talent was hired to support and extend the Company's clinical and preclinical pipeline, as well as develop organizational strength and infrastructure in CMC, selling, general and administrative functions. None of the Company's employees are represented by a labor union or are covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
In response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, the Company implemented changes that it determined to be in the best interest of its employees, as well as the communities in which the Company operates, and which comply with government regulations. The implemented changes included having employees work remotely while management monitored and implemented additional safety measures on-site in preparation for an eventual return to the office.
The Company expects to continue to grow its organizational footprint in 2021 with a focus on expanding its sales force in connection with the anticipated commercial launch of its main candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray in the fourth quarter of 2021, if approved by the FDA. In anticipation of the FDA PDUFA date, the Company projects hiring approximately 150 to 200 sales representatives, in addition to bolstering management and support functions. The Company will continue to evaluate the business needs and market opportunities, balancing in house expertise and core competencies with outsourced capacity. Currently, the Company outsources much of its preclinical and clinical development, as well as manufacturing to contract manufacturers and third party providers. 
Drug development and commercialization requires deep expertise across a broad array of disciplines. Pharmaceutical companies of all sizes compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified candidates, the Company offers an attractive total rewards package, consisting of base salary, cash bonus, a comprehensive benefit package, equity compensation, and 401(k) plan. Bonus opportunities and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility, and actual bonus awards are based on performance.
