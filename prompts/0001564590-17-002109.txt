ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company that has been focused on the development of novel next generation cancer therapeutics. Our mission is to accelerate transformative therapies to improve the lives of people living with cancer and other serious diseases. Our product candidate apatorsen has a distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development that we believe has the potential to improve treatment outcomes in a variety of cancers. Apatorsen is designed to block the production of heat shock protein 27, or Hsp27, a protein that promotes treatment resistance in cancer. In some clinical trials evaluating apatorsen, high serum Hsp27 levels appear to be a strong prognostic indicator for shorter survival outcomes.  We currently do not intend to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies with apatorsen and are seeking a collaboration partnership to fund and further develop this product candidate.   
 As a result of custirsen not meeting the primary endpoint of improving overall survival in three completed phase 3 trials, we have discontinued further development of custirsen and have begun to wind down all clinical trials and other activities related to this product candidate. In November 2016, we provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), or Ionis, and a letter of termination to the University of British Columbia, or UBC, notifying those parties that we have discontinued development of custirsen, resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to custirsen.  In January 2017, we also discontinued further development of our pre-clinical product candidate, OGX-225. We provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis, informing them that we have discontinued development of OGX-225 resulting in termination of the license agreement related to this product candidate. We intend to also terminate the UBC license agreement related to OGX-225, provided that Ionis does not exercise its reversion rights within 90 days of the notice of discontinuance. If Ionis exercises its reversion rights related to OGX-225, we believe Ionis will assume the rights and obligations under the UBC license agreement.   
 In February 2016, we committed to a plan to reduce operating expenses, which included a workforce reduction of 11 employees, representing approximately 27% of our employees prior to the reduction. We incurred approximately $0.4 million in expenses as a result of the workforce reduction, substantially all of which were severance costs.
 In October and November 2016, we committed to a restructuring of an additional portion of our workforce in order to preserve our resources as we determined future strategic plans. As part of these restructurings, we eliminated 19 positions, representing approximately 68% of our workforce. We expect the restructurings to be substantially complete in the first quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we incurred approximately $1.8 million in restructuring costs, substantially all of which related to severance costs, and an asset impairment charge of $0.2 million for manufacturing equipment.
 On January 5, 2017, we and Achieve Life Science, Inc., or Achieve, a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, under which OncoGenex will acquire Achieve in an all-stock transaction. Upon completion of the Merger Agreement, Achieve's stockholders are expected to own 75% of the combined company's outstanding shares and our current equityholders are expected to own the remaining 25% of the combined company's outstanding shares.  Following completion of the merger, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will be renamed Achieve Life Sciences, Inc.
 Pending Merger Agreement with Achieve
 On January 5, 2017, we and Achieve entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Ash Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours will merge with and into Achieve, or the First Merger, with Achieve becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and the surviving company of the First Merger, or the Initial Surviving Corporation. Promptly following the First Merger, the Initial Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Ash Acquisition Sub 2, Inc., or Merger Sub 2, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the surviving entity as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ours. The two mergers taken together, are intended to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 
 3


368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The surviving company is expected to be renamed Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. and is referred to herein as the “combined company.” The Merger is expected to close mid-2017.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the First Merger, each outstanding share of Achieve common stock will be converted into the right to receive approximately 4,242.8904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement based on increases or decreases in Achieve’s fully-diluted capitalization, as well as the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. Immediately following the effective time of the merger, our equityholders are expected to own approximately 25% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, and the Achieve stockholders are expected to own approximately 75% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. 
 Consummation of the merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the stockholders of us and Achieve. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Achieve, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $0.5 million. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that if either party breaches certain covenants regarding alternative transactions to those contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the breaching party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $1.0 million. In connection with certain terminations of the Merger Agreement, either party may be required to pay the other party’s third party expenses up to $0.5 million. 
 At the effective time of the First Merger, our Board of Directors is expected to consist of seven members, three of whom will be designated by us and four of whom will be designated by Achieve. We are expected to designate Scott Cormack, Stewart Parker and Martin Mattingly. Achieve is expected to designate Richard Stewart, Anthony Clark and two other independent directors that have yet to be determined. Additionally, at the effective time of the First Merger, Rick Stewart, the current Chairman of Achieve, is expected to be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company; Anthony Clarke, the current Chief Scientific Officer of Achieve, is expected to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the combined company; and John Bencich, our Chief Financial Officer and Cindy Jacobs, our Chief Medical Officer, are expected to continue to serve the combined company in their respective roles. 
 
In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) certain of our officers and directors, who collectively hold approximately 1.2 percent of the outstanding shares of our capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017, have each entered into a support agreement with Achieve, or the OncoGenex Support Agreements, and (ii) certain officers, directors and stockholders of Achieve, who collectively hold approximately 78 percent of the outstanding shares of Achieve capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017, have each entered into a support agreement with us, or the Achieve Support Agreements, and together with the OncoGenex Support Agreements, the Support Agreements. The Support Agreements include covenants as to the voting of such shares in favor of approving the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against actions that could adversely affect the consummation of the Merger. 
 The Support Agreements will terminate upon the earlier of the consummation of the First Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement by its terms. 
 Concurrently and in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, (i) certain of our officers and directors, who collectively hold approximately 1.2 percent of the outstanding shares of our capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017 and (ii) certain officers, directors and stockholders of Achieve, who collectively hold approximately 78 percent of the outstanding shares of Achieve capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017, have each entered into lock-up agreements with us, pursuant to which, subject to certain exceptions, each stockholder will be subject to a 180-day, or the Lock-Up Period, lock-up on the sale of shares of our capital stock, which Lock-Up Period shall begin upon the consummation of the First Merger. 
 We expect to issue contingent value rights, or each, a CVR and collectively, the CVRs, to our existing stockholders prior to the completion of the First Merger. One CVR will be issued for each share of our common stock outstanding as of the record date for such issuance. Each CVR will be a non-transferable right to potentially receive certain cash, equity or other consideration received by the combined company in the event the combined company receives any such consideration during the five-year period after consummation of the First Merger as a result of the achievement of certain clinical milestones, regulatory milestones, sales-based milestones and/or up-front payment milestones relating to our product candidate apatorsen, or the Milestones, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a contingent value rights agreement to be entered into between us, Achieve and an as of yet unidentified third party, as rights agent, or the CVR Agreement. The aggregate consideration to be distributed to the holders of the CVRs, if any, will be equal to 80% of the consideration received by the combined company as a result of the achievement of the Milestones less certain agreed to offsets, as determined pursuant to the CVR Agreement. Under the CVR Agreement, for a period of six months beginning in February 2017, we will use certain defined efforts to enter into an agreement with a third party regarding the development and/or commercialization of apatorsen. At the expiration of this six-month period, if a third party has not entered into a term sheet for the development or commercialization of apatorsen, the combined company will no longer be contractually required to pursue an agreement regarding apatorsen and no consideration will be payable to the holders of CVRs.

Product Candidate Apatorsen Overview
 Apatorsen is our product candidate that is designed to inhibit production of Hsp27, a cell-survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including bladder, prostate, breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. Hsp27 expression is stress-induced, including by many anti-cancer therapies. Overexpression of Hsp27 is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis and negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types. In some clinical trials evaluating apatorsen, high serum Hsp27 levels at baseline, or at the start of treatment, appear to be a strong prognostic indicator for shorter survival outcomes.
 In 2013, we initiated the ORCA (Ongoing Studies Evaluating Treatment Resistance in CAncer) program which encompasses six phase 2 clinical studies designed to evaluate whether treatment with apatorsen can lead to improved prognosis and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. Five of these trials have been completed and the remaining ongoing trial completed enrollment in 2016 with results expected in 2018.  We currently do not intend to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies with apatorsen and are seeking a collaboration partnership to fund and further develop this product candidate. 
 Custirsen 
 As a result of custirsen not meeting the primary endpoint of improving overall survival in three completed phase 3 trials, we have discontinued further development of custirsen and have begun to wind down all clinical trials and other activities related to this product candidate. In November 2016, we provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis and a letter of termination to UBC, notifying those parties that we have discontinued development of custirsen, resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to custirsen. 
 OGX-225 
 In January 2017, we discontinued further development of our pre-clinical product candidate, OGX-225.  We provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis, notifying them that we have discontinued development of OGX-225 resulting in termination of the license agreement related to this product candidate.  We intend to also terminate the UBC license agreement related to OGX-225 provided that Ionis does not exercise its reversion rights within 90 days of the notice of discontinuance. If Ionis exercises its reversion rights related to OGX-225, we believe Ionis will assume the rights and obligations under the UBC license agreement.
 Financial Overview 
 We have devoted substantially all of our resources to our clinical development programs.
 In 2016, we recognized $5.1 million in collaboration revenue attributable to a collaboration agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva. 
 We incurred a loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $20.1 million and had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2016 of $196.9 million and $27.5 million of total assets. We expect to continue to incur additional losses either in connection with completing the merger and continuing the research and development activities of the combined company’s product candidates or winding down our current product development activities. 
 To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities and payments received from Teva. We will not receive any further payments from Teva.
 Based on our current expectations, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for at least the next 12 months. 
 
OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE - APATORSEN
 Overview of Apatorsen 
 Apatorsen is our product candidate that is designed to inhibit production of Hsp27, a cell-survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including bladder, prostate, breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. Hsp27 expression is stress-induced, including by many anti-cancer therapies. Overexpression of Hsp27 is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis and negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types. In some clinical trials evaluating apatorsen, high serum Hsp27 levels at baseline, or at the start of treatment, appear to be a strong prognostic indicator for shorter survival outcomes.

Apatorsen utilizes second-generation antisense drug chemistry and belongs to the drug class known as antisense therapeutics. We have collaborated with Ionis and selectively licensed technology from Ionis to combine Ionis’ second-generation antisense chemistry with our proprietary gene target sequences to create an inhibitor that is designed to down-regulate Hsp27. In contrast to first-generation antisense chemistry, second-generation antisense chemistry has improved target binding affinity, increased resistance to degradation and improved tissue distribution. These improvements result in slower clearance of the therapies from the body, which allow for less frequent dosing and thereby make treatment easier on patients at a lower associated cost.
 A number of preclinical studies have shown that reducing Hsp27 production induces tumor cell death in prostate, non-small cell lung, bladder and pancreatic cancer cells. The studies also suggest that reducing Hsp27 production sensitizes prostate tumor cells to hormone ablation therapy. These preclinical studies have also shown that inhibiting the production of Hsp27 in human prostate, bladder, lung, breast, ovarian and pancreatic tumor cells sensitizes the cells to chemotherapy. 
 Hsp27 has been reported by others to function as an immunomodulatory protein by a number of mechanisms that include altering important membrane-expressed proteins on monocytes and immature dendritic cells; this alteration results in tumor-associated immune cells that are not functional in identifying and killing cancer cells. The induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines by Hsp27 may also play a role in down-regulating lymphocyte activation leading to additional unresponsive immune cells.
 In 2013, we initiated the ORCA (Ongoing Studies Evaluating Treatment Resistance in CAncer) program which encompasses six phase 2 clinical studies designed to evaluate whether treatment with apatorsen can lead to improved prognosis and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. Five of these trials have been completed and the remaining ongoing trial completed enrollment in 2016 with results expected in 2018.  We currently do not intend to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies with apatorsen and are seeking a collaboration partnership to fund and further develop this product candidate.

Summary of Ongoing Trial
 The Spruce-2™ Trial (formerly referred to as the Cedar Trial) is an investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen plus gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy or gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy alone in patients with previously untreated advanced squamous NSCLC. Patients also continue weekly apatorsen infusions as maintenance treatment after chemotherapy until disease progression. The aim of the trial is to determine if adding apatorsen to gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy can extend progression free survival, or PFS, outcome. Additional analyses will include tumor response rates, overall survival, safety, and health-related quality of life, as well as to determine the effect of Hsp27 levels on clinical outcomes, explore potential biomarkers that may help predict response to treatment and survival outcomes in patients who were at increased risk for poor outcomes. The trial was initiated in July 2014 and completed enrollment in December 2016. During the conduct of the trial, two amendments were submitted: one that reduced the apatorsen dose to 400mg and the second that reduced patient enrollment to ~90 patients. The trial completed patient enrollment in December 2016 and results are expected in 2018. The trial is an investigator-sponsored trial being conducted and funded primarily by the UK National Cancer Research Network and the UK Experimental Cancer Medicine Network.

Summary of Completed Apatorsen Clinical Trials 
 The following is a summary of the preliminary or final results from completed apatorsen clinical trials. 
 Summary of Borealis-2 Results - The Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Metastatic Bladder Cancer who have disease progression following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy
 Borealis-2 randomized 200 patients with metastatic bladder cancer whose disease had progressed following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel in combination with 600mg apatorsen or docetaxel alone. Patients could receive up to 10 cycles of docetaxel. Apatorsen maintenance could continue beyond docetaxel treatment until disease progression, toxicity, or study withdrawal. The primary endpoint analysis was a superiority test for overall survival, performed at a one-sided 0.10 significance level using a stratified log-rank test. Secondary endpoints included PFS, disease response and safety assessments. The Borealis-2 trial was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by the Hoosier Cancer Research Network at 28 sites across the United States.
 In October 2016, we announced that the trial met its primary endpoint of improving survival at the one-sided 0.10 significance level. Patients who received apatorsen treatment experienced a 20% reduction in risk of death, compared to patients receiving docetaxel alone (overall survival hazard ratio (HR)=0.80; 80% CI: 0.65-0.98; p=0.078). In February 2017, results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Apatorsen was well tolerated in combination with docetaxel. The reduction in risk of progression or death was also 20% for patients receiving apatorsen in combination with docetaxel, compared to docetaxel alone (PFS HR= 0.80; 80% CI: 0.64-1.01; p=0.107). Partial or complete responses occurred in 16.2% patients receiving apatorsen plus docetaxel compared to 10.9% patients receiving docetaxel alone with median response durations of 6.2 months versus 4.4 months, respectively.  Overall for the study, higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were significantly prognostic for indicating an almost 2-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.96; p=0.0001). In an exploratory analysis on a subset of patients (20% of total) who completed at least two treatment cycles and had either a decrease in serum Hsp27 levels from baseline or had only a 20.5% increase in serum Hsp27 levels from baseline, the reduction in risk of death with apatorsen treatment was 71% (HR= 0.29: 80% CI: 0.18-0.48; interaction p=0.0727).
 Summary of Borealis-1 Results - The Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Metastatic Bladder Cancer
 Borealis-1 randomized 183 patients with documented metastatic or locally inoperable transitional cell carcinoma, or TCC, of the urinary tract who had not previously received chemotherapy for metastatic disease and were not candidates for potentially curative surgery or radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin) in combination with apatorsen at two dose levels (600 mg and 1000 mg) or gemcitabine/cisplatin plus placebo. Patients received up to six cycles of weekly intravenous therapy. Patients received weekly apatorsen or placebo maintenance therapy until disease progression or other reason for withdrawal from protocol treatment if they had completed a minimum of four cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included PFS, disease response and safety assessments for the two doses of apatorsen. The trial was conducted by OncoGenex as a company-sponsored trial at 50 sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe.  
 In December 2014, we announced overall trial results that the addition of 600mg apatorsen to standard of care chemotherapy showed a 14% reduction in risk of death (HR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.54-1.36; p=0.252) when compared to chemotherapy alone. Subsequent exploratory analyses showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared to placebo (HR=0.72; 95% CI: 0.35–1.45). In general for the study, higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were significantly prognostic for indicating a 2-fold higher risk of death (HR= 2.01; p=0.0004). Further exploratory analysis of serum Hsp27 levels showed a trend towards survival benefit for the poor-prognosis patients in apatorsen 600 mg and 1000 mg arms who achieved lower overall (area-under-the-curve) serum Hsp27 levels during study treatment, compared to similar patients in the placebo arm (HR=0.45 and 0.62, respectively). Less benefit was believed to be observed in the 1000mg apatorsen arm due to increased adverse events leading to a higher rate of discontinuation of both apatorsen and chemotherapy. Apatorsen 600mg was well tolerated in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy. These data were presented at the 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting. 
 Summary of Spruce Results - The Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
 Spruce randomized 155 patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. Patients were randomized to receive apatorsen in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy compared to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy alone. Patients were to continue pemetrexed with weekly apatorsen or placebo infusions as maintenance treatment until disease progression if they completed a minimum of 3 cycles of chemotherapy treatment. The aim of the trial was to determine if adding apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy could extend PFS outcome. The study was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by sites under the Sarah Cannon Research Institute.

In January 2016, the primary endpoint data for PFS was reported to have not reached the statistical significance required to demonstrate a benefit (PFS HR= 0.90; 80% CI 0.71-1.14; p=0.557). In the study, higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were found to be significantly prognostic for indicating an almost 2-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.98; p=0.0034). A potential benefit was observed in a subgroup of patients with high baseline serum Hsp27 status (~10% of total) when treated with apatorsen (PFS HR= 0.462; 80% CI: 0.193- 1.106). Study follow up with survival results was completed at the end of 2016. The addition of apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy did not demonstrate an overall survival benefit in the study (HR= 1.067; 80% CI: 0.838-1.359). PFS results were presented at ASCO 2016. The study investigators concluded that apatorsen and pemetrexed/carboplatin therapy was well tolerated and showed promising PFS results in the treatment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC who have Hsp27 high status and thus warranted further study in this population. We do not intend to pursue additional trials in non-squamous NSCLC at this time.
 Summary of Rainier Results - The Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
 Rainier randomized 132 patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients were randomized to receive apatorsen in combination with ABRAXANE® (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone. Patients were to receive up to six cycles of weekly intravenous therapy. The aim of the trial was to determine if adding apatorsen to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine could extend overall survival. The study was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by sites under the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. 
 In September 2015, we announced that the primary survival endpoint did not show improved survival for patients receiving apatorsen plus ABRAXANE and gemcitabine when compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone (HR= 1.098; 95% CI 0.759-1.590). Similarly there was no improvement in PFS (PFS HR=1.020; 95% CI 0.806-1.290). The study did show that higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were significantly prognostic for indicating a 1.8-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.84; p=0.0041). A potential benefit was observed in a subgroup of patients with high baseline serum Hsp27 status (14% of total) when treated with apatorsen (PFS HR= 0.381; 95% CI 0.120-1.208 and survival HR= 0.587; 95% CI 0.195-1.770). The study was presented at the Gastrointestinal, or GI, Cancers Symposium meeting in January 2016. The study investigators concluded that apatorsen and ABRAXANE/gemcitabine was well tolerated and that the promising results in pancreatic cancer patients with high baseline Hsp27 status warrant further study of apatorsen in this population. We do not intend to pursue additional trials in pancreatic cancer at this time.
 Summary of Pacific Results - The Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with metastatic CRPC 
 Pacific randomized 72 patients who were experiencing a rising PSA while receiving Zytiga® (abiraterone acetate). The aim of the trial was to determine if adding apatorsen to Zytiga treatment could reverse or delay treatment resistance by evaluating the PFS rate at a milestone Day 60 assessment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were progression free (clinical and radiologic) at study day 60. Other secondary endpoints were PSA and objective responses, time to disease progression, circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, and Hsp27 levels. The Pacific trial was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by the Hoosier Cancer Research Network at sites in Canada and the United States.
 In February 2017, results were presented at the ASCO 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Apatorsen was well tolerated in combination with Zytiga with the median treatment duration of 106 days for apatorsen plus Zytiga compared to 75 days for continuing Zytiga alone. The proportion of patients who were progression free at Day 60 was 33% when apatorsen was added to Zytiga, compared to 17% with Zytiga alone (p=0.17). The median time of PFS was 8.6 weeks for apatorsen treatment, compared to 7.9 weeks for Zytiga. A 50% or greater decline in PSA levels was seen in 6% of patients when apatorsen was added to Zytiga compared to 3% with continuing Zytiga alone. Stable disease or partial response was seen in 20% of patients when apatorsen was added to Zytiga vs 14% with Zytiga alone. For patients with ≥5 CTCs at baseline, 22% vs 11% of patients had a CTC reduction to less than 5 CTCs when apatorsen was added to Zytiga vs Zytiga alone, respectively.
 Summary of Results of Apatorsen Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with CRPC 
 This randomized, controlled phase 2 trial completed enrollment of 74 patients who had minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate cancer and who have not yet received chemotherapy. The trial was designed to determine the potential benefit of apatorsen by assessing the number of patients without disease progression at 12 weeks post-study treatment with or without apatorsen. Preliminary study results presented at ESMO in September 2012 showed a higher number of patients without disease progression at 12 weeks and greater declines in PSA and CTCs in patients receiving apatorsen plus prednisone treatment compared to those receiving prednisone alone. Apatorsen was well tolerated in combination with prednisone.

Summary of Results of Apatorsen Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Patients with Superficial Bladder Cancer 
 This investigator-sponsored phase 1 trial was designed to determine the effects of apatorsen on Hsp27 expression and tumor response rates when administered into the bladder using intravesical instillation. In addition, the trial measured the direct effect of delivering apatorsen by intravesical instillation on expression of Hsp27 in bladder tumor cells. This clinical trial was primarily funded by the National Cancer Institute of Canada. 
 Preliminary results from this trial were presented at the ASCO 2012 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2012 and demonstrated a trend towards decreased levels of Hsp27 and increased tumor cell death rates after intravesical treatment with apatorsen. In the apatorsen treated patients who experienced a complete pathologic response, the absence of residual disease made it difficult to fully assess the effect of apatorsen on Hsp27 expression. Therefore, the analysis was based mainly on the remaining patients who had evaluable tumor tissue. Results showed that eight of 24 patients (33%) had no pathologic evidence of disease.
 Summary of Results of Apatorsen Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Patients with Solid Tumors 
 Apatorsen has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with breast, prostate, ovarian, or NSCLC who have failed potentially curative treatments or for whom a curative treatment does not exist. Final results of this phase 1 trial were presented in an oral presentation at the ASCO 2010 annual meeting. The phase 1 trial evaluated 42 patients treated with apatorsen as a single agent and 22 patients treated with apatorsen in combination with docetaxel who had failed up to six prior chemotherapy treatments. Apatorsen as a single agent administered weekly was evaluated at doses from 200 mg up to 1000 mg in five cohorts of approximately six patients per cohort. Two further cohorts evaluated apatorsen at the 800 and 1000 mg doses combined with docetaxel. Patients could receive up to 10 21-day cycles. 
 Most adverse events were mild (grade 1 or 2) and mainly occurred during the three “loading doses” given over nine days prior to weekly dosing. The most frequently reported adverse events in the apatorsen monotherapy arms were infusion-related reactions and chills. The most frequently reported adverse events in the apatorsen plus docetaxel arms were infusion-related reactions, chills, fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus (itching), nausea and back pain. The incidence of laboratory toxicity was determined based on laboratory data. The majority of laboratory toxicities were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Serious adverse events were reported for approximately half the patients. The most common events were disease progression and dyspnea (shortness of breath), reported for five subjects each, and febrile neutropenia, reported for four subjects. Increased blood creatinine (a test of kidney function) and hydronephrosis (obstruction of the urine flow from the kidney due to tumor blockage) were reported for two subjects each. All remaining serious adverse events were reported for one subject each. 
 Thirty patients had baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of measurable disease. A total of eight of 30 patients (27%) had a decrease in measurable disease from baseline of at least 15%. For patients treated with monotherapy, three patients had tumor reductions and for patients treated with combined therapy with docetaxel, five patients had tumor reductions. 
 Thirty-three of 36 patients with prostate cancer had at least one post-baseline PSA. Three of 21 in the monotherapy cohorts had reductions in PSA greater than or equal to 30% as did six of 12 in the combination therapy cohorts. Six of seven patients with ovarian cancer had both baseline and post-baseline CA-125 (an ovarian tumor marker) measurements. All were treated with monotherapy. Three patients had a reduction of CA-125. 
 Decreases in both total CTCs and Hsp27+CTCs were observed. Hsp27+CTCs were decreased in 71% of evaluable patients. 
 In approximately 35% of patients, serum Hsp27 protein levels were decreased by 30% or greater over a time period of at least six weeks. 
 OVERVIEW OF MARKET AND TREATMENT 
 In North America, cancer has recently surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths. Approximately 600,000 Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2017. 
 Typically, cancer treatments are given sequentially and can include hormone therapy, surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Although a particular therapy may initially be effective, tumor cells often react to therapeutic treatment by increasing the production of proteins that afford them a survival advantage, enabling them to become resistant to therapy, multiply, and spread to additional organs. As a result, many patients progress through multiple different therapies and ultimately die from the disease.

LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS 
 Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Apatorsen 
 In January 2005, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ionis to jointly identify antisense compounds designed to inhibit the production of proteins encoded by specified gene targets. We are solely responsible for all product development activities for antisense compounds under this collaboration. This relationship provides us with access to Ionis’ proprietary position in second generation antisense chemistry for use in specified products. We were permitted to designate up to two collaboration gene targets for collaborative research, development and commercialization. In April, 2005, Hsp27 was confirmed as a collaboration gene target, and we and Ionis jointly designed and screened antisense compounds for this gene target. Our right to designate a second collaboration gene target expired on January 5, 2007. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, in the event that we abandon apatorsen, Ionis may elect to unilaterally continue development of apatorsen, in which case we must provide Ionis with a worldwide license or sublicense (as the case may be) of our relevant technology solely to develop and commercialize apatorsen in exchange for a royalty on Ionis’ sales of apatorsen. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we may be obligated to make certain milestone payments to Ionis contingent upon the occurrence of certain clinical development and regulatory events related to apatorsen. We are also obligated to pay to Ionis certain milestone payments, as well as certain low to mid-single digit royalties on net sales for apatorsen, with the amount of royalties depending on whether third-party royalty payments are owed. We paid Ionis USD$0.8 million in 2010 upon the initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial of apatorsen in patients with CRPC. We did not make any royalty payments to Ionis under the terms of the agreement in 2016. 
 We have agreed to indemnify Ionis and certain persons affiliated with Ionis against liabilities caused by us and our licensees’ and sublicensees’ gross negligence or willful misconduct, our material breach of the collaboration and license agreement, and the manufacture, use, handling, storage, sale or other disposition of apatorsen that is sold by us or our affiliates, agents or sublicensees. 
 The term of the collaboration and license agreement will continue for each product until the later of 10 years after the date of the first commercial sale of apatorsen and the expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell apatorsen, unless we abandon apatorsen and Ionis does not elect to unilaterally continue development of apatorsen.
 
Custirsen 
 In November 2016, we provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis notifying them that we have discontinued development of custirsen, resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to custirsen. We believe that all financial obligations, other than continuing mutual indemnification obligations and our requirement to pay for out-of-pocket patent expenses incurred up to the date of termination and for abandoning the custirsen patents and patent applications, under all agreements with Ionis, including the Ionis settlement agreement, are no longer owed and no further payments are due. 
 OGX-225
 In January 2017, we discontinued further development of OGX-225.  We provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis, notifying them that we have discontinued development of OGX-225 resulting in termination of the license agreement related to this product candidate.  We intend to also terminate the UBC license agreement related to OGX-225 provided that Ionis does not exercise its reversion rights within 90 days of the notice of discontinuance. If Ionis exercises its reversion rights related to OGX-225, we believe Ionis will assume the rights and obligations under the UBC license agreement.
University of British Columbia 
 Apatorsen 
 Under a license agreement entered into in April 2005, as amended, UBC granted to us an exclusive, worldwide license to commercialize its existing intellectual property and any improvements related to Hsp27. This technology, combined with Ionis’ second-generation antisense chemistry, is our product candidate apatorsen. In connection with entering into the license agreement, we issued to UBC shares that were exchanged in the Arrangement for 6,533 shares of our common stock. We also agreed to pay UBC low single digit royalties on the revenue from sales of apatorsen, which royalty rate may be reduced in the event that we must pay additional royalties under patent licenses entered into with third parties in order to manufacture, use or sell apatorsen. We may be obligated to make milestone payments to UBC contingent upon the occurrence of certain clinical development and regulatory events 
 11


related to apatorsen. We are obligated to pay UBC CAD$2,000 in annual maintenance fees. We paid UBC CAD$0.1 million in 2010 in relation to the initiation of a phase 2 trial of apatorsen in patients with CRPC. The occurrence and receipt of upfront and milestone payments and the generation of royalty revenue are uncertain. We did not make any royalty payments to UBC under the terms of the agreement in 2016.
 Subject to certain exceptions, we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop and exploit the licensed technology and any improvements and (ii) promote, market and sell any resulting products. We are permitted to sublicense the technology, subject to certain consent and other requirements. We direct patent prosecution and are responsible for all fees and costs related to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights underlying the license agreement. We indemnify UBC and certain of UBC’s affiliates against liability arising out of the exercise of any rights granted pursuant to the agreement. The term of the agreement will expire on the later of 20 years from its effective date and the expiration of the last patent licensed under the agreement. Depending on the outcome of the pending patent applications in the licensed patent family, and subject to any applicable patent term extensions, a patent issuing from this family would expire in all jurisdictions by 2023. We may also file additional patent applications related to Hsp27 that could potentially extend the expiration date of the last to expire patent in this area. 
 
Custirsen 
 In November 2016, we provided a letter of termination to UBC notifying them that we have discontinued development of custirsen, resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to custirsen. We believe that all financial obligations, other than continuing mutual indemnification obligations and our requirement to pay for out-of-pocket patent expenses incurred up to the date of termination and for abandoning the custirsen patents and patent applications, under all agreements with UBC, are no longer owed and no further payments are due. 
 OGX-225
 In January 2017, we discontinued further development of OGX-225.  We provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis, notifying them that we have discontinued development of OGX-225 resulting in termination of the license agreement related to this product candidate. We intend to also terminate the UBC license agreement related to OGX-225 provided that Ionis does not exercise its reversion rights within 90 days of the notice of discontinuance. If Ionis exercises its reversion rights related to OGX-225, we believe Ionis will assume the rights and obligations under the UBC license agreement.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 Drug Approval Process 
 Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the production and marketing of our products. In order to undertake clinical trials and to produce and market products for human use, mandatory procedures and safety standards established by the FDA in the United States and by comparable agencies in other countries must be followed. 
 12


The standard process before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed includes the following steps: 
  
• | preclinical studies, including laboratory evaluation and animal studies to test for initial safety and efficacy;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to national health authorities of an IND or Clinical Trials Application, or CTA, or equivalent dossier, which must be accepted by each national health authority before human clinical trials may commence in that country;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in its intended population and use(s);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to appropriate national and/or regional regulatory health authorities of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or equivalent marketing authorization application, which application is not automatically accepted for review; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by appropriate regulatory health authorities of the marketing authorization application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug in each country or jurisdiction.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As part of the regulatory health authority approval for each product, the drug-manufacturing establishment is subject to inspection by the FDA and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements applicable to the production of pharmaceutical drug products. The facilities, procedures and operations of manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the active drug substance and its formulation in animals to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the drug and its formulation. Prior to initiating the first clinical testing of a new drug product candidate, the results of the preclinical studies are submitted to regulatory health authorities as part of an IND or CTA, and must be accepted before the proposed clinical trial(s) can begin. 
 Clinical trials for cancer therapeutics involve the administration of the investigational drug to patients with a defined disease state, under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. 
 Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy. Each protocol is submitted to regulatory health authorities as part of the IND or CTA in each country where clinical trials are to be conducted. Each clinical trial is approved and monitored by independent Institutional Review Boards, or IRB, or Ethics Committees who consider ethical factors, informed consent documents, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institutions conducting a clinical trial. The IRB or Ethics Committee may require changes in the clinical trials protocol, which may delay initiation or completion of the trial. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug to humans, the drug is tested for safety and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 trials involve more detailed evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the drug in patients with a defined disease. Phase 3 trials consist of large-scale evaluations of safety and efficacy of the investigational drug compared to accepted standard therapy in a defined disease. 
 The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for a new product takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The FDA, or another regulatory authority, may not grant approval on a timely basis, if at all. We may encounter difficulties in securing regulatory approval or unanticipated costs, which may delay or preclude the commercialization, if any, of apatorsen or future product candidates. For instance, regulatory authorities may conclude that the data submitted in a marketing authorization application, such as a NDA, are not adequate to support approval of a pharmaceutical agent and may require further clinical and preclinical testing, re-submission of the application, and further review. Even after initial approval has been obtained, an indication may be limited or conditioned on the provision of further studies to support an approved indication, and further studies will be required to gain approval for the use of a product for clinical indications other than those for which the product was approved initially. Also, regulatory authorities require post-marketing surveillance programs to monitor the drug product’s side effects. 
 Marketing of pharmaceutical products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. In the European Union, the general trend has been towards coordination of common standards for clinical testing of new drug products. Centralized approval in the European Union is coordinated through the EMA. 
 The level of regulation outside the United States and the European Union varies widely. The time required to obtain regulatory approval from regulatory agencies in each country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EMA approval. In addition, in certain markets, reimbursement is subject to governmentally mandated prices.

CONTRACT RESEARCH AGREEMENTS 
 Our strategy is to outsource certain product development activities and have established contract research agreements for, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and some data management services. We choose which business or institution to use for these services based on their expertise, capacity and reputation and the cost of the service. 
 We also provide or have provided quantities of our product candidates to academic research institutions to investigate the mechanism of action and evaluate novel combinations of product candidates with other cancer therapies in various cancer indications. These collaborations expand our research activities for our product candidates with modest contribution from us. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES 
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our expenditures for research and development activities were $14.8 million, $25.1 million and $46.2 million, respectively. Such research and development expenses primarily related to the advancement of our product candidates custirsen and apatorsen. 
MANUFACTURING 
 We do not own facilities for the manufacture of materials for clinical or commercial use. We rely and expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidate in accordance with cGMP, for use in clinical trials, as well as for process development as required. 
 To date, all active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and drug product for apatorsen has been manufactured by third parties on a purchase order basis, under cGMP. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our success depends in part on our ability and that of our collaborators to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidate, technology, and know-how, to prevent others from infringing on the proprietary rights of our product candidate, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. 
Patents 
 We have a license from UBC and Ionis to use, make, have made, or make improvements upon apatorsen. In addition, we have a pending family of applications on an apatorsen formulation.
 We have been granted non-exclusive rights to all intellectual property owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Ionis as of the date of our agreements with Ionis that relate to second-generation antisense chemistry and that are required for apatorsen. Ionis is generally restricted from engaging in research, development and commercialization of antisense compounds related to Hsp27, other than as provided in the collaboration and license agreement related to each target. Ionis directs patent prosecution and is responsible for all fees and costs related to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of these patent rights, which extend to numerous jurisdictions throughout the world. Individual patents have terms of protection depending on the laws of the countries in which the applications are made. 
 We direct patent prosecution, and are responsible for all fees and costs related to the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights for intellectual property under license from UBC covering apatorsen. We file patent applications for this intellectual property in the United States, Canada, Europe (through the European Patent Office), Japan and other jurisdictions. 
 Composition of matter patents covering apatorsen have been issued in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. Additional patent applications covering all of these products, as well as other technologies, are pending in the United States and certain other countries. 
 Generally, patents issued in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date, if the application from which the patent issues was filed on or after June 8, 1995 (otherwise the term is the longer of 17 years from the issue date and 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date). The duration of patent terms for non-U.S. patents is typically 20 years from the earliest corresponding national or international filing date. Our licensed UBC patent estate related to apatorsen, based on those patents that exist now, will expire in 2023, which does not include extensions that may be available or patent applications that are currently pending. Patent term extensions, specifically to make up for regulatory delays, are available in the United States, Europe and Japan. 
 14


Although we believe that some or all patents related to apatorsen will meet the criteria for patent term extensions, we can provide no assurance that we will obtain such extensions. 
 We also rely on unpatented trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants in our drug development research. We can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Further, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to protect our trade secrets or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques. 
 Trademarks 
 We own several trademarks registered in the United States, including word marks ONCOGENEX™, ORCA™, Spruce™, and design marks ORCA, Pacific, Borealis-1, Borealis-2, and the helical totem element that accompanies the clinical trial trademarked identifiers. In Canada, we have corresponding trademark registrations. 
 
We can provide no assurance that our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names will not infringe upon third-party rights or will be acceptable to regulatory agencies. 
 COMPETITION 
 The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and marketing products designed to address cancer indications for which we are currently developing products or for which we may develop products in the future. We are aware of several other companies which are developing therapeutics that seek to promote tumor cell death. Several therapies have been recently approved by the FDA, and we expect more to be approved in the future. 
 Many oncology drugs in clinical trials are being developed for bladder, lung and prostate cancers. Certain of these drugs are designed, like apatorsen, to interfere with mechanisms potentially involved with treatment resistance. If new drugs are approved for sale for the indications that we are evaluating apatorsen, whether or not they are targeting mechanisms of treatment resistance, in advance of apatorsen or even after its commercialization, the market’s interest in apatorsen may be reduced or eliminated. We are aware of several other companies developing therapeutic products, whether antisense or otherwise, which seek to promote tumor cell death by inhibiting proteins believed to promote cell survival. Our competitors may seek to identify gene sequences, protein targets or antisense chemistry different from ours, and outside the scope of our intellectual property protection, to develop antisense therapeutics that serve the same function as apatorsen. Our competitors may also seek to use mechanisms other than antisense to inhibit the proteins that apatorsen is designed to inhibit. 
 Apatorsen has been evaluated in bladder, prostate, pancreas and lung cancer indications. Substantial advancements in the treatment of each of these cancers has occurred in the past several years and new products from our competitors have been approved for marketing on the basis of showing a survival advantage. Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and expertise than we do in manufacturing and developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. These entities also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring products and technologies complementary to our programs. Standard treatments vary considerably by cancer indication, and new drugs may be more effective in treating one cancer indication than another. In addition, cancer is a difficult disease to treat and it is likely that no one therapeutic will replace all other therapies in any particular indication. Therapeutic strategies for treating cancer are increasingly focused on combining a number of drugs in order to yield the best results. Since apatorsen can potentially be used in multiple cancer indications and target the tumors’ adaptive survival mechanisms, it may potentially be synergistic with many new and currently marketed therapies. The ability for apatorsen to be developed and compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to find a collaboration partner willing to fund the future development and commercialization of this product candidate and for that collaboration partner, if any, to: 
  
• | maintain or establish development programs in combination with new agents that may replace or diminish the markets for which we are currently developing apatorsen;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish that apatorsen is well tolerated and result in a clinical benefit when administered to cancer patients;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish that apatorsen addresses significant unmet needs for patients, resulting in prioritization of apatorsen over other treatment options;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advance the development of apatorsen, including the enrollment of patients for our clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15


 
• | gain regulatory approval for apatorsen in its first indication as well as expand into additional indications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | commercialize apatorsen successfully, which includes convincing physicians, insurers and other third-party payors of the advantages of apatorsen over current therapies, when and if they have advantages; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain intellectual property protection and protect the exclusivity for apatorsen, when and if we have any.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
