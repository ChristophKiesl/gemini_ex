ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. ("JKHY") was founded in 1976 as a provider of core information processing solutions for banks. Today, the Company’s extensive array of products and services includes processing transactions, automating business processes, and managing information for nearly 8,400 financial institutions and diverse corporate entities.
JKHY provides its products and services through three primary business brands:
•Jack Henry Banking is a leading provider of integrated data processing systems to nearly 1,000 banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions with assets of up to $50 billion. The number of banks we serve has decreased in the last year due to acquisitions and mergers within the banking industry, which are discussed further under the heading "Industry Background" in this Item 1. Our banking solutions support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments with three functionally distinct core processing platforms and more than 140 integrated complementary solutions.
•Symitar is a leading provider of core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, with over 700 credit union customers. Symitar markets one flagship core processing platform and more than 100 integrated complementary solutions that support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments.
•ProfitStars is a leading provider of highly specialized core agnostic products and services for financial institutions. ProfitStars' more than 100 integrated complementary solutions offer highly specialized financial performance, imaging and payments processing, information security and risk management, retail delivery, and online and mobile solutions. ProfitStars’ products and services enhance the performance of traditional financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and non-traditional diverse corporate entities with over 8,300 customers, comprised of over 1,600 of our core customers included in our bank and credit union customers listed above, as well as nearly 6,700 non-core customers.
Our products and services provide our customers solutions that can be tailored to support their unique growth, service, operational, and performance goals. Our solutions also enable financial institutions to offer the high-demand products and services required by their customers to compete more successfully, and to capitalize on evolving trends shaping the financial services industry.
We are committed to exceeding our customers’ service-related expectations. We measure and monitor customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and online surveys initiated each day randomly by routine support requests. We believe the results of this extensive survey process confirm that our service consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates excellent customer retention rates.
We also focus on establishing long-term customer relationships, continually expanding and strengthening those relationships with cross sales of additional products and services, earning new traditional and nontraditional clients, and ensuring each product offering is highly competitive.
The majority of our revenue is derived from support and services provided to our on-premise customers that are typically on a one-year contract, private cloud services for our hosted customers that are typically on a seven-year or greater contract, and recurring electronic payment solutions that are also generally on a contract term of seven years or greater. Less predictable software license fees, paid by customers implementing our software solutions on-premise, and hardware sales, including all non-software products that we re-market in order to support our software systems, complement our primary revenue sources. Information regarding the classification of our business into four separate segments is set forth in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements (see Item 8).
JKHY’s progress and performance have been guided by the focused work ethic and fundamental ideals fostered by the Company’s founders 45 years ago:
•Do the right thing,
•Do whatever it takes, and
•Have fun.
We recognize that our associates and their collective contribution are ultimately responsible for JKHY’s past, present, and future success. Recruiting and retaining high-quality employees is essential to our ongoing growth and financial performance, and we believe we have established a corporate culture that sustains high levels of employee satisfaction. For further discussion of our human capital considerations, see "Human Capital" below.
COVID-19 Impact and Response
Since its outbreak in early 2020, COVID-19 has rapidly spread and continues to represent a public health concern. The health, safety, and well-being of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us. In March 
2020, we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the COVID-19 situation and recommend Company actions. We offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allowed them to work off-site and we suspended all non-essential business travel. This company-wide recommendation extended until July 1, 2021, at which point we began transition to a return to our facilities and normalization of travel activities. Individual decisions on returning to the office were manager-coordinated and based on conversations with specific teams and departments. A large number of our employees requested to remain fully remote or participate in a hybrid approach where they would split their time between remote and in-person working. We have not required employees who return to our facilities to receive vaccinations, but we have provided information on vaccine providers, as well as hosted on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics at several of our facilities for our employees and their families. On August 3, 2021, we reimplemented our company-wide recommendation for remote work and are encouraging a cautious approach to business travel based on the spread of the Delta variant and increased infection rates. For those employees who are at our facilities, we have introduced enhanced sanitation procedures and we require face masks for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees. As of August 13, 2021, the majority of our employees were continuing to work remotely either full time or in a hybrid capacity.
Customers
We work closely with our customers who are scheduled for on-site visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site. Delays of customer system installations due to COVID-19 have been limited, and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available. We expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been curtailed, we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations. We believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely without materially impacting our business.
Financial impact
Despite the changes and restrictions caused by COVID-19, the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity, balance sheet, and business trends remain strong. We experienced positive operating cash flows during fiscal 2021, and we do not expect that to change in the near term. However, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of COVID-19 due to a number of uncertainties, including further government actions; the duration, severity and recurrence of the outbreak, including the onset of variants of the virus; the speed and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment developments; the speed of economic recovery; the potential impact to our customers, vendors, and employees; and how the potential impact might affect future customer services, processing and installation-related revenue, and processes and efficiencies within the Company directly or indirectly impacting financial results. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 and its possible impact on the Company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with COVID-19, see Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Background 
Jack Henry Banking primarily serves commercial banks and savings institutions with up to $50 billion in assets. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), there were approximately 4,950 commercial banks and savings institutions in this asset range as of December 31, 2020. Jack Henry Banking currently supports nearly 1,000 of these banks with its core information processing platforms and complementary products and services. 
Symitar serves credit unions of all asset sizes. According to the Credit Union National Association (“CUNA”), there were more than 5,200 domestic credit unions as of December 31, 2020. Symitar currently supports over 700 of these credit unions with core information processing platforms and complementary products and services.
ProfitStars serves financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters and other diverse corporate entities. ProfitStars currently supports over 8,300 institutions with specialized solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security, mitigating operational risks, and controlling operating costs.
The FDIC reports the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined 19% from the beginning of calendar year 2015 to the end of calendar year 2020, due mainly to mergers. Although the number of banks declined at a 4% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 7.0% and totaled $20.5 trillion as of December 31, 2020. There were six new bank charters issued in calendar year 2020, compared to thirteen in the 2019 calendar year. Comparing calendar years 2020 to 2019, the number of mergers decreased 54%.
CUNA reports the number of credit unions declined 15% from the beginning of calendar year 2015 to the end of calendar year 2020. Although the number of credit unions declined at a 3% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 9% and totaled $1.9 trillion as of December 31, 2020.
Community and mid-tier banks and credit unions are important in the communities and to the consumers they serve. Bank customers and credit union members rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the customer’s delivery channel of choice. Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining customers/members in today’s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near-term and long-term performance goals are often technology dependent. Financial institutions must implement technological solutions that enable them to:
•Implement e-commerce, mobile, and digital strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today’s financial services industry;
•Maximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information;
•Offer the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional competitors and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry;
•Enhance the customer/member experience at varied points of contact;
•Expand existing customer/member relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services;
•Capitalize on new revenue and deposit growth opportunities;
•Increase operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs;
•Protect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure;
•Protect customers/members with various security tools from fraud and related financial losses;
•Maximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments; and
•Ensure full regulatory compliance.
JKHY’s extensive product and service offerings enable diverse financial institutions to capitalize on these business opportunities and respond to these business challenges. We strive to establish a long-term, value-added technology partnership with each customer, and to continually expand our offerings with the specific solutions our customers need to prosper in the evolving financial services industry.
Mission Statement
Our mission is to provide quality solutions and industry-leading service to our customers while fostering our culture that is personally, professionally, and financially rewarding to our employees and increasing the value of our stockholders' investments.
Business Strategy
Our fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth augmented by strategic acquisitions. We execute this strategy by:
•Providing commercial banks and credit unions with core operating systems that provide excellent functionality and support on-premise and private cloud delivery environments with identical functionality.
•Expanding each core customer relationship by cross-selling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems.
•Providing highly specialized core agnostic complementary products and services to financial institutions, including institutions not utilizing a Jack Henry core operating system, and diverse corporate entities.
•Maintaining a company-wide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention.
•Capitalizing on our acquisition strategy.
Acquisition Strategy
We have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 34 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999. We continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to: 
•Expand our suite of complementary products and services;
•Provide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and non-core customers and outside our base to new customers; and/or
•Provide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry. 
We have completed three acquisitions in the last 3 years. After 45 years in business, we have very few gaps in our product line, so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues. In addition, we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions. 
We have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction, complement and accelerate our organic growth, and generate long-term profitable growth for our shareholders. While we seek to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, we will continue to explore alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our shareholders, such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers, repurchases of our stock, and continued payment of dividends.
Our most recent acquisitions were:

Fiscal Year | Company or Product Name | Products and Services 
2020 | DebtFolio, Inc. ("Geezeo") | Provider of technology solutions and next-generation financial management capabilities primarily for the financial services industry
2019 | BOLTS Technologies, Inc. ("BOLTS") | Developer of boltsOPEN, a digital account opening solution 
2019 | Agiletics, Inc. ("Agiletics") | Provider of escrow, investment, and liquidity management solutions for banks serving commercial customers 

Solutions
Our proprietary solutions are marketed through three primary business brands: 
•Jack Henry Banking supports commercial banks with information and transaction processing platforms that provide enterprise-wide automation. We have three functionally distinct core bank processing systems and more than 140 fully integrated complementary solutions, including business intelligence and bank management, retail and business banking, digital and mobile internet banking and electronic payment solutions, risk management and protection, and item and document imaging solutions. Our banking solutions have state-of-the-art functional capabilities, and we can re-market the hardware required by on-premise use of each software system. Our banking solutions can be delivered on-premise or through our private cloud delivery model and are backed by a company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service. Jack Henry Banking is a recognized market leader, currently supporting nearly 1,000 banks with its technology platforms.
•Symitar supports credit unions of all sizes with an information and transaction processing platform that provides enterprise-wide automation. Our solution includes one flagship core processing system and more than 100 fully integrated complementary solutions, including business intelligence and credit union management, member and member business services, digital and mobile internet banking and electronic payment solutions, risk management and protection, and item and document imaging solutions. Our credit union solution also has state-of-the-art functional capabilities. We also re-market the hardware required by on-premise use of the software system. Our credit union solution can be delivered on-premise or through our private cloud delivery model, and is backed by our company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service. Symitar currently supports over 700 credit union customers.
•ProfitStars is a leading provider of specialized products and services assembled primarily through our focused diversification acquisition strategy. These core agnostic solutions are compatible with a wide variety of information technology platforms and operating environments and offer more than 100 fully-integrated complementary solutions, including proven solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security and mitigating operational risks, and/or controlling operating costs. ProfitStars’ products and services enhance the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and diverse corporate entities. Profitstars has over 8,300 customers, including nearly 6,700 non-core customers. These distinct products and services can be implemented individually or as solution suites to address specific business problems or needs and enable effective responses to dynamic industry trends.
We strive to develop and maintain functionally robust, integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels, regularly updating and improving those solutions using an interactive customer enhancement process; ensuring compliance with relevant regulations; updated with proven advances in technology; and consistent with JKHY’s reputation as a premium product and service provider.
Core Software Systems
Core software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and to maintain centralized customer/member information.
Jack Henry Banking markets three core software systems to banks and Symitar markets one core software system to credit unions. These core systems are available for on-premise installation at customer sites, or financial institutions can choose to leverage our private cloud environment for ongoing information processing.
Jack Henry Banking’s three core banking platforms are: 
•SilverLake®, a robust system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks with assets ranging from $500 million to $50 billion. Some progressive smaller banks and de novo (start-up) banks also select SilverLake. This system is in use by over 400 banks, and now automates over 8% of the domestic banks with assets less than $50 billion.
•CIF 20/20®, a parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports approximately 360 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of $3 billion.
•Core Director®, a cost-efficient system with point-and-click operation that now supports nearly 200 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of $2 billion.
Symitar’s core credit union platform is: 
•Episys®, a robust system designed specifically for credit unions. It has been implemented by over 700 credit unions with assets ranging from $3 million to $25 billion, and according to National Credit Union Administration data, is the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other alternative core system.
Customers electing to install our solutions on-premise license the proprietary software systems. The majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We re-market the hardware and peripheral equipment that is required by on-premise use of our software solutions; and we perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. On-premise customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location.
Customers can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by on-premise installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by leveraging our private cloud environment for those functions. Our core private cloud services are provided through a highly resilient data center configuration across multiple physical locations. We also provide image item processing services from two host/archive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country. We print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three regional printing and rendering centers. Customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for seven or more years that include "per account" fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period.
We support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system, the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products, the ongoing integration of practical new technologies, and regulatory compliance initiatives. JKHY also serves each core customer as a single point of contact, support, and accountability.
Complementary Products and Services 
We have more than 140 complementary products and services that are targeted to our core banks and more than 100 targeted to credit union customers. Many of these are selectively sold by our ProfitStars division to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems.
These complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customer/member demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase operating efficiency, address specific operational issues, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions sold by ProfitStars enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security and mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs.
JKHY regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients, and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and/or containing costs. The Company’s Industry Research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need, evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, 
and manages the introduction of new product offerings. JKHY’s new complementary products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances.
Implementation and Training
Most of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products.
A complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities or work remotely with clients to help manage the implementation process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the JKHY system. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed.
We also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers. We have a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education. The curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of JKHY’s core and complementary products, to optimize ongoing system enhancements, and to fully understand dynamic year-end legislative and regulatory requirements. Each basic, intermediate, and advanced course is delivered by system experts, supported by professional materials and training tools, and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach. The program supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels, including classroom-based courses offered in JKHY’s regional training centers, Internet-based live instruction, eLearning courses, on-site training, and train-the-trainer programs.
Support and Services
We serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide. Our comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates:
•Exacting service standards;
•Trained support staff available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year;
•Assigned account managers;
•Sophisticated support tools, resources, and technology;
•Broad experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from every competitive platform; 
•Highly effective change management and control processes; and
•A best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience supporting nearly 8,400 diverse clients.
Most on-premise customers contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for JKHY. These support services are typically priced at approximately 20% of the respective product’s software license fee. The subsequent years' service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees are typically billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with pro-ration for new product implementations that occur during the fiscal year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or JKHY gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration.
High levels of support are provided to our private cloud customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for on-premise customers. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly private cloud fees.
JKHY regularly measures customer satisfaction using formal annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests. We believe this process confirms that we consistently exceed our customers’ service-related expectations.
Hardware Systems
Our software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation, and many other hardware providers that allow JKHY to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers. We currently sell IBM Power Systems™; Lenovo, Dell, and HP servers and workstations; Canon, Digital Check, Epson, and Panini check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions.
Digital Products and Services
Jack Henry Digital represents a category of digital products and services that are being built and integrated together into one unified platform. Our main offering is the Banno Digital Platform. It is an online and mobile banking platform that helps community financial institutions strategically differentiate their digital offerings from those of megabanks and other financial technology companies. It is a complete, open digital banking platform that gives community financial institutions attractive, fast, native applications for their customers and members and cloud-based, core-connected back office tools for their employees. 
Electronic Payment Solutions
Electronic payment solutions provide our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovation with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing, attract profitable retail and commercial accounts, increase operating efficiencies, comply with regulatory mandates, and proactively mitigate and manage payment-related risk.
Jack Henry identifies four components of Electronic Payment Solutions:
•Card Services provides a comprehensive suite of Automated Teller Machine ("ATM"), debit/credit card transaction processing and fraud management solutions. The card processing solutions include loyalty/rewards, fraud detection, cardholder alert and controls, and other key components that are fully integrated with JKHY's core and complementary solutions.
•Bill Pay and Mobile banking platforms are offered through our iPay and Banno product offerings. iPay offers iPay Business Bill Pay™, a full suite of online financial management solutions designed to meet the distinct needs of small businesses, as well as iPay Consumer Bill Pay™, a solution that supports single or recurring payments, allows customers to receive full bills electronically, and easily integrates with any internet banking provider. Banno Mobile™ offers a native mobile banking application for both iOS and Android that offers innovative and cost-effective mobile services that can be marketed with customer's own brand identity. It allows customers to aggregate all of their account balances and transactional data from multiple financial institutions and empowers them with the convenience of anytime, anywhere account access.
•Faster Payments includes the development of JHA PayCenter, a payments hub that provides streamlined, secure payment capabilities for sending and receiving transactions instantly 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through JKHY’s core and complementary solutions with direct connections to both Zelle and Real Time Payments ("RTP") real-time networks with plans to accommodate the Federal Reserve's network in 2023.
•Processing/Other includes Enterprise Payment Solutions ("EPS"), a comprehensive payments engine and one of the leading total payments solutions on the market today. EPS offers an integrated suite of remote deposit capture, ACH and card transaction processing solutions, risk management tools, reporting capabilities, and more for financial institutions of all sizes. EPS helps financial institutions succeed in today’s competitive market to increase revenue, improve efficiencies, better manage compliance, and enhance customer relationships. Furthermore, Commercial Lending Solutions help financial institutions securely transition from a traditional lending portfolio (focused on real estate-based consumer lending) to a more fully diversified portfolio developed via commercial and industrial lending. Our solutions also provide reliable ways to retain creditworthy business customers facing financial hurdles, while mitigating the risk of loan loss.
Research and Development
We invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance. Our core and complementary systems are enhanced a minimum of once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely customer-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing customer contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs.
Research and development expenses for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $109.0 million, $110.0 million, and $96.4 million, respectively. We recorded capitalized software in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 of $128.3 million, $117.3 million, and $111.1 million, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
JKHY serves established, well defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sales opportunities.
The marketing and sales initiatives within the Jack Henry Banking and Symitar business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. 
ProfitStars sells specialized core agnostic niche solutions that complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters.
Dedicated sales forces support each of JKHY’s three primary marketed brands. Sales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Brand-specific sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. Our marketing department supports all of our brands with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; telemarketing; customer newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. JKHY also hosts annual national education conferences which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services.
JKHY has sold select products and services primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean and Canada. International sales accounted for less than 1% of JKHY’s total revenue in the fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Competition
The market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of JKHY’s current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility and ease-of-use, customer support, and existing customer references. For more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions, and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future.
Jack Henry Banking and Symitar compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.; Fiserv, Inc.; and Finastra. ProfitStars competes with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities.
Intellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks 
Although we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights, our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology. We have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks. Most of our technology is not patented. Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, resellers, customers, and potential customers. Access to and distribution of our Company’s source code is restricted, and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain, or use our products or technology. We cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.
Regulatory Compliance
JKHY maintains a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given. JKHY’s compliance program is coordinated by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience, and a thorough working knowledge of JKHY and our solutions. These compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements, including regular discussions on emerging topics with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations.
JKHY has a process to inform internal stakeholders of new and revised regulatory requirements. Upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the Company’s development teams through monthly regulatory compliance meetings and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle. JKHY publishes newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations. Periodically, customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes.
Internal audits of our systems, networks, operations, business recovery plans, and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems, processes, 
plans and security. The FFIEC conducts annual reviews throughout the Company and issues a Report of Examination. The Board of Directors provides oversight of these activities through the Risk and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee.
Government Regulation
The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. All financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision. Our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers, including but not limited to those mandated by federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information regulations, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The compliance of JKHY’s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors, including the parameters set through the interactive design, the classification of customers, and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services. Our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we provide solutions that assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services. We cannot predict the impact these regulations, any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future.
JKHY is not chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions. However, operating as a service provider to financial institutions, JKHY’s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions, and subject to periodic reviews by FFIEC regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews.
JKHY provides private cloud services through JHA OutLink Processing Services™ data Centers, electronic transaction processing through JHA Card Processing Solutions™, internet banking through NetTeller® and Banno online solutions, bill payment through iPay, network security monitoring and Hosted Network Solutions ("HNS") through our Gladiator® unit, cloud services through Hosted Partner Services and Enterprise Integration Services, and business recovery services through Centurion Disaster Recovery®.
The private cloud services provided by JKHY are subject to examination by FFIEC regulators under the Bank Service Company Act. These examinations cover a wide variety of subjects, including system development, functionality, reliability, and security, as well as disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. Our private cloud services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities on occasion.
Information Security
We are committed to the protection and security of the sensitive information contained on our systems and accessed through our products and services. Because threats to information security pose risks to our business and to our customers, we proactively make strategic investments in security and the infrastructure and procedural controls for our systems. These investments enable a comprehensive set of security controls that are maintained and tested on a consistent basis. Additional third-party reviews are performed throughout the organization, such as Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standard assessments, state and federal regulatory examinations, intrusion tests, and System and Organizations Controls ("SOC") 1 or SOC 2 reports. The Board of Directors provides oversight of these activities through the Risk and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee.

As of June 30, 2021, we had 6,714 full-time employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there have been no labor-related work stoppages. 
Talent Attraction and Engagement
Our people and culture strategy focuses on attracting, engaging, and retaining qualified, diverse, and innovative talent at all levels of the Company. We are a committed equal opportunity employer and all qualified candidates receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, genetic information, or other characteristics protected by applicable law.
Beyond nondiscrimination compliance, we are committed to fostering a respectful, diverse, and inclusive workplace in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. In 2020, our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Foss, signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge, joining nearly 2,000 other chief executives and presidents who have made a pledge to act on supporting a more inclusive workplace for employees, communities, and society at large.
We actively engage our Business Innovation Groups (“BIGs”) to develop attraction and retention practices that exemplify and advance a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture. Our BIGs are company-sponsored and employee-driven groups open to all employees. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,600 unique associates participating in six active BIGs, with five focused on inclusion for specific communities—women, people of color, remote associates, LGBTQ+, and veterans— and one focused on environmental and sustainability topics. While BIGs allow associates to connect and support each other, they also function to address bona fide business problems. For example, these groups work with executive leadership to actively improve our talent attraction processes for prospective employees. They also provide education, training, and conversation opportunities to all employees to advance diversity, inclusion, understanding, and innovation throughout the Company. 
We seek to actively listen to our employees throughout the year using a defined listening strategy designed to gather regular feedback on well-being, engagement, leadership, culture and values, and other top of mind topics. These surveys allow us to respond to employee concerns, benefit from employee perspectives, and better design and develop processes to support our Company culture. Employees can learn about changes through our quarterly employee update videos or all-employee town hall meetings delivered by senior management. Based on periodic monitoring, we believe our voluntary attrition rate is low compared to competitive benchmarks. We believe our strong retention rate demonstrates healthy engagement by our employees. 
Training and Development
Our success depends not only on attracting and retaining talented employees, but also in developing our current employees and providing new opportunities for their growth. We offer our employees numerous live and on-demand training programs and resources to help them build knowledge and improve skills. These trainings include mandatory programs, such as security awareness, as well as recommended but optional programs, such as a recent training on mitigating unconscious bias that received a high level of participation and led many of our employees to take a personal pledge to support inclusion in the workplace. Self-developer weeks specifically allow employees the opportunity to sign-up for curated courses covering topics such as technology trends and JKHY products and services. Through our BIGs, we also offer opportunities for employees to advance their knowledge of diversity, equity, and inclusion matters. 
Recognizing the importance of mentoring in career development, we host an internal mentorship marketplace, which allows prospective mentors and mentees to connect and self-initiate a mentoring relationship. We also provide an internal mobility marketplace, which offers career coaching and tools for employees to create personalized development plans and build peer connections. In fiscal 2020, we launched a targeted, four-week leadership development initiative for over 100 women at JKHY to address barriers to advancing in leadership roles they commonly encounter.
We recognize and value the contribution of our employees who develop, improve, and support our technology solutions and we provide additional development opportunities for them to advance their technical expertise. This includes access to on-demand technical training libraries, certification programs, and classes facilitated by external experts.
Wellness and Safety
JKHY emphasizes the safety and well-being of our employees as a top priority. We define wellness comprehensively and include mental, physical, emotional, financial, psychological, and environmental considerations. JKHY offers a competitive compensation and benefits package and supports dedicated campaigns that communicate directly to employees about financial wellness, mental health, healthful nutrition and exercise, and other wellness topics. Employee well-being is further supported through policies such as paid parental leave, military service leave, educational assistance, and bereavement leave policies. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we made impactful changes to our benefits program, including waiving all out-of-pocket expenses associated with COVID-19 for employees or dependents covered under Jack Henry’s medical plans. We also shifted to a predominantly remote workforce to ensure the continued safety of our employees, clients, and communities. For more information on our COVID-19 response, see “COVID-19 Impact and Response” above.
