Aerospace and Defense 
Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized technology-based engineering and manufacturing company that develops and produces specialized power and propulsion systems, as well as armament systems. We develop and manufacture liquid and solid rocket propulsion, air-breathing hypersonic engines, and electric power and propulsion for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Principal customers and end users include the DoD (including the U.S. Air Force ("USAF"), U.S. Army, Missile Defense Agency ("MDA"), and U.S. Navy), NASA, The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin"), Raytheon Company ("Raytheon"), and United Launch Alliance ("ULA"). 
We have demonstrated a legacy of successfully meeting the most challenging missions by producing some of the world’s most technologically advanced propulsion systems to meet our nation's critical needs. We believe we maintain a unique competitive position due to our strategic focus on creating and maintaining a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for our innovative energy management technologies. The highly reliable nature of our revenue comes from the long-term nature of the programs with which we are involved, our attractive contract base and our deep customer relationships. High renewal rates, supported by our market leading technology provide us with a highly stable business base from which to grow. As of December 31, 2019, our remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $5.4 billion and our funded backlog, which includes only amounts for which funding has been authorized by a customer and a purchase order has been received, totaled $2.1 billion. 
Primary Markets and Programs 
The markets and key programs we serve are: 
Aerospace. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion and power systems for space applications. Our products include a broad market offering of both electric and chemical propulsion (liquid propellant engines and solid rocket motors) required for launch vehicle and in-space applications supporting defense, civil and commercial missions.
Our space products have a long, successful flight heritage with the U.S. government and we continue to provide strong support of National Security Space requirements enabling communications, navigation, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. We provide first stage and upper stage liquid propulsion for ULA’s Delta IV launch vehicle as well as the liquid upper stage propulsion for the Atlas V launch vehicle in support of the National Security Space Launch ("NSSL") program. In the commercial market, we provide space propulsion products to all major U.S. commercial satellite manufacturers. 
We continue to support the exploration of deep space. During 2019, NASA committed to returning the U.S. to the Moon by 2024 with the Artemis program and we are a critical contributor to multiple elements of this historic endeavor. This year, we completed acceptance testing of all sixteen RS-25 engines and flight controllers needed to support the first four flights of NASA’s Space Launch System ("SLS") and completed core stage integration of the first set of these engines for Artemis I, the first launch of SLS. Also in support of Artemis I, we delivered the jettison motor for Orion’s Launch Abort System and qualified the motor for all future Artemis missions. Hardware deliveries for Artemis II have also begun, including auxiliary engines for integration into Orion’s European Service Module. In addition, Lockheed Martin awarded us a contract to support production of NASA’s Orion spacecraft fleet for Artemis missions three through five with an option to support missions six through eight. Finally, our Advanced Electric Propulsion System thruster for the Power and Propulsion Element of NASA’s Gateway demonstrated operation at full power for the first time; achieving an important program milestone for NASA’s orbiting lunar outpost for robotic and human exploration.
In support of Low Earth Orbit human spaceflight initiatives, astronauts installed new sets of our Lithium-Ion batteries into the International Space Station’s ("ISS") power system in 2019. These batteries will provide twice the kilowatt-hours than their predecessors at a fraction of the mass, and are expected to operate for at least ten years. In addition, we have a major role in Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft for NASA, which will usher in a new era of commercial human spaceflight by ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS for NASA. The Starliner Orbital Flight Test ("OFT") demonstration mission launched on December 20, 2019, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida; NASA and Boeing are currently reviewing the test results.
Our propulsion hardware supported all phases of the OFT mission, from launch on ULA's Atlas V launch vehicle with two RL10 engines powering the upper stage for orbital maneuvering to atmospheric re-entry with our thrusters. Prior to OFT, Boeing conducted a successful Starliner Pad Abort Test, during which the service module demonstrated its ability to separate itself from a simulated launch vehicle and propel itself and the crew module approximately one mile high and one mile downrange, and then separate from the crew module in a controlled manner using our propulsion. 
We continued to mature critical technologies for our nation’s next generation of advanced hydrocarbon engines for future high-performance launch systems. In February 2016, the USAF awarded Aerojet Rocketdyne a Rocket Propulsion System Other Transaction Agreement ("OTA"), a public-private partnership, to develop the AR1 engine. Following the decision by the Launch Services Program competitors not to incorporate the AR1 in their new launch vehicle designs, we signed a modification to the existing OTA to design, build, and assemble only one AR1 engine. 
Also in 2019, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Firefly Aerospace, Inc. ("Firefly") announced a cooperative agreement that combines the capabilities of both companies to provide flexible, sustainable and highly competitive space access solutions. This partnership with Firefly creates an opportunity to expand our customer base and represents a new paradigm for engagement with other emerging entrants as well.
In addition, along with NASA, Ball Aerospace and the Air Force Research Laboratory ("AFRL"), we supported the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, which is conducting a thirteen-month demonstration of a "green" propellant developed by the AFRL. The revolutionary mission is examining if this new propellant can improve overall efficiency while reducing the handling concerns associated with traditional spacecraft propellants.
A subset of our key space programs include: (i) RL10 and RS-68 engines/boosters that power the NSSL, (ii) RS-25 main engine for NASA’s SLS for deep space exploration, propulsion for the Orion human space capsule and the Starliner Commercial Crew Transportation Capability capsule, (iii) power systems for ISS and (iv) multiple in-space electric and chemical propulsion systems to provide orbit raising and satellite station positioning.
Defense. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense applications including both solid and liquid propellant based systems, along with air-breathing (ramjet) systems for missile applications. The majority of these systems are the primary axial propulsion for missile systems. The breadth of our products includes tactical missiles, missile defense boosters and large solid-propellant boosters for a variety of applications. 
We also develop and manufacture liquid and solid divert and attitude control ("DACs") propulsion systems for missile defense applications. These are complex systems that provide multi-directional thrust and variable thrust levels to steer or control an intercept missile. Additionally, we develop and manufacture post-boost propulsion systems for strategic missiles. These systems provide directional control for critical missile defense interceptors and for ground and sea-based strategic missiles.
We also design, develop, and produce warhead/lethality systems for tactical missiles. Our tactical armament products have been successfully fielded on multiple active U.S. and international weapon system platforms.
During 2019, we continued to expand our strong legacy propulsion franchises on the Standard Missile, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 ("PAC-3"), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ("THAAD") and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ("GMLRS") missile programs. These franchise programs continue to be globally deployed in support of U.S. and allied armed forces.
As part of our continuing Competitive Improvement Program, we built on the previous transition of the energetic production of the Standard Missile-3 DACs and THAAD Boost Motor from our Sacramento, California facility to our Orange County, Virginia, and Camden, Arkansas, facilities. In 2019, we initiated recurring production activity at our new Advanced Manufacturing Facility in Huntsville, Alabama. This facility is now producing high-value non-energetic sub-assemblies for Standard Missile and THAAD.
In the hypersonic propulsion technology area, we added another competitively selected award for the Axial Upper Stage ("AUS") component technologies program from the MDA, in addition to last year's selection for the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon ("HCSW") with Lockheed Martin and Operational Fires ("OpFires") with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA"). Significant development activity on all three programs occurred during 2019. Our work on complementary air-breathing propulsion (ramjet/scramjet) for hypersonic missiles continued in 2019 with completion of flight-ready engines.
In 2019, we were selected by Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop") as their propulsion supplier for a large solid-propellant stage and the post-boost propulsion system of their Ground Based Strategic Deterrent ("GBSD") offering to the USAF. Northrop submitted the only offer for the USAF GBSD program, and the award is expected during the second half of 2020. The GBSD solid stage win continues our presence in the large solid rocket motor market segment. 
Finally, in 2019, our Aerojet Rocketdyne Coleman Aerospace ("Coleman") business successfully completed the first mission of the C-17 aircraft deployed medium-range ballistic missile ("MRBM") target. Coleman also continued to expand its scope on the MRBM missile target program with the development of new subsystems that will allow target simulation of significantly more advanced threats.
A subset of our key defense programs include: Boosters and Solid DACs for the Navy’s Standard Missile family, Booster and Liquid DACs for THAAD, PAC-3, GMLRS, Stinger, Javelin, Tactical Tomahawk, Army Tactical Missile Systems ("ATACMS"), Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided ("TOW") warhead, and HAWK.
Information concerning the percentage of net sales attributable to our significant programs appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Competition 
The competitive dynamics of our business vary by product type and customer, but we experience many of the same challenges as the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely difficult or hazardous to build, which require rigorous manufacturing systems and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (such as additive manufacturing) are enabling new entrants with the funding to enter this industry, leading to increased competition. To date, competition from new entrants has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, new entrants such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have developed liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for space launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion products that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new competitors have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are willing to take on substantial risk exposure on development programs with unproven market potential and are, therefore, disrupting existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies. For the in-space propulsion market, we also see a number of new startups entering the market in both small chemical propulsion and small electric propulsion systems targeted at the rapidly expanding small satellite market.
The following table lists the primary participants in the propulsion market (in alphabetical order): 
Company | Parent | Propulsion Type 
Aerojet Rocketdyne | Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. | Solid, liquid, air-breathing, electric
Airbus Defence and Space | Airbus | Solid, liquid, electric 
Avio | Avio S.p.A | Solid, liquid 
Busek | Busek Co. Inc. | Electric 
Blue Origin LLC | Blue Origin | Liquid 
Electron Technologies, Inc. | L-3 Communications Corporation | Electric 
General Dynamics OTS | General Dynamics | Solid 
Moog Inc. | Moog Inc. | Liquid 
Nammo Talley | Nammo Talley | Solid, liquid

Industry Overview 
Our primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We rely on U.S. government spending on aerospace and defense products and systems and our backlog depends, in large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These funding levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of funding. Moreover, although our contracts will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. Congress must appropriate funds for a given program and the U.S. President must sign into law such appropriations legislation each government fiscal year ("GFY") that may significantly increase, decrease or eliminate, funding for a program. A decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
In December of 2019, the U.S. President signed Public Law 116-93, which included full-year appropriations bills for GFY 2020 for the DoD and NASA, and all other government agencies. The bill includes topline funding of $695.6 billion for defense spending, an increase of $20.7 billion above GFY 2019. The NASA portion of the bill includes topline funding of $22.6 billion, $1.1 billion above GFY 2019.
Major Customers 
Information concerning major customers appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Contract Types 
Research and development ("R&D") contracts are awarded during the early stages of a program’s development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature products for operational use. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s contracts are largely categorized as either "fixed-price" (largely used by the U.S. government for production-type contracts) or "cost-reimbursable" (largely used by the U.S. government for development-type contracts). During 2019, approximately 61% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts and 39% from cost-reimbursable contracts. 
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) firm fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price level of effort contracts. For firm fixed-price contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs during contract performance. For fixed-price-incentive fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives increased or decreased fees (or profits) based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the customer’s labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in lower than expected contract profit margin and losses. 
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne typically receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared with contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule. 
In addition, OTA contracts are becoming more prevalent in the developmental stages of U.S. government procurements. An OTA is a special vehicle used by federal agencies for obtaining or advancing R&D or prototypes. The U.S. government's procurement regulations and certain procurement statutes do not apply to OTAs, and accordingly, other transaction authority gives agencies the flexibility necessary to develop agreements tailored to a particular transaction. Generally, our sales and backlog figures do not include work we have under contracts obligated by the customer under an OTA as our share of the contract costs are recognized as company-funded R&D. 
Government Contracts and Regulations 
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), agency-specific regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to U.S. government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustments, mandatory disclosure, and audit requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines that could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to routine audits, reviews, and investigations by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), the Defense Contract Management Agency, and other similar U.S. government agencies. Such reviews include but are not limited to our contract performance, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards as well as the review of the adequacy of our accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting systems. 
The U.S. government’s ability to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would 
be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination. 
Additional information about the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Backlog 
Information concerning backlog appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Backlog." 
Seasonality 
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business is not subject to predictable seasonality. Primary factors affecting the timing of our sales include the timing of U.S. government awards, the availability of U.S. government funding, contractual product delivery requirements, and customer acceptances. 
Research and Development
We view R&D efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we compete. Our R&D is primarily supported by customer funding. Our company-funded R&D efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes. See Note 1(s) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on R&D expenditures.
Suppliers and Raw Materials 
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances beyond our control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to our program performance and cost. 
 Availability of raw materials and supplies has been generally sufficient. We sometimes are dependent, for a variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and have, in some instances in the past, experienced difficulties meeting production and delivery obligations because of delays in delivery or reliance on such suppliers. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often limited to procuring materials from certain suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. 
Additional information about the risks relating to suppliers and raw materials appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Intellectual Property 
Where appropriate, Aerojet Rocketdyne obtains patents in the U.S. and other countries for new and useful processes, machines, manufactures or compositions of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof relating to its products and services. Our patents are maintained through the statutory limit of time, which is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application, where the claimed invention has value in the markets in which we compete. We rely on trade secret protection for financial, technical and personnel information that provides an economic competitive advantage by virtue of not being known by the relevant public and ordinarily require employees to sign confidentiality agreements as a condition to employment. If properly protected, trade secrets can be maintained in perpetuity. Aerojet Rocketdyne takes reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of its trade secrets in order to maintain protection under applicable state and federal laws. As our products and services typically embody complex systems that include many technologies, we do not believe any single existing patent, license, or trade secret is material to our success.
Real Estate 
We own 11,394 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento ("Sacramento Land"). Acquired in the early 1950s and historically used for our aerospace and defense operations, large portions were used solely to provide safe buffer zones around hazardous operations. Modern changes in propulsion technology coupled with the relocation of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to re-entitle the Sacramento Land for new uses and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.
The Sacramento Land is made up of 5,203 acres previously used for our aerospace and defense operations, 628 acres available for future entitlement, and 5,563 acres for future development under the brand name "Easton". Easton has 3,904 acres that are fully entitled. The term "entitlement" is generally used to denote the required set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for new requested uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each jurisdiction and each zoning proposal and may include permits, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others prior to construction. 
As Easton continues to execute re-entitlement and pre-development activities, we are pursuing all monetization options and are exploring how to maximize value from Easton. Value creation and monetization may include outright land sales and/or joint ventures with real estate developers, residential builders, and/or other third parties. We believe the long-term prospect for 
5

the Sacramento region represents an attractive and affordable alternative to the San Francisco Bay Area and other large metropolitan areas of California. 
The following table summarizes the Sacramento Land (in acres): 

 | EnvironmentallyUnrestricted | EnvironmentallyRestricted (1) | | Total | Entitled
Glenborough and Easton Place | 1,043 | | 349 | | 1,392 | 1,392
Rio del Oro | 1,818 | | 491 | | 2,309 | 2,309
Westborough | 1,387 | | 272 | | 1,659 | —

Office Park and Auto Mall | 47 | | 8 | | 55 | 55 
Total Easton acreage | 4,346 | | 1,217 | | 5,563 | 3,904
Former operations land (3) | 24 | | 5,179 | | 5,203 | 
Land available for future entitlement (4) | 386 | | 242 | | 628 | 
Total Sacramento Land | 4,756 | | 6,638 | | 11,394 | 

_________

(1) | Indicates land subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 9(b) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land.

(2) The remaining 148 acres designated in Hillsborough will be transferred, per the completed purchase and sale contract from 2015, when the required environmental remediation work is completed. 

(3) | In 2019, we completed our manufacturing commitments in our Sacramento, California facility and transitioned the Sacramento site to host our shared services function. See additional information in Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.


(4) | We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time.

Leasing 
We currently lease office space in Sacramento to various third parties that generated $7.5 million in revenue in 2019. 
Environmental Matters 
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations, and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Under existing U.S. environmental laws, Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"), are jointly and severally liable, and therefore we are potentially liable to the U.S. government or other third parties for the full cost of remediating the contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agencies. The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities requires significant management judgment to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future costs that may be required for remediation measures. Further, environmental standards change from time to time. However, we perform quarterly reviews of these matters and accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability, usually based on proportionate sharing, can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities have not been discounted to their present value as the amounts and timing of cash payments are not fixed or reliably determinable. 
On January 12, 1999, we reached a settlement agreement ("Global Settlement") with the U.S. government covering environmental costs associated with our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site. Pursuant to the Global Settlement, we can recover up to 88% of our environmental remediation costs through the establishment of prices for Aerojet Rocketdyne's products and services sold to the U.S. government. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the Electronics and Information Systems business in 2001, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into an agreement with Northrop (the "Northrop Agreement") whereby Aerojet Rocketdyne is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to an annual billing limitation of $6.0 million and a cumulative limitation of $189.7 million. 
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowed to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government. 
The inclusion of environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government impacts our competitive pricing; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.
We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2019 nor do we anticipate any material capital expenditures in 2020 and 2021. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part II, Item 7 "Environmental Matters" of this Report for additional information. 
Additional information on the risks related to environmental matters can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report, including the material effects on compliance with environmental regulations that may impact our competitive position and operating results. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2019, 9% of our 4,814 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and unions are good.
