ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Compass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust (“Holdings”, or the “Trust”), was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company (the “Company”), was also formed on November 18, 2005. The Trust and the Company (collectively, “CODI”) were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. The Trust is the sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests, as defined in our LLC Agreement, of the Company. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Trust owns an identical number of Trust Interests in the Company as exist for the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Accordingly, our shareholders are treated as beneficial owners of Trust Interests in the Company and, as such, are currently subject to tax under partnership income tax provisions.
The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors whose corporate governance responsibilities are similar to that of a Delaware corporation. The Company’s board of directors oversees the management of the Company and our businesses and the performance of Compass Group Management LLC (“CGM” or our “Manager”). Certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation as beneficial owners of 45.0% through Sostratus LLC of the Allocation Interests in us, as defined in our LLC Agreement.
Overview
We acquire controlling interests in and actively manage businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, (ii) have positive and stable cash flows, (iii) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence, and (iv) have strong management teams largely in place.
Our unique public structure provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of companies which have historically been owned by private equity firms, wealthy individuals or families. We offer investors a unique opportunity to own a diverse group of leading middle-market businesses in the branded-industrial and niche-consumer sectors. 
Our disciplined approach to our target markets provides opportunities to methodically purchase attractive businesses at values that are accretive to our shareholders. For sellers of businesses, our unique financial structure allows us to acquire businesses efficiently with little or no third party financing contingencies and, following acquisition, to provide our businesses with substantial access to growth capital. In addition, our model and ample liquidity allows us to acquire businesses at any point across economic cycles, ensuring that we are able to act quickly when the opportunity presents itself to do so and that we’re not paralyzed when markets are volatile. 
We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their business units may consider us an attractive purchaser because of our ability to:
•provide ongoing strategic and financial support for their businesses, including professionalization of our subsidiaries at scale;
•maintain a long-term outlook as to the ownership of those businesses where such an outlook is required for maximization of our shareholders’ return on investment; and
•consummate transactions efficiently without being dependent on third-party transaction financing.
In particular, we believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many private company operators and parent companies may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook reduces both the risk that businesses may be sold at unfavorable points in the overall market cycle and enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses. Traditional private equity managers are often pressured to transact in markets characterized by rich valuations, abundant credit and fund life-related pressures. With no pre-defined investment periods to drive our strategy, we can remain patient and disciplined in our conservative, low leverage approach to capital deployment and avoid the “moral hazard” faced by other private equity managers.
Finally, it has been our experience, that our ability to acquire businesses without the cumbersome delays and conditions typical of third party transactional financing is appealing to sellers of businesses who are interested in confidentiality, speed and certainty to close.
We believe our management team’s strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us substantial opportunities to assess small to middle market businesses available for acquisition. In addition, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.
In terms of the businesses in which we have a controlling interest as of December 31, 2020, we believe that these businesses have strong management teams, operate in strong markets with defensible market niches and environmental, social and governance ("ESG") tailwinds, and maintain long-standing customer relationships. 
We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups (i) branded consumer businesses and, (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product categories. Niche industrial businesses are those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sectors.

Our Manager
Our Manager, CGM, has been engaged to manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and to execute our strategy, as discussed below. Collectively, our management team has extensive experience in acquiring 
and managing small and middle market businesses. We believe our Manager is unique in the marketplace in terms of the success and experience of its employees in acquiring and managing diverse businesses of the size and general nature of our businesses. We believe this experience will provide us with an advantage in executing our overall strategy. Our management team devotes substantially all of its time to the affairs of the Company.
We have entered into a management services agreement, (the “Management Services Agreement” or “MSA”) pursuant to which our Manager manages the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and oversees the management and operations of our businesses. We pay our Manager a quarterly management fee for the services it performs on our behalf. In addition, certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation with respect to its Allocation Interests in us. All of the Allocation Interests in us are owned by Sostratus LLC. See Part III, Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” for further descriptions of the management fees and profit allocations.
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager and have been seconded to us. Neither the Trust nor the Company has any other employees. Although our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager, they report directly to the Company’s board of directors. The management fee paid to our Manager covers all expenses related to the services performed by our Manager, including the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other personnel providing services to us. The Company reimburses our Manager for the compensation and related costs and expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and his staff, who dedicate substantially all of their time to the affairs of the Company.
See Part III, Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.”
Market Opportunity
We acquire and actively manage small and middle market businesses. We characterize small to middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $75 million per year. We believe that the acquisition market for these businesses is highly fragmented and often provides opportunities to purchase at more attractive prices and achieve better outcomes for our shareholders. We believe this is driven by the following factors:
•third-party financing for these acquisitions is often less available or terms are less favorable for the borrower;
•sellers of these businesses frequently consider non-economic factors, such as legacy or the effect of the sale on their employees;
•these businesses are more likely to be sold outside of an auction process or as part of a limited process; and
•"add-on" acquisitions can often be completed at attractive multiples of cash flow.
Frequently, opportunities exist to support and augment existing management at such businesses and improve the performance of these businesses upon their acquisition through active management. We are business builders rather than asset traders. In the past, our management team has acquired businesses that were owned by entrepreneurs or large corporate parents. In these cases, our management team has frequently found opportunities to profitably invest in areas of the acquired businesses beyond levels that existed at the time of acquisition. In addition, our management team has frequently found that processes such as financial reporting and management information systems of acquired businesses may be improved, leading to improvements in reporting and operations and ultimately earnings and cash flow. Finally, our management team often acts as a business development arm for our businesses to pursue organic or external growth strategies that may not have been pursued by their previous owners.
Our Strategy 
CODI’s permanent capital structure enables us to invest in people, processes, culture, and growth opportunities that drive transformational change. We have two primary strategies that we use to support long-term value creation. First, we focus on growing the earnings and cash flow from our acquired businesses and help them professionalize at scale. We believe that the scale and scope of our businesses give us a diverse base of cash flow upon which to further build. Second, we identify, perform due diligence on, negotiate and consummate additional platform acquisitions of small to middle market businesses in attractive industry sectors in accordance with acquisition criteria established by the board of directors.
Management Strategy
Our management strategy involves the proactive financial and operational management of the businesses we own in order to increase cash flows and shareholder value. Our Manager oversees and supports the management teams of each of our businesses by, among other things:
•recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses using structured incentive compensation programs, including non-controlling equity ownership, tailored to each business;
•regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals;
•identifying and aligning with external policy and performance tailwinds such as those influenced by growing climate, health, and social justice concerns (and similar environmental, social and governance ("ESG") drivers);
•assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies;
•identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities;
•assisting management in controlling and right-sizing overhead costs;
•nurturing an internal culture of transparency, alignment, accountability and governance, including regular reporting; 
•professionalizing our subsidiaries at scale; and
•forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.
Specifically, while our businesses have different growth opportunities and potential rates of growth, we expect our Manager to work with the management teams of each of our businesses to increase the value of, and cash generated by, each business through various initiatives, including:
•making selective capital investments to expand geographic reach, increase capacity, or reduce manufacturing costs of our businesses;
•investing in product research and development for new products, processes or services for customers;
•improving and expanding existing sales and marketing programs;
•pursuing reductions in operating costs through improved operational efficiency or outsourcing of certain processes and products; and
•consolidating or improving management of certain overhead functions.
Our businesses typically acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We believe that complementary add-on acquisitions improve our overall financial and operational performance by allowing us to:
•leverage manufacturing and distribution operations;
•leverage branding and marketing programs, as well as customer relationships;
•add experienced management or management expertise;
•increase market share and penetrate new markets; and
•realize cost synergies by allocating the corporate overhead expenses of our businesses across a larger number of businesses and by implementing and coordinating improved management practices.
Acquisition Strategy
Our acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that we expect to produce stable and growing earnings and cash flow. In this respect, we expect to make platform acquisitions in industries other than those in which our businesses currently operate if we believe an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity. We believe that attractive opportunities will continue to present themselves, as private sector owners seek to monetize their interests in long-standing and privately-held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their “non-core” operations.
Our ideal acquisition candidate has the following characteristics:
•is a leading branded consumer or niche industrial company headquartered in North American;
•maintains highly defensible position in the markets it serves and with customers;
•operates in an industry with favorable long-term macroeconomic trends;
•has a strong management team, either currently in place or previously identified, and meaningful incentives;
•has low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and
•maintains a diversified customer and supplier base.
We benefit from our Manager’s ability to identify potential diverse acquisition opportunities in a variety of industries. In addition, we rely upon our management team’s experience and expertise in researching and valuing prospective target businesses, as well as negotiating the ultimate acquisition of such target businesses. In particular, because there may be a lack of information available about these target businesses, which may make it more difficult to understand or appropriately value such target businesses, on our behalf, our Manager:
•engages in a substantial level of internal and third-party due diligence;
•critically evaluates the target management team;
•identifies and assesses any financial and operational strengths and weaknesses of the target business;
•analyzes comparable businesses to assess financial and operational performances relative to industry competitors;
•actively researches and evaluates information on the relevant industry; and
•thoroughly negotiates appropriate terms and conditions of any acquisition.
The process of acquiring new businesses is both time-consuming and complex. Our management team historically has taken from two to twenty-four months to perform due diligence, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although our management team is at various stages of evaluating several transactions at any given time, there may be periods of time during which our management team does not recommend any new acquisitions to us. Even if an acquisition is recommended by our management team, our board of directors may not approve it.
A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital, raised at the parent company level largely through our existing credit facility. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third-party financing, provides us with an advantage in successfully acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In addition, our strategy of providing this intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of principle on these intercompany loans.
Upon acquisition of a new business, we rely on our Manager’s experience and expertise to work efficiently and effectively with the management of the new business to jointly develop and execute a successful business plan.
In addition to acquiring businesses, we sell those businesses that we own from time to time when attractive opportunities arise that outweigh the future growth and value that we believe those businesses can attain consistent with our long-term investment strategy. As such, our decision to sell a business is based on our belief that doing so will increase shareholder value to a greater extent than through our continued ownership of that business. Upon the sale of a business, we may use the proceeds to retire debt or retain proceeds for acquisitions or general corporate purposes.
Since our inception in May 2006, we have recorded net gains on sales of our businesses of approximately $1.1 billion. We sold Crosman Acquisition Company (“Crosman”) in January 2007, Aeroglide Company (“Aeroglide”) and Silvue Technologies Group, Inc. (“Silvue”) in June 2008, Staffmark Holdings Inc. (“Staffmark”) in October 2011, HALO Branded Solutions (“HALO”) in May 2012, CamelBak Products, LLC ("CamelBak") in August 2015, American Furniture Manufacturing, Inc. ("American Furniture") in October 2015, Tridien Medical Inc. ("Tridien") in September 2016, Fresh Hemp Foods Ltd. ("Manitoba Harvest") in February 2019 and Clean Earth Holdings Inc. ("Clean Earth") in June 2019. In addition, we sold our Fox Factory Holding Corp. ("FOX") subsidiary through an initial public offering and secondary issuances from August 2013 through March 2017. 
Strategic Advantages
Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well-positioned to acquire additional businesses. Our management team has strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, our management team has a successful track record of acquiring and 
managing small-to-middle market businesses in various industries. In negotiating these acquisitions, we believe our management team has been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations.
Our management team has a large network that we estimate to be approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team’s proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. Our management team also has a well-established network of contacts, including professional managers, attorneys, accountants and other third-party consultants and advisors, who may be available to assist us in the performance of due diligence and the negotiation of acquisitions, as well as the management and operation of our acquired businesses.
Finally, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, we expect to minimize the delays and closing conditions typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage can be a powerful one, especially in a tight credit environment, and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.
Valuation and Due Diligence
When evaluating businesses or assets for acquisition, our management team performs rigorous due diligence and a financial evaluations process including an evaluation of the operations of the target business and the outlook for its industry. While valuation of a business is a subjective process, we define valuations under a variety of analyses, including:
•discounted cash flow analyses;
•evaluation of trading values of comparable companies;
•expected value matrices; and
•examination of comparable recent transactions.
One outcome of this process is a projection of the expected cash flows from the target business. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that with detailed due diligence, future cash flows will be better estimated and the prospects for operating the business in the future better evaluated. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we engage third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary.
A further critical component of the evaluation of potential target businesses is the assessment of the capability of the existing management team, including recent performance, expertise, experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we actively seek to augment, supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute our business plan for the target business. Similarly, we analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for the target business.
Environmental, Social and Governance Practices
In the last few years, companies, investors and policymakers have focused more attention on — and have made investments in — companies that are considered leaders in ESG practices. Another way to think about ESG practices is to consider them, collectively, to be long-term performance factors designed to enable real owners to oversee their investments and balance the needs of important stakeholders in doing so. That same concept is mirrored in Compass Diversified’s business model: by bringing the virtues of private-equity-style holdings to public markets — including to individual investors who would not otherwise have access — we are helping to democratize market access while preserving professional oversight protections.
It is not just by chance that our long-term, do-good-by-doing-well, real owners approach is reflected in the companies we back with our investments, which, among them, provide products and services that support: 
•medical and first responder needs; 
•education programs; 
•outdoor health and recreational pursuits; and 
•e-commerce and technology providers. 
In addition, a number of our portfolio companies have created robust recycling and responsible sourcing programs, strong human capital management and diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") programs. We believe each of these creates long-term financial sustainability as well as making our shared world a better place.
Our long-term responsible approach is also reflected in how we manage ourselves. We have been and remain committed to being a responsible partner to our subsidiaries and are proud stewards of corporate citizenship. 
Financing
We incur third party debt financing almost entirely at the Company level, which we use, in combination with our equity capital, to provide debt financing to each of our businesses and to acquire additional businesses. We believe this financing structure is beneficial to the financial and operational activities of each of our businesses by aligning our interests as both equity holders of, and lenders to, our businesses, in a manner that we believe is more efficient than each of our businesses borrowing from third-party lenders.
Debt Financing
Credit Facility
In April 2018, we entered into the 2018 Credit Facility to amend and restate the 2014 Credit Facility, originally dated as of June 6, 2014. The 2018 Credit Facility provides for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit up to a maximum aggregate amount of $600 million, and (ii) a $500 million term loan. All amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility will become due on April 18, 2023, which is the maturity date of loans advanced under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the termination date of the revolving loan commitment. The 2018 Credit Facility also permits us, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the revolving loan commitment and/or obtain additional term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $250 million subject to certain restrictions and conditions.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $193.8 million of the 2018 Term Loan in July 2019, and the remaining $298.8 million due under the 2018 Term Loan in November 2019. 
The 2018 Credit Facility provides for letters of credit under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount not to exceed $100 million outstanding at any time, as well as swing line loans of up to $25 million outstanding at one time. At no time may the (i) aggregate principal amount of all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all outstanding letters of credit and swing line loans, exceed the borrowing availability under the 2018 Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $1.3 million. The borrowing availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2020 was approximately $291.7 million.
The 2018 Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of the Company, including all of its equity interests in, and loans to, its consolidated subsidiaries. (See "Note I - Debt" to the consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding our 2018 Credit Facility).
Senior Notes
On April 18, 2018, we consummated the issuance and sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the "Senior Notes") offered pursuant to a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes to repay debt under our existing credit facilities in connection with a concurrent refinancing transaction described above. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 18, 2018 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 8.000% per annum and will mature on May 1, 2026. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable in cash on May 1st and November 1st of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018. On May 7, 2020, we consummated the issuance and sale of $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.000% Senior Notes due 2026 (the "Additional Notes"). The proceeds from the Additional Notes were used to pay down the amount outstanding on the Company's 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Notes and Additional Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries.
Equity Financing
Trust Common Shares
The Trust is authorized to issue 500,000,000 Trust common shares and the Company is authorized to issue a corresponding number of LLC interests. The Company will, at all times have an equal amount of LLC interests outstanding as Trust shares. At December 31, 2020, there were 64.9 million Trust common shares outstanding.
Secondary Offering
In May 2020, the Company completed an offering of 5,000,000 Trust common shares at a public offering price of $17.60 per share. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting the underwriter's discount and offering costs, totaled approximately $83.9 million.
Trust Preferred Shares
The Trust is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 million Trust preferred shares and the Company is authorized to issue a corresponding number of Trust Interests. We issued 4,000,000 7.250% Series A Preferred Shares in 2017, 4,000,000 7.875% Series B Preferred Shares in 2018 and 4,600,000 7.875% Series C Preferred Shares in 2019. 
We intend to finance future acquisitions through our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, cash on hand and, if necessary, additional equity and debt financings. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with the capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third party financing specifically related to the acquisition of individual businesses, provides us with an advantage in acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In this respect, we believe that in the future, we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financings, or offer equity in Holdings or target businesses to the sellers of such target businesses, in order to fund multiple future acquisitions. 
Our Businesses
We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups of businesses (i) branded consumer businesses, and (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are characterized as those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product category. Niche industrial businesses are characterized as those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling particular products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sector.
The following table represents the percentage of net revenue and operating income each of our businesses contributed to our consolidated results since the date of acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and the total assets of each of our businesses as a percentage of the consolidated total as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Branded Consumer Businesses
5.11 
Overview
5.11 is a leading provider of purpose-built technical apparel and gear for law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, and military special operations as well as outdoor and adventure enthusiasts. 5.11 is a brand known for innovation and authenticity, and works directly with end users to create purpose-built apparel, footwear and gear designed to enhance the safety, accuracy, speed and performance of tactical professionals and enthusiasts worldwide. Headquartered in Irvine, California, 5.11 operates sales offices and distribution centers globally. 5.11 products are widely distributed in uniform stores, military exchanges, outdoor retail stores, its own retail stores and through e-commerce channels, including 511tactical.com.
History of 5.11
5.11 was formed in 2003 after spinning out of outdoor apparel company, Royal Robbins®. The roots of 5.11, however, trace back to 1975, when American rock climber Royal Robbins designed the 5.11® Pant; named after the difficulty level in the Yosemite Decimal System rating scale for rock climbing. With difficulty levels ranging at the time from 5.0 (easy) to 5.10 (difficult), 5.11 was then described: “After thorough inspection, you conclude this move is impossible; however, occasionally someone actually accomplishes it.” 
A product designed for people who were pushing the limits of what was possible, the 5.11® Pant was a success among climbers and outdoor enthusiasts. In 1992, the FBI Academy, in Quantico, Virginia adopted the original 5.11® Pant as its primary training pant, forging a decades-long relationship that supports 5.11’s commitment to the public safety and the first responder communities.
In 2011, 5.11’s corporate headquarters was relocated from Modesto, California to Irvine, California. In 2012, 5.11 acquired the assets of Beyond Clothing LLC, a technical survival systems outerwear company located in Seattle, Washington. We acquired a majority interest in 5.11 on August 31, 2016.
Industry
5.11 participates in the global professional and consumer soft goods market for tactical gear and apparel; the addressable global soft goods market was estimated by management to be approximately $79 billion. 
The domestic professional public safety market for tactical soft goods was estimated by management to be a $1.7 billion market consisting of sales to active-duty military, law enforcement, private security, fire, corrections officers and EMS. The addressable domestic work wear and consumer wear markets were estimated by management to be $4.3 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively. 
The international professional public safety market for tactical soft goods was estimated by management to be a $11.7 billion market. The addressable international work wear and consumer wear markets were estimated by management to be $11.4 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively. 
Products and Services
5.11 offers a portfolio of unique head-to-toe technical gear with patented functional features for both professional and consumer use. No individual product style accounts for more than 8% of total sales, and most product styles tend to have multi-year lifecycles. 5.11 focuses its product offering through six major categories: technical apparel, bags and packs, footwear, special make ups/uniforms, accessories, and Beyond Clothing Systems (“Beyond”).
Technical apparel represents 5.11’s largest product category. Within this category, 5.11 offers a broad assortment of men’s and women’s pants, shorts, shirts, outerwear and base layers. Apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility. 5.11 has historically designed and developed innovative “families” of products around proprietary fabrics that the company has created to meet the needs of its unique target market. These product “families” typically start with a pant and then expand into other products. Today, 5.11 offers five distinct pant lines, which anchor five different apparel families: the Defender Flex Pant, the Apex™ Pant, the 5.11 Stryke™ Pant, the Taclite® Pro Pant, and the 5.11® Tactical Pant.
5.11 bags and packs provide reliable, multifunctional storage options designed to excel in a wide range of operational and recreational settings. This category includes backpacks, cases, load-bearing equipment, range bags and duffels. In addition to bags/packs and apparel, 5.11 sells footwear, including boots, low-profile tactical shoes, socks and accessories, as well as special make ups or customized uniforms for public safety agencies. 5.11 also offers a wide selection of accessories including belts, hats, flashlights, gloves, knives, eyewear, watches, patches, slings and holsters.
Beyond, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 5.11, offers technical survival outerwear systems engineered specifically for missions in extreme conditions. Products are marketed under the Beyond brand name and include base layers and briefs, pullovers, softshell jackets, wind pants, rain pants and jackets made of advanced fabrics. Virtually all Beyond products are manufactured in the United States to comply with the Berry Amendment.
5.11’s core product offerings and suggested average retail prices are listed below:
•Pants and Shorts (Men’s and Women’s) - $37.99 to $269.99
•Woven Tops (Men’s and Women’s) - $39.99 to $269.99
•Outerwear (Men’s and Women’s) - $34.99 to $449.99
•Footwear (Men’s and Women’s) - $79.99 to $219.99
•Bags and Packs - $59.99 to $349.99
•Accessories - $4.99 to $139.99
Competitive Strengths
Leading Brand Recognition and Market Share - 5.11 is a leader in the technical apparel market. 5.11 enjoys strong brand awareness and affinity in the public safety market given its long history of creating high performance and innovative products for public safety operators. 5.11’s heritage of developing purpose-built clothing and gear for law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, and military special operations has imbued the 5.11 brand with unrivaled authenticity in the technical apparel and gear markets.
Diverse Customer Base - 5.11 has direct relationships with over 14,500 governmental departments and agencies, and utilizes an established network of over 3,200 dealers in over 130 countries. 5.11 wins a significant amount of 
business in the public safety channel through the achievement of “specified” product in thousands of individual contracts with governmental departments and agencies, providing for a broad base of long-term relationships.
Product Breadth and “At-Once” Availability - Requirements of outfitting entire agencies or departments necessitates carrying numerous, often infrequently used, sizes and colors of a given product. These requirements, coupled with “at-once” product fulfillment demands, make 5.11 the go-to provider of technical gear and apparel. 5.11’s significant investment in inventory provides a competitive advantage versus its smaller less well capitalized competitors that carry low levels of inventory.
Business Strategies
Further Expand into Consumer Market - We believe 5.11 is well-positioned to continue investing in retail locations throughout the United States. 5.11 currently has seventy-five company-owned retail locations, and management believes that there are significant opportunities to increase this footprint as well as drive omni-channel sales through 511tactical.com and online sales. 5.11 also sells to many outdoor specialty retailers and management believes there are opportunities to expand sales through increased penetration and improved merchandising.
Continue Penetration of Domestic Professional Channel - 5.11 continues to benefit from the domestic professional public safety market, which provides a stable base of recurring growth. Going forward, 5.11 will continue to grow within the domestic professional public safety channel through (i) continued conversion of institutional contract opportunity pipeline; and (ii) market share gains from continued product innovation and improved merchandising.
International Market Expansion - The international market remains an under-penetrated opportunity for 5.11. 5.11 will continue international sales development through building country-specific sales and operations infrastructure, executing on both near and medium term large foreign government contract opportunities, and expanding consumer awareness of the 5.11 brand.
Customers and Distribution Channels
5.11 services a wide range of customers including first responders, the military, and outdoors enthusiasts in over 130 countries. The primary distribution channels can be segmented into two categories: professional and consumer. 5.11's working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet the requirements of its customers.
The domestic professional channel is characterized by thousands of unique “specified” product contracts with individual public safety departments, serviced through a network of more than one-thousand local third party dealers. Public safety departments include federal, state, county, city and local law enforcement, firefighters, and EMS. Similar to the domestic professional channel, the international professional channel also consists of many unique “specified” product contracts with individual foreign governmental departments, serviced either directly by 5.11 or through a network of international dealers. Large contracts with government agencies are referred to as Direct-to-Agency (“DTA”); a typical DTA sales process is driven primarily by lengthy governmental approval processes and can take upwards of 18 to 36 months. 
Within the consumer segment, the consumer wholesale channel is comprised of (i) outdoor specialty retailers, (ii) military exchanges, and (iii) online. The consumer direct channel is comprised of (i) e-commerce sales directly through the 5.11 website, www.511tactical.com, and (ii) company-owned retail stores. At the end of 2020, 5.11 operated seventy-three company-owned retail locations in twenty-five states. 
Professional channel sales accounted for approximately 52% in the year ended December 31, 2020, 58% of total sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 and 64% of total sales in the year ended December 31, 2018; approximately 3% of total sales in 2020 and 1% of total sales in 2019 and 2018 were in the form of DTA sales. The consumer channel accounted for approximately 46% of total sales in 2020, 41% of total sales in 2019 and 35% of total sales in 2018. 
5.11’s top 10 customers comprised approximately 20%, 19% and 21% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
5.11’s sales organization consists of a mix of direct employees, independent contractors and sales agencies. The domestic salesforce develops direct relationships with thousands of individual public safety departments around the 
U.S. and participates in thousands of requests for proposal (RFP) processes annually. The salesforce works directly with over 1,400 local dealers to service local public safety departments once a 5.11 product receives “spec” as part of the RFP process. 
The international salesforce covers three primary regions: Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Latin America. While the company does fulfill some orders directly to international customers through its 5.11 website, most sales are serviced through third party distributors and dealers in foreign jurisdictions.
5.11 has implemented a multi-pronged marketing plan including investments in (i) professional and consumer product catalogues; (ii) print media; (iii) tradeshows; (iv) shop-in-shop retail concepts; and (v) digital and social media content.
5.11 had open orders and backlog of $21.8 million and $21.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Suppliers
5.11 operates an efficient, low-cost supply chain, sourcing most its products through contract manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region. Production from Vietnam accounted for approximately 38% of 5.11’s purchases for the year ended December 31, 2020 and represented 5.11’s largest sourcing region. No single core product is 100% sourced by any one vendor. Management believes that 5.11’s principal manufacturers have the additional capacity to accommodate future growth.
Beyond products are sourced primarily through domestic subcontract facilities in the United States.
To ensure vendor reliability and quality, 5.11 established a sourcing office in Hong Kong. The office employs approximately 46 individuals whose primary functions include vendor management, commercialization, product development, production planning, vendor compliance, quality assurance and compliance. 
Intellectual Property 
5.11 relies on brand name recognition and a combination of trademarks and patents in order to differentiate itself from the competition. 5.11 currently has 26 utility patents and 14 design patents issued, in addition to 11 utility and 8 design patents pending registration. 5.11 currently owns 386 registered trademarks including 3 trade dress registrations. The company has in-house general counsel that manages the registration and defense of 5.11 intellectual property.
Regulatory Environment
Management is not aware of any existing, pending, or contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on 5.11’s business. 5.11 is proactive regarding regulatory issues and is in compliance with all relevant regulations. Management is not aware of any potential environmental issues.
Human Capital
5.11 maintains a global footprint, with employees working in thirty-three states and eighteen countries. At December 31, 2020, 5.11 had 797 full-time employees and 154 part-time employees. 5.11 believes their relationship with their employees is good.
BOA
Overview
BOA, creator of the revolutionary, award-winning, patented BOA Fit System, partners with market-leading brands to make the best gear even better. Delivering fit solutions purpose-built for performance, the BOA Fit System is featured in footwear across snow sports, cycling, hiking/trekking, golf, running, court sports, workwear as well as headwear and medical bracing. The system consists of three integral parts: a micro-adjustable dial, high-tensile lightweight laces, and low friction lace guides creating a superior alternative to laces, buckles, Velcro, and other traditional closure mechanisms. Each unique BOA configuration is engineered for fast, effortless, precision fit, and is backed by The BOA Lifetime Guarantee. BOA is headquartered in Denver, Colorado and has offices in Austria, Greater China, South Korea, and Japan.
History of BOA
BOA was founded in 2001 by Gary Hammerslag, a snowboarder, surfer, and entrepreneur. Gary moved to Steamboat, Colorado in the mid-90’s after successfully selling his previous company, which created innovative catheter solutions that improved angioplasty procedure speed and effectiveness. After arriving in Steamboat and frequently snowboarding, Gary envisioned a possibility to dramatically improve the fit and performance of snowboard boots by applying elements of his learnings in the medical device field. Gary developed a fit system as an alternative to traditional laces for snowboard boots and partnered with K2 and Vans to launch the first BOA-equipped snowboard boots to consumers in the winter of 2001. After a successful launch, BOA became widely adopted on snowboard boots. 
BOA’s next phase of growth was largely in the outdoor sporting and recreation markets. In 2005, BOA expanded its focus to hiking and trail-related footwear, followed by cycling and golf in 2006 and hunting and fishing in 2007, at which point BOA surpassed 1 million users worldwide. From 2008 to 2011, having gained credibility in consumer markets, BOA introduced products for the workwear footwear market as well as products for the medical bracing market. In 2013, the company entered the running and training footwear market. 
In 2019, BOA launched its state-of-the-art Performance Fit Lab ("PFL") to quantitatively measure the impact of BOA-equipped footwear on athletic performance. The PFL is used to advance performance footwear fit technology by testing, refining, and improving footwear products in collaboration with the company’s major brand partners and serves as a catalyst for innovation. In 2020, BOA surpassed 17 million users worldwide.
We purchased a majority interest in BOA on October 16, 2020 for approximately $454 million.
Industry
BOA participates broadly in the global footwear market, representing approximately 10 billion pairs of shoes sold annually. BOA’s addressable market is identified based on product type, price lane, and geography. BOA targets the premium segment, where applicable price lanes tend to be at the upper end of each category. With respect to product type, the overall market is segmented into various subcategories, of which BOA primarily targets footwear for active performance sports, outdoor applications, and kids. Based on target footwear categories and applicable price lanes, management estimates BOA’s addressable market to be approximately 750 million pairs of shoes sold annually. Management estimates the company has approximately 2-3% share within its addressable market. 
Products 
The BOA Fit System consists of a durable lace, which is guided by low-friction guides and attached to a dial that is typically mounted on the footwear heel, tongue or eye-stay for micro-adjustability to enhance performance fit. BOA’s current product portfolio has four platforms, H, L, M, and S-Series, which vary in cost, weight, tension, and use case. Each dial design can be customized with over 220 colors allowing the product to fit cohesively with each brand partners’ specific designs and colorways.
All platforms share the distinctive characteristics that differentiate BOA from competing offerings: micro-adjustability to achieve the perfect fit, measurable performance benefits validated by the company’s testing lab, durability and quality proven in extensive field testing, a lifetime guarantee on the end-product’s dial and laces, and the distinctive BOA sound heard when turning the dial.
Each platform is designed and engineered to address the specific performance fit needs of the end user by use case. Factors such as size and shape of dial, level of torque, internal mechanics, and weight vary amongst platforms, and each platform is further segmented into product collections that differ in aesthetic, optimal placement on the shoe, and cost. Within each product collection, dial designs and materials differ to accommodate preferences of the end user and retail price points of the end product.
Competitive Strengths
Culture of Innovation and New Product Development - Management believes that there is significant opportunity to continue advancing product offerings through its commitment to innovation. Product development and innovation are divided amongst (i) BOA’s internal innovation and evolution of its fit systems and platforms, refining and improving on the aesthetics, durability, user experience, and price/value, (ii) the design and engineering collaboration that BOA engages in with its brand partners for project and application-specific needs, and (iii) BOA’s advanced research through its PFL, which is transforming markets through innovative performance fit solutions that are scientifically tested and validated.
Deep Collaborative Partnerships – BOA has deep partnerships with the premier brands in every segment they compete within. They collaborate throughout the entire product lifecycle process, including product strategy, design and development, factory operational/service support, retail education, consumer warranty support, and marketing/demand creation. BOA has a high partner retention rate due to the depth and value of the relationships.
Premium Brand Position - BOA is focused on continuing to build awareness around its aspirational, global brand through content leadership, athlete endorsements, paid media, brand partner affiliations, and other business. BOA primarily increases awareness through direct-to-consumer marketing and co-marketing with its established brand partner relationships. In 2019, BOA launched its “Pioneer Program,” an athletic sponsorship platform. BOA leverages athlete endorsements to further establish its positioning as a performance fit leader as well as drive cross-segment brand awareness. The company recently launched its “Dialed in” Campaign, which showcases pioneers performing at their peak both physically and mentally. BOA also relies on its trusted brand partners to increase BOA brand awareness. The company focuses its efforts on collaborating with brand partners who are innovative market leaders that meet BOA’s brand standards and align with BOA’s positioning as a high-performance, premium brand. 
Technology Leader with Robust Patent Portfolio – BOA is a leader in performance fit innovation and has built a diverse global portfolio of issued and pending utility and design patents, creating barriers to entry. Throughout BOA’s history, the company has continually innovated on dial attributes including quick release, durability, manufacturing ease, and micro adjustability, in addition to integrated lace and lace guide designs and configurations critical to imparting precision fit and reduced friction. BOA’s engineering and technical expertise enables the development and production of performance fit solutions, allowing their brand partners to offer performance enhancing technology and product differentiation. 
Business Strategies
Continued Share Growth in Established Categories - BOA has established a strong presence in certain core categories in Northern Europe, Korea, Japan, and the United States where BOA has proven efficacy and established strong brand partner relationships. In these core categories, BOA is focused on building a community to cross market to and is actively working to reimagine product solutions to deliver the best product to consumers. 
Going forward, BOA intends to leverage its brand partner relationships to expand penetration and capture additional share in growing markets such as workwear in North America and Asia, outdoor in markets outside of Korea, and golf in North America. BOA has developed region and category specific products to better cater to the individual dynamics of each market including products that deliver a better price/value proposition, new product configurations for region specific trends and performance fit messaging to increase consumer awareness and adoption. Through its reputation in the marketplace, athlete endorsements and deep relationships with leading brand partners, the company is focused on delivering the performance benefits of the BOA system across an expanding set of sporting categories and geographies.
Expand into Pioneering Categories - BOA has identified several adjacent segments including alpine skiing, trail running, and court sports such as tennis, badminton and basketball which management believes are well suited to benefit from the performance fit that BOA provides. BOA is actively working with leading brand partners to develop sport-specific footwear configurations that can benefit from the advantages of the BOA system. By leveraging BOA’s brand equity and proven solutions, the company believes there is significant whitespace to increase penetration in these early adoption segments.
Research and Development
BOA’s approach to new product development is a multi-stage, cross-functional process. For each new product introduction, BOA works closely with brand partners to identify or develop the best suited BOA solution, its optimal placement on the shoe (or other application), color and design specifications, and cost targets. On existing products, BOA is committed to continuous innovation, including key improvements such as lower installation costs for brand partner factories, thinner and sleeker product profiles for improved aesthetics, in field warranty rate reduction to 0.5%, improved user experience, and the broadening of the platform suite to address key opportunities in alpine skiing, basketball, and outdoor. 
As part of BOA’s innovation strategy around improving fit, the company has invested in a state-of-the-art PFL to quantitatively measure the impact of the BOA system on end products. In partnership with the University of Denver, the PFL is testing a significant number of products to evaluate a) Agility & Speed, b) Power & Precision, and c) Endurance & Health. By addressing these global performance attributes rather than segment-by-segment specific 
needs, PFL findings will be relevant and applicable across BOA’s segments. The results of these studies are anticipated to help further validate BOA’s value proposition and contribute to the strengthening of the company’s brand. Moreover, the PFL serves as a platform to test and refine new product offerings ahead of launch.
Customers and Distribution Channels
BOA has 400+ global brand partners, including leading footwear companies such as Adidas, New Balance, Specialized, Asics, Burton, Engelbert Strauss, La Sportiva and FootJoy who feature BOA systems across a variety of sporting and professional segments including cycling, golf, snowboarding, hiking and workwear, among others. BOA typically sells directly to the manufacturing partner responsible for final assembly of the brand partner’s product. BOA works with 490+ brand partner factories with limited revenue concentration. Most brand partner factories are located in Asia, primarily in China and Vietnam, and are in close proximity to BOA’s supply chain. 
Rather than being solely an OEM part supplier, BOA maintains highly collaborative relationships with its brand partners to actively co-develop innovative, performance-driven footwear designed around the BOA system. BOA contributes substantial design and testing resources to ensure its system is used in a way that maximizes performance based on dial placement and configuration. The BOA system is not simply a “lace replacement” or plug and play option, but rather a solution that must be integrated into each footwear model through a 6-18 month development cycle to create a system that works specifically with a shoe’s unique structural design. This process allows BOA to ensure brand image consistency, end product quality and the best performance fit. 
Footwear, headwear, and medical bracing products featuring BOA systems are primarily sold through brick-and-mortar sporting goods retailers, specialty footwear retailers, online retailers, or brand partners’ owned retail and online channels. According to management’s estimates, end consumption is geographically diverse, with approximately 15% of products reaching consumers in North America, 35% in Europe, and 50% in Asia. 
No individual customer or brand partner factory represented greater than 6% of BOA’s net revenues in 2020.
Seasonality
Due to the diversity of sporting segments BOA participates in, there is no significant seasonality to the business, though BOA typically has higher sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher cycling and golf sales in preparation for the spring retail season, as well as higher sales in the second quarter each year due to purchasing trends in the snow sports segment.
Competition
BOA’s competition can be segmented into three categories: established footwear brands that maintain their own proprietary technology for particular market segments, lower-quality subscale BOA imitators, and non-mechanical lace alternatives (bungies, buckles, plastic lace locks, Velcro, and webbing). Management estimates that BOA is 20+ times the size of its next closest direct competitor.
Suppliers
BOA maintains a longstanding deep relationship with a sole supplier for plastic injected parts (dial units and lace guides), representing approximately 70% of total purchases. The vendor is based in China with multiple facilities. Furthermore, the vendor has supplied the company since 2001 and has continuously invested in its tools and infrastructure to maintain quality standards and keep up with demand. BOA owns all its injection molds. Lastly, the vendor is also a minority shareholder in BOA and is committed to supporting its growth. The remainder of BOA’s purchases are for steel and steel coated lace, textile laces and guides, monofilament lace and webbing, which are sourced from China, Korea, Europe, and the U.S. Management believes its manufacturing partners have sufficient capacity to accommodate future growth.
Intellectual Property
BOA has built a diverse global portfolio of 233 issued and pending utility and design patents. The company has created 37 patent “families” with intellectual property covering its core technology (dials, guides, laces), as well as strategic configurations and component installation methods. BOA maintains 9 Trademarks in 41 countries.
Regulatory Environment
Management is not aware of any existing, pending, or contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on BOA’s business. BOA is proactive regarding regulatory issues and is in compliance with all relevant regulations. 
BOA maintains adequate product liability insurance coverage and to date has not incurred any material losses. Management is not aware of any potential environmental issues.
Human Capital
BOA employees are located in four countries and the United States. At December 31, 2020, BOA had 226 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees. 126 employees are located in the United States and 105 work outside of the United States in Austria, Greater China, Japan, and Korea. BOA maintains a high retention rate of their employees and believes the company's relationship with its employees is good.
Ergobaby
Overview
Ergobaby is dedicated to building a global community of confident parents with smart, ergonomic solutions that enable and encourage bonding between parents and babies. Ergobaby offers a broad range of award-winning baby carriers, blankets and swaddlers, nursing pillows, strollers, and related products that fit into families’ daily lives seamlessly, comfortably and safely.  Ergobaby is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.
History of Ergobaby
Ergobaby was founded in 2003 by Karin Frost, who designed her first baby carrier following the birth of her son. The baby carrier product line has since expanded into 3-position and 4-position carriers, with multiple style variations. In its second year of operations, Ergobaby sold 10,500 baby carriers and today sells over 1 million a year. In order to support the rapid growth, in 2007, Ergobaby made a strategic decision to establish an operating subsidiary (“EBEU”) in Hamburg, Germany. We purchased a majority interest in Ergobaby on September 16, 2010.
On May 12, 2016, Ergobaby acquired membership interests of New Baby Tula LLC (“Baby Tula”) for approximately $73.8 million. Baby Tula designs, markets and distributes premium baby carriers and accessories and focuses its efforts on both the ergonomics and fashion of its products.
In 2014, Ergobaby launched the Ergobaby Four-Position 360 Baby Carrier which expanded on Ergobaby’s leadership in the baby carrier category by offering an ergonomic, outward forward facing position for the baby and comfort for the parent. The Ergobaby 360 Carrier won the 2014 JPMA Innovation award in the baby carrier category. In 2016, Ergobaby launched the 3-Position Adapt Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and offers some unique parent comfort features including lumbar support and crossable shoulder straps, as well as the benefit of being an all-in-one carrier with no need for an infant insert accessory (for babies 7-12lbs.). In 2017, Ergobaby launched the All Position, All-in-One Omni 360 Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and includes all of Ergobaby’s parent & baby comfort features from the 360 and Adapt Baby Carriers, as well as the same consumer benefit of no infant insert accessory needed. 
In 2018, Ergobaby entered into the stroller category with 2 new models. The first product launched was a full-size option called the 180 Reversible Stroller. This was followed later in the year by a premium compact option, the Metro Compact City Stroller. In 2019, Ergobaby launched the Embrace Baby Carrier which is geared for newborns (7lbs-25lbs) and merges the coziness of a soft wrap carrier with the simplicity and comfort of a structured carrier. In 2020, Ergobaby launched Everlove, a first of its kind carrier buyback, restoration, and resell program to extend the lifecycle of our carriers for a more sustainable future.
Industry
Ergobaby competes in the large and expanding infant and juvenile products industry. The industry exhibits little seasonality and is somewhat insulated from overall economic trends, as parents view spending on children as largely non-discretionary in nature. Consequently, parents spend consistently on their children, particularly on durable items, such as car seats, strollers, baby carriers, and related items that are viewed as necessities. Further, an emotional component is often a factor in parents’ purchasing decisions, as parents’ desire to purchase the best and safest products for their children. As a result, according to the USDA’s most recent report on Expenditures on Children by Families 2015 (March 2017), parents on average, spend between $9,330 and $23,380 on their child on an annual basis for related housing, food, transportation, clothes, healthcare, daycare and other items, depending on age of the child and annual income. The amount spent by parents in the highest income group (before tax income greater than $107,400) was more than twice the amounts spent by parents in the lowest income group 
(before tax income of less than $59,200). On average, households spent between 11 - 27% of their before-tax income on a child. Similar patterns are seen in other countries around the world.
Demand drivers fueling the growing spending on infant and juvenile products include favorable demographic trends, such as (i) a high percentage of first time births; (ii) an increasing age of first time mothers and a large percentage of working mothers with increased disposable income; and (iii) an increasing percentage of single child households and two-family households.
In purchases of baby durables, parents often seek well-known and trusted brands that offer a sense of comfort regarding a product’s reliability and safety. As a result, brand name, comfort and safety certifications can serve as a barrier to entry for competition in the market, as well as allow well-known brands such as Ergobaby and Baby Tula to compete in a growing premium segment.
Products and Services
Baby Carriers
Ergobaby has two main baby carrier product lines: baby carriers and related carrier accessories, sold under both the Ergobaby and Tula brands. Ergobaby’s baby carrier designs supports a natural, ergonomic ("M" shaped) sitting position for babies, eliminating compression of the spine and hips that can be caused by unsupported suspension. The baby carrier also distributes the baby’s weight evenly between parents’ hips and shoulders, and alleviates physical stress for the parent. Both Ergobaby’s 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers have been recognized by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute as being “hip healthy”. Additional accessories are provided to complement the baby carriers including the popular Infant Insert.
Within the Ergobaby Baby Carrier product line, Ergo sells 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers in a variety of style and color variations and Baby Tula sells 3-Position and 4-Position fashion-oriented baby carriers. Baby Carrier sales were approximately $73.9 million, $85.0 million, and $85.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 89%, 88% and 89%, of total sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Within the baby carrier accessories category, the Infant Insert is the largest sales component of the accessory category but has seen declining sales as customer move to newborn ready carriers. Accessory sales were $4.5 million, $5.9 million, and $6.7 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 5.4% in 2020, 6.1% in 2019 and 7.0% in 2018, of total sales.
Ergobaby’s core Baby Carrier product offerings with average retail prices are summarized below:
Ergo
•6 styles of baby carriers - $80 - $180
•2 styles of Infant Inserts - $35 - $38
Tula 
•7 styles of baby carriers - $79 - $1,000
•1 style of Infant Inserts - $20
Competitive Strengths
Ergobaby innovation - Ergobaby Carriers are known for their unsurpassed comfort. Ergobaby’s superior design results in improved comfort for both parent and baby. Parents are comfortable because baby’s weight is evenly distributed between the hips and shoulders while baby sits ergonomically in a natural ("M" shaped) sitting position. The concept of baby carrying has increased in popularity in the U.S. as parents recognize the emotional and functional benefits of carrying their baby. Consumers continually cite the comfort, design, and convenient “hands free” mobility the Ergobaby carrier offers as key purchasing criteria. Ergobaby is also recognized as an industry leader in innovation. With the launch of the Ergo 4-Position 360 Carrier in 2014, the launch of the 3-Position ADAPT carrier in 2016, the launch of the All Position Omni 360 carrier in 2017, and the launch of the Embrace carrier in 2019, Ergobaby continues to innovate in the baby carrier segment on a regular basis.
Baby Tula Community - Tula enjoys an active and enthusiastic community who are vocal advocates for the brand. The Tula community acts as both an avid source of feedback on new product launches, which influence future product and patterns, as well as brand influencers to the broader new parenting community.
Business Strategies
Increase Penetration of Current U.S. Distribution Channels - Ergobaby continues to benefit from steady expansion of the market for wearable baby carriers and related accessories in the U.S. and internationally. Going forward, Ergobaby will continue to leverage and expand the awareness of its outstanding brands (both Ergobaby and Baby Tula) in order to capture additional market share in the U.S., as parents increasingly recognize the enhanced mobility, convenience, and the ability to remain close to the child that all Ergobaby carriers enable. Ergobaby currently markets its products to consumers in the U.S. through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers, and directly through Ergobaby.com and Babytula.com websites. 
International Market Expansion - Testimony to the global strength of its lifestyle brand, Ergobaby has historically derived approximately 60% of its sales from international markets. Like it has in the U.S., Ergobaby can continue to leverage the Ergo and Tula brand equity in the international markets it currently serves to aggressively drive future growth, as well as expand its international presence into new regions. The market for Ergobaby’s products abroad continues to grow rapidly, in part due to the fact that in many parts of Europe and Asia, the concept of baby wearing is a culturally entrenched form of infant and child transport.
New Product Development - Management believes Ergobaby has an opportunity to leverage its unique, authentic lifestyle brands and expand its product line. Since its founding in 2003, Ergobaby has successfully introduced new carrier products to maintain innovation, uniqueness, and freshness within its baby carrier and travel system product lines and has become the baby carrier industry leader with the Omni 360 baby carrier. In addition to expanding into new product carriers like swaddling and nursing pillows, in 2018, Ergobaby entered the stroller category by introducing a new premium compact stroller (Metro Compact City Stroller) and a full-size stroller (180 Reversible Stroller).
Customers and Distribution Channels
Ergobaby primarily sells its products through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers and distributors. In Europe, Ergobaby products are sold through its German based subsidiary, which services brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers in Germany and France; it’s United Kingdom based subsidiary; and its Tula subsidiary in Poland; as well as a network of distributors located in Sweden, Norway, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, Russia and the Ukraine. Customers in Canada are predominately serviced by Ergobaby’s Canadian subsidiary. Sales to customers outside of the U.S., Canadian and European markets are predominantly serviced through distributors granted rights, though not necessarily exclusive, to sell within a specific geographic region.
Sales and Marketing
Within the U.S., Ergobaby directly employs sales professionals and utilizes independent sales representatives assigned to differing U.S. territories managed by in-house sales professionals. Independent salespeople in the U.S. are paid on a commission basis based on customer type and sales territory. In Europe, Ergobaby directly employs its salespeople and salespeople are paid a base salary and a commission on their sales, which is standard in that territory.
Ergobaby has implemented a multi-faceted marketing plan which includes (i) online marketing efforts, including online advertisement, search engine optimization and social networking efforts; (ii) increasing tradeshow attendance at consumer and medical professional shows; and (iii) increasing promotional activities.
Ergobaby had approximately $11.5 million and $10.2 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Competition
The infant and juvenile products market is fragmented, with a few larger manufacturers and marketers with portfolios of brands and a multitude of smaller, private companies with relatively targeted product offerings.
Within the infant and juvenile products market, Ergobaby’s baby carriers primarily compete with companies that market wearable baby carriers. Within the wearable baby carrier market, several distinct segments exist, including (i) slings and wraps; (ii) soft-structured baby carriers; and (iii) hard frame baby carriers.
The primary global competitors in this segment are BabyBjorn, Chicco, Britax and Manduca, which also market products in the premium price range. Especially in the U.S., Ergobaby brands also compete with several smaller 
companies that have developed wearable carriers, such as Infantino, Boba, and Lillebaby. Within the soft-structured baby carrier segment, Ergobaby benefits from strong distribution, good word of mouth, and the functionality of the design.
Suppliers
During 2020, Ergobaby sourced its Ergo carrier and carrier accessory products from Vietnam and India, and manufactured its stroller systems and accessory products in China. Baby Tula products predominantly were produced from factories in India and Poland and were also produced in its own facility located in Poland. In 2009, Ergobaby partnered with a manufacturer located in India, and in 2012, Ergobaby began sourcing carriers and accessories from a manufacturing facility in Vietnam.  More than 50% of Ergobaby’s carriers and accessories came from Vietnam in 2020. Baby Tula sourced its carrier, accessories and blanket products from Poland, Vietnam and India, with purchases from these locations accounted for approximately 13% of total Ergobaby purchases.  Management believes its manufacturing partners have the additional capacity to accommodate Ergobaby’s projected growth.
Intellectual Property
Ergobaby maintains and defends a U.S. and international patent portfolio on some of its various products, including its 3-position and 4-position carriers.  Currently, it has 31 patents (including allowances) and 27 patents pending in the U.S. and other countries. Ergobaby also depends on brand name recognition and premium product offering to differentiate itself from competition.
Regulatory Environment
Management is not aware of any existing, pending, or contingent liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on Ergobaby’s business. Ergobaby is proactive regarding regulatory issues and is in compliance with all relevant regulations. Ergobaby maintains adequate product liability insurance coverage and to date has not incurred any losses. Management is not aware of any potential environmental issues.
Human Capital
Ergobaby employees maintain a global footprint, with a geographic presence in the United States, Europe and Asia. At December 31, 2020, Ergobaby had 154 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. 75 employees are located in the United States and 89 work outside of the United States, with the largest international presence in Poland and Germany. Ergobaby believes the company's relationship with its employees is good.
Liberty Safe
Overview
Liberty Safe, headquartered in Payson, Utah and founded in 1988, is the premier designer, manufacturer, and marketer of home, gun and office safes in North America. From its over 300,000 square foot manufacturing facility, Liberty Safe produces a wide range of home, office and gun safe models in a broad assortment of sizes, features and styles ranging from an entry level product to good, better and best products. Products are marketed under the Liberty Safe brand, as well as a portfolio of licensed and private label brands, including Cabela’s and John Deere. Liberty Safe’s products are the market share leader and are sold through an independent dealer network (“Dealer sales”) in addition to various sporting goods, farm and fleet, and home improvement retail outlets (“Non-Dealer sales” or “National sales”). Liberty Safe also sells safes directly to end customers through the company's website. Liberty Safe has the largest independent dealer network in the industry, with more than 50% of Liberty's sales in the last two years coming from the dealer network.
History of Liberty Safe
The Liberty Safe brand and its leading market share has been built over a 30-year history of superior product quality, engineering and design innovation, and leading customer service and sales support. Liberty Safe has a long history of continuous improvement and innovative approaches to sales and marketing, product development and manufacturing processes. Significant investments over the last five years have solidified Liberty Safe’s reputation for providing substantial value to retailers and enhanced its long-standing position as the leading producer of premium home, office and gun safes.
Liberty Safe commenced operations in 1988 and in 2001 opened its current state-of-the-art facility in Payson, Utah. The new facility allowed Liberty Safe to consolidate all of its manufacturing and distribution operations to a centralized location. As the only facility in the industry utilizing significant automation and a streamlined roll-form manufacturing process, it represented a significant step forward when compared to the production capabilities of its competitors. Incremental investments following the consolidation have solidified Liberty Safe’s position as the preeminent domestic manufacturer of secure storage solutions.
During 2011, Liberty Safe constructed a new production line that allowed Liberty to build entry level safe products in-house. This production line produces home and gun safe models that were previously completely sourced through foreign manufacturers. This investment in production capacity makes Liberty Safe one of the largest manufacturers of home, office and gun safes in the world. This added investment in capacity in the U.S. allowed Liberty Safe to provide shorter lead times and more competitive pricing to its North American customer base. 
We purchased a majority interest in Liberty Safe on March 31, 2010.
Industry
Liberty Safe competes in the broadly defined North American safe and vault industry which includes fire and document safes, media and data safes, depository safes, gun safes and cabinets, home safes and hotel safes. The total domestic residential safes market is estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion and is projected to grow 2-3% through 2025. Domestically, demand for safes depends on several key factors, including greater awareness of the need to store valuables and firearms securely, increased uncertainty and civil unrest in the country, and an increased prevalence of severe weather events. 
The domestic safe industry continues to see increased competition from imports, particularly those sourced from China. Imported safes compete on price, with foreign manufacturers passing along savings from operational efficiencies, lower cost labor and raw materials to the end consumer.
Products and Services
Liberty Safe offers home, office and gun safes with retail prices ranging from $400 to $8,000. Liberty Safe produces 32 home and gun safe models with the most varied assortment of sizes, feature upgrades, accessories and styling options in the industry. Liberty Safe’s premium home and gun safe product line covers sizes from 12 cu. ft. to 50 cu. ft. with smaller sizes available for its personal home safe. Liberty Safe markets its products under Company-owned brands and a portfolio of licensed and private label brands, including Cabela’s and John Deere. Liberty Safe also sells commercial safes, vault doors, handgun vaults, and a number of accessories and options. The overwhelming majority of revenue is derived from the sales of safes.
Competitive Strengths
#1 Premium Home and Gun Safe Brand with Strong Momentum in the Market - Liberty Safe achieved the status of #1 selling safe company in America in 1994 (per statistics provided by Sargent & Greenleaf, the primary lock supplier to the industry) and maintains this prominent position today. A recent third-party market study also ranked Liberty Safe #1 in its safe market niche for domestically produced safes. Liberty Safe continues to gain market share from the various smaller participants who lack the distribution, e-commerce and sales and marketing capabilities of Liberty Safe. 
State-of-the-Art and Scalable Operations - Liberty's management has constructed a highly scalable operational platform and infrastructure that has positioned Liberty Safe for substantial sales growth and enhanced profitability in the coming years. Liberty Safe transitioned itself from a manufacturing oriented operating culture to a demand-based, sales-oriented organization. Its strategic transition required the implementation of a demand-based sales and operating platform, which included (i) new equipment to drive automation and capacity improvements; (ii) re-engineered product lines and production processes to drive efficiency through greater standardization in production; and (iii) new employee incentives tied to labor efficiency, which has improved worker performance as well as employee attitude. These initiatives are enhanced by an experienced senior executive team, a balanced sourcing and in-house manufacturing production strategy, advanced distribution capabilities and sophisticated IT systems. Liberty has combined its demand-based sales and operating initiatives with upgraded production equipment to drive multiple operational improvements. These initiatives combined with Liberty’s cumulative historical investments in operational capabilities have created a lasting competitive advantage over its smaller competitors, who utilize labor-intensive operations and lack the company’s lean manufacturing culture. For the past seventeen years, Liberty 
Safe has leased a manufacturing and distribution facility in Payson, Utah that management believes represents the most scalable domestic facility in the industry. Liberty Safe’s multi-faceted production capabilities allow for substantial flexibility and scalable capacity, thus assuring a level of supply chain execution far superior to any of its competitors.
Historically, Liberty Safe maintained an optimal mix of in-house and Asian-sourced manufacturing in order to improve its ability to meet customer inventory needs. Beginning in 2012, Liberty Safe began manufacturing entry level safes that were previously completely sourced from an Asian manufacturer, on its new production line. In 2020, approximately 7% of safes (excluding handgun safes) sold by Liberty were sourced in Asia.
Reputation for High Quality Products - Liberty Safe offers only the highest quality products on a consistent basis, which over the years has gained it an enviable reputation and a key point of differentiation from its competitors. Liberty Safe distinguishes its products through tested security and fire protection features and industry leading design focused on functionality and aesthetics. The design of its safes meets rigorous internal benchmarks for security and fire protection, with most receiving certification from Underwriters Laboratory, Inc. (“UL”), the leading product safety standard certification, for its security capabilities. Additionally, Liberty Safe’s investment in accessories and feature options have made Liberty safes the most visually appealing and functional in the industry, while providing more customized solutions for retailers and consumers. 
Trusted Supplier to National Retailer and Dealer Accounts - Liberty Safe’s comprehensive, high-quality product offering and sophisticated sales and marketing programs have made it a critical supplier to a diverse group of national accounts and dealers. Initially a key supplier primarily to the dealer channel, it has expanded its business with national accounts, such as Cabela’s and Tractor Supply. Liberty Safe provides a superior value proposition as a supplier for its national retailers and dealers via its well-recognized brands, lifetime product warranty, tailored merchandising, category management solutions and superior supply chain execution. Further, Liberty Safe’s products generate more profitable floor-space, with both high absolute gross profit and retail margins over 30%. High retail profitability plus increased inventory turns has entrenched Liberty Safe as a key partner in customers’ success in the safe category. As a core element of building its relationships, Liberty Safe has invested significantly in making its retailers more efficient through cooperative point-of-sale forecasting that improves inventory turnover for the customer and enhances production planning for Liberty. 
Advanced e-Commerce Capabilities - Over the last several years, Liberty has invested heavily in developing its e-commerce capabilities. In 2020, Liberty launched an enhanced LibertySafe.com website featuring AI-enhanced customer service, educational content, and 3D/augmented reality product experiences. Liberty has also helped many of its independent dealer partners develop their own websites and marketing strategies. Orders placed through LibertySafe.com and independent dealer sites represent a growing percentage of total sales, and Liberty leverages its established dealer network in order to fulfill online orders, a meaningful competitive advantage in a category featuring heavy products that are logistically difficult to deliver and install. Additionally, Liberty has devoted significant resources to its digital marketing initiatives, including search-engine optimization, building a leading social media presence, and maintaining high levels of consumer engagement through automated email campaigns.
Business Strategies
Liberty Safe has experienced strong historical growth while executing on multiple new sales and operational initiatives, positioning it to continue to increase its scale and improve profitability. Liberty’s growth strategy is rooted in the sales and marketing and operational initiatives that have spurred its expansion into new accounts and increased penetration of existing accounts. Liberty has significant opportunity in its existing channels to continue to build upon its already strong market share. In addition to growth within its current channels, Liberty’s core competencies can be successfully applied to ventures in the broader security equipment market. Potential near-to-medium term areas for expansion of Liberty’s platform include:
•Further penetrate existing National Retailer and Dealer Accounts by introducing new SKUs, enhancing its service offering and supporting the geographic expansion of certain Dealer Accounts
•Accelerate Liberty Safe’s e-commerce strategy through its newly-revamped website and capitalize on growing e-commerce sales through National and Dealer accounts
•Introduce new products and penetrate adjacent categories 
•Penetrate new channels and customer accounts including mass retailers, professional and residential 
•Pursue strategic acquisitions within the premium home and gun safe industry to enter new product categories and expand geographic footprint
Research and Development
Liberty Safe is the engineering and design leader in its sector, due to a history of first-to-market features and standard-setting design improvements. Liberty’s proactive solicitation of feedback and constant interaction with consumers and retail customers across diverse channels and geographies enables Liberty Safe to stay at the forefront of customer demands. Liberty’s approach to product development increases the likelihood of market acceptance by creating products that are more relevant to consumers’ demands. Research and development costs were $0.1 million in 2020, $0.8 million in 2019, and $0.2 million in 2018.
In addition to product enhancements, new products, such as the plate-door National Security Classic, and a new, 6-SKU line of handgun vaults were launched in 2015 from Liberty’s commitment to R&D. In 2016, Liberty introduced a new 3-section “Extreme” interior design, new safe covers, new handgun vault designs, and several new safe sizes.  In 2018, Liberty introduced a new flat pin design (patent pending) in all of its large safes.  This new design provides a much higher level of security against pry-attacks. In 2019, Liberty introduced a series of premium in-home vault doors.
Customers and Distribution Channels
Liberty Safe has fostered long-term relationships with leading national retailers (National or Non-Dealer) as well as numerous Dealers, enabling Liberty Safe to achieve considerable brand awareness and channel exposure. Through significant investment in its national accounts sales and marketing efforts, Liberty Safe has also become a leading supplier to National accounts. Expansion into National accounts is part of Liberty Safe’s strategy to reach a broader customer base and more varied demographics. National account customers include sporting goods retailers, farm and fleet retailers, and home improvement retailers. For the last three years, Liberty Safe had 20 Non-Dealer account customers that are estimated to have accounted for approximately 48%, 48% and 40% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Dealer customers include local hunting and fishing stores, hardware stores and numerous other local, independent store models. Dealer customers accounted for 52%, 52%, and 60% of net sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Liberty had over 450 dealer customers.
Liberty Safe’s two largest customers accounted for approximately 33%, 33% and 30% of net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Seasonality
Liberty Safe typically experiences its lowest earnings in the second quarter due to lower demand for safes at the onset of summer.
Sales and Marketing
Liberty Safe possesses robust sales and marketing capabilities in the safe industry. Liberty Safe utilizes separate sales teams for National accounts and Dealers, which enables it to provide more focused and effective strategies to manage and develop relationships within different channels. Liberty Safe has made significant recent investments in the development of a comprehensive sales and marketing program including merchandising, sales training and tools, promotions and supply chain management. Through these various initiatives, Liberty Safe offers highly adaptable programs to suit the varying needs of its retailers. This has enabled Liberty Safe to become a key supplier across diverse channels. Liberty largely focuses its marketing and advertising efforts on digital media as online markets have grown in importance. The team has invested significant time and resources to enhancing both LibertySafe.com and the individual sites of many of its dealer partners. 
Liberty is the clear category manager for many of its customers. The company’s Vendor Managed Inventory program provides support to Dealers and National Accounts by proactively managing inventory levels to reduce stockouts and increase return on inventory dollars. 
Competition
Liberty Safe is the premier brand in the premium home and gun safe industry. Liberty is in a class by itself when it comes to manufacturing technology and efficiency and supply chain capabilities. Competitors are generally more heavily focused on either smaller, sourced safes or large, domestically produced safes. Competitive domestic manufacturers run “blacksmith” type factories that are small, inefficient and require a tremendous amount of manual 
labor that produces inconsistent product. In addition, many of Liberty’s competitors are directly tied to a third-party brand, such as Browning or Winchester.
Liberty competes with other safe manufacturers based on price, breadth of product line, technology, product supply chain capabilities and marketing capabilities. Channel diversity in the premium home and gun safe industry is rare. Most companies have greater concentration in either the dealer channel or national accounts, but rarely having the supply chain capabilities or sales and marketing programs to service both channels effectively such as Liberty Safe does. Major competitors have limited sales and marketing departments and programs, making it difficult for them to expand sales and gain market share. Additionally, Liberty’s extensive Dealer network acts as a key fulfillment mechanism for online direct-to-consumer sales.

Marucci Sports
Overview
Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Marucci is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium wood and metal baseball bats, fielding gloves, batting gloves, bags, protective gear, sunglasses, on and off-field apparel, and other baseball and softball equipment used by professional and amateur athletes. Marucci also develops and licenses franchises for sports training facilities. Marucci products are available through owned websites, their team sales organization, Big Box Retailers, and third party e-commerce and resellers. In 2017, Marucci acquired Victus Sports, a King of Prussia, Pennsylvania based complementary baseball equipment manufacturer and distributor. We acquired Marucci in April 2020 for a purchase price of $201.0 million. Marucci has vertically integrated wood bat manufacturing and has built long-standing relationships with international suppliers who manufacture the remainder of their product lines.
Marucci is an established brand commanding strong market share across product categories. Marucci’s mission is to “honor the game” and brands itself as such with simplistic imagery, black and white color schemes, and to-the-point marketing campaigns.
Victus is a more recent entrant to the baseball equipment market but garners similar wood bat usage as Marucci. The brand is widely recognized for their edgy designs and big attitude. Victus’ mission, in contrast to Marucci’s, is to embrace the evolution of the game and to salute the next generation of players who set out to change it.
History of Marucci Sports
Marucci Sports was founded in 2009 by a team including two former professional baseball players. Marucci released its first metal bat, the Marucci CAT5, in 2009. In 2013, Marucci released batting gloves and launched their first series of fielding gloves, the Founders’ Series. Marucci was able to leverage its brand power to expand into the baseball apparel and accessories market as well. In 2018, Marucci acquired Carpenter Trade to expand the quality and technology of their fielding glove offering and change the current consumer expectations for a truly customized fielding glove. Victus’ product offering expanded into metal bats in 2019 with the launch of its Vandal line and recently expanded with the launch of the NOX. In 2019 Marucci also acquired two timber mills and a wood drying facility, securing vertical manufacturing capabilities within their wood bat product category and ensuring access to the best wood in the game.
Today, Marucci is a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium Marucci and Victus-branded baseball and softball equipment including wood and metal baseball bats, fielding gloves, batting gloves, bags, protective gear, sunglasses, on and off-field apparel, and other baseball and softball equipment. All of these products are sold around the world in retail stores, online and through its corporate owned and franchised training facilities.
Industry
Marucci Sports competes primarily in the domestic baseball equipment market which includes wood bats, metal bats, fielding gloves, cleats, protective and other gear, and uniforms/ team apparel and which management estimates constitutes approximately $1.3 billion of annual retail revenue. Marucci Sports also competes within the greater global baseball equipment market which management estimates constitutes approximately $2.2 billion of annual retail revenue. Marucci’s product offering targets primarily the premium equipment price point more often used in competitive club and travel leagues, for which participation rates are generally more stable.
The industry is generally considered to be a stable sector with growth rates in the low single digits. Baseball equipment is largely sold through national retailers. Independent resellers and online platforms also sell baseball equipment while the balance is purchased directly from the manufacturer.
Products 
Marucci designs, manufactures, and markets six categories of products: (i) metal bats, (ii) wood bats, (iii) apparel & accessories, (iv) batting gloves, (v) fielding gloves, and (vi) bags & protective equipment. Marucci’s product strategy encompasses producing high quality products recognized by consumers for their performance, craftsmanship, and value, and building on a rich history to introduce innovative new products. 
Metal Bats
Metal bats have historically represented Marucci’s largest product category by revenue. The metal bats are priced at the premium end of the market. Marucci produces metal bats for all ages, from college to tee ball, with a focus on elite high school players. The CAT series is the flagship metal bat product from Marucci. Marucci also offers a lower price point model, the F5. Victus’ first metal offering, the Vandal, was first launched in 2019, and is priced similarly to the CAT series. Victus later introduced its first two-piece bat in the NOX. Metal bats used in youth and elite travel leagues are subject to strict regulations limiting spring and exit velocity. All Marucci’s metal bats are compliant with respective amateur sport governing bodies. The company has historically followed a two-year product release cycle, and Marucci metal bats have notable staying power with their customer base as prior year models remain in production. 
Wood Bats
Marucci’s wood bats are built with quality, precision, and customization. Marucci prides itself in making every pro-bound bat a “game bat”. Marucci offers two types of wood bats: ash and maple. Ash is a soft, open grain wood. Maple bats are a much harder, closed grain wood and constitute a large majority of the company’s wood bat sales. 
The wide variety of selection and price points offer professional-level quality and cuts to amateur players as well. Innovative customization options further drive engagement. 
Apparel & Accessories
Marucci offers a full suite of apparel and accessory offerings that is rapidly expanding. The current product portfolio includes on-field and off-field apparel, sunglasses, hats, grips, and more. Most sales of these products are sold direct-to-team in custom apparel packages including baseball pants, jerseys, practice shirts, and more. Marucci has in-house screen-printing operations allowing for customization of various pieces of apparel.
Batting Gloves 
All Marucci batting gloves are designed to meet professional standards of comfort, durability and performance while also appealing to users of all levels. Marucci has four lines of batting gloves: Pittards’ Reserve, Signature, Quest, and Code while Victus has one, the Debut. Marucci also offers limited production customized batting gloves. Marucci’s batting gloves span the pricing spectrum. 
Fielding Gloves 
Marucci offers a growing set of fielding gloves across six product series: Capital, Cypress, Oxbow, Ascension, Vermillion, and Acadia. Marucci has a complete line of gloves to meet the needs of every position player at every age and skill level. Marucci offers gloves across the pricing spectrum. Marucci acquired Carpenter Trade in 2018, along with their C-Mod technology which provides a unique fit. 
Bags & Protective Gear 
Marucci offers an extensive line of bags and protective gear including bat packs, bat quivers, helmets, shin and elbow guards, catchers gear, and more allowing Marucci to cater to nearly all its customers playing needs.
Business Strategies
Continued Innovation in Existing Product Categories
Marucci plans to continue to build on its successful history of bringing new, highly anticipated products to market through leveraging its stringent new product development process, and external and internal manufacturing capabilities. The company has near-term new product launches and existing product updates planned across all categories.
Further Penetration of Existing Customer Accounts
Marucci has identified opportunities to leverage its existing relationships with retailers to drive expanded SKU offerings across categories, especially in apparel. Additionally, management believes the company can continue to improve Victus product adoption with existing channel partners. 
Approximately $150 million fielding glove market represents a significant growth opportunity for Marucci. Fielding gloves are the second largest hard goods market in baseball / softball. Marucci plans to leverage its brand strength and innovation to capture share in this high margin category. The acquisition of Carpenter Trade in 2018 has allowed Marucci to offer a highly customized glove that serves as a key differentiator in fielding gloves.
Victus Category and Product Expansion
Victus has strong penetration in the majors and key affiliations with top players. The brand released its first metal bat in 2019, the one-piece Victus Vandal BBCOR bat and later launched its first two-piece bat, the NOX. Metal bats sales are expected to meaningfully contribute to Victus’ overall sales in the future. Victus’ key affiliates and player advocacy has driven a halo effect across other categories. Growth in lifestyle and fan apparel represents a significant opportunity for Victus to leverage its brand. 
Increase in International Market Presence
International sales currently represent a small portion of total sales. Natural expansion opportunities exist in baseball markets abroad such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, and Latin America. Marucci has achieved profitable growth in Asia by leveraging its premium brands and accessing markets through proven team dealers and distributors.
Further Penetration of Softball Market
Marucci’s plans to leverage its brand strength in baseball to further penetrate the softball market. Marucci is driving brand awareness and growth in the softball market from the ground up through grassroots marketing efforts, and 
leveraging its partnerships with colleges and affiliated Marucci club teams, as well the recently launched softball mobile tour, to get in front of players of all ages. Marucci has dedicated employees who focus on softball expansion and have experience in the category as former collegiate athletes and coaches.
Expansion of the Direct-to-Team Sales Channel
The Direct-to-Team (“DTT”) sales channel allows Marucci to sell its equipment and apparel directly to thousands of players. Marucci currently has 29 Founders’ Club organizations, representing 15,000 players. Since launching DTT strategy in 2014, sales to this channel have increased rapidly. 
Marucci’s proprietary online platform for this channel, “Locker Room”, is ideal for any group that requires individual processing and purchasing. There is potential opportunity to leverage Locker Room capabilities across other team sports as the total market size for U.S. Team Sports Uniforms is approximately $1.3 billion. Marucci feels the DTT strategy is still in its early stages.
Industry Consolidation 
With a well-developed global supply chain, external and internal manufacturing capabilities, sophisticated management systems infrastructure, and extensive network of relevant relationships, Marucci is a platform for consolidation within both the baseball and softball equipment and apparel spaces. Management has identified a pipeline of potential acquisition targets that would help Marucci strengthen and expand its product offering and address new market segments. 
Customers and Distribution Channels
Marucci sells its products through several channels including Big Box Retailers; DTC, DTT, Clubhouse and other Owned Channels; and third-party e-commerce and resellers. Marucci’s top 5 customers accounted for .7% of 2020 of net sales.
Seasonality
Marucci typically has higher sales in the first quarter each year, ahead of the primary baseball season. However, management expects seasonality to smooth as baseball becomes an increasingly year-round sport. 
Competition
Marucci competes with offerings from multiple large baseball equipment manufacturers, including Easton (under the Easton and Rawlings brands) and Wilson Sporting Goods Company (under the Wilson, DeMarini, Louisville Slugger, and Evoshield brands), and numerous smaller wood bat specific brands including Old Hickory, Chandler Bats, Tucci, Dove Tail, Sam Bat, and D-Bat. Key determinants in consumer purchasing decisions include product performance, quality, and brand loyalty.
Suppliers
Marucci leverages a combination of sourcing and in-house manufacturing. Metal bats, apparel, batting gloves, fielding gloves, bags, and other accessories are sourced from an international network of primarily Asian manufacturing partners, while wood bats are manufactured domestically at the company’s Baton Rouge (Marucci) and King of Prussia (Victus) facilities. In 2019, the company acquired two timber mills, effectively consolidating its wood bat supply chain to improve quality and production efficiency and ensuring continued access to the best wood in the game.
Intellectual Property
Marucci maintains 51 trademarks in the U.S., 29 of which are registered and 22 of which are pending registration. Marucci also has 1 issued patent. Management considers its trademarked brand names, preeminent name recognition, ability to design innovative products, and technical and marketing expertise to be its primary competitive advantages.
Product Development
The product development cycle varies by product with bats taking approximately 16 months to reach distribution and batting gloves requiring approximately 9 months. New product development at Marucci occurs in six successive stages: (1) Identify Market Opportunity – search for player needs via internal leads, supplier partners, or on-the ground feedback from players in their network, (2) Cross Functional Ideation – host ongoing dialogue with sourcing 
partners to identify next-gen technology, (3) Product Development – have sourcing partners begin preliminary testing runs once viable new products are identified, (4) Production and Validation – continue rigorous prototyping and product validation on the field and in the Marucci performance lab, (5) Marketing – engage in-house marketing team to drive product naming, rollout, branding, and marketing stories to expand awareness, and (6) Product Rollout and Distribution – finalize the marketing story, conduct sales presentations, and provide samples to reps and finally receiving orders from channel partners and beginning full production. 
Regulatory Environment
Baseball and softball equipment, outside of bats, enjoys a largely restriction free Federal/Local government regulatory framework. Metal bats used in youth and elite travel leagues are subject to strict regulations limiting spring and exit velocity determined by self-regulatory associations connected to the sport. There are three key regulatory groups associated with baseball: USA Baseball, United States Specialty Sports Association (“USSSA”), and Bat-Ball Coefficient of Restitution (“BBCOR”). Each have their own method for measuring bat performance. BBCOR is the standard currently governing adult baseball bats used in High School and Collegiate play while USA and USSSA govern youth leagues. There are also regulatory bodies specific to softball including Amateur Softball Association (ASA) and Independent Softball Association, among others. Wood bats used in professional baseball are subject to league-specific regulations.
Human Capital
Marucci had 208 employees at December 31, 2020, 167 full-time and 41 part-time employees, all located in the United States. Marucci's labor force is non-union. Management believes that Marucci has a good relationship with its employees. 
Velocity Outdoor
Overview
Velocity Outdoor, headquartered in Bloomfield, New York, is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of airguns, archery products, laser aiming devices and related accessories. We acquired a majority interest in Velocity Outdoor for a net purchase price of $150.4 million in June 2017. Velocity Outdoor offers its products under the highly recognizable Crosman, Benjamin, LaserMax, Ravin and CenterPoint brands that are available through national retail chains, mass merchants, dealer and distributor networks. Airguns historically represent Velocity Outdoor's largest product category. The airgun product category consists of air rifles, air pistols and a range of accessories including targets, holsters and cases. Velocity Outdoor's other primary product categories are archery, with products including CenterPoint crossbows and the Pioneer Airbow, consumables, which includes steel and plastic BBs, lead pellets and CO2 cartridges, lasers for firearms, and airsoft products. In September 2018, Velocity acquired Ravin Crossbows, a manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology. 
History of Velocity Outdoor
Velocity was founded in 1923 as Crosman Rifle Company and was one of the first manufacturers of recreational airguns in the United States. Velocity Outdoor acquired Visible Impact Target Company in 1991 and Benjamin Sheridan Corporation in 1992. Benjamin was, and continues to be, a dominant U.S. producer of high-end pneumatic and CO2 powered airguns while Sheridan was one of the world’s foremost manufacturers of high-quality paintball markers. In 2007, Velocity expanded its offerings outside the traditional airgun category with the debut of its new optics division, CenterPoint Precision Optics. In 2008, Velocity diversified further by adding Crosman Archery to its list of branded products and introduced two new hunting crossbows in addition to youth archery products. In 2016, Velocity debuted its CenterPoint line of crossbows and the Benjamin Pioneer Airbow, the first ever mass-produced air powered archery device and with the 2018 acquisition of Ravin Crossbows, Velocity expanded their archery product line into the higher-end segment of the crossbow market. In 2017, Velocity acquired the commercial product line of LaserMax, a leading designer and manufacturer of gun-mounted laser aiming devices. 
Today, Velocity Outdoor is an international designer, manufacturer and marketer of Crosman and Benjamin airguns including related ammunition and accessories, archery products including the Ravin and CenterPoint crossbows, airsoft rifles, pistols, and ammunition, laser aiming devices, and precision optics. 
Industry
Velocity Outdoor primarily competes within the airgun and archery sub-segments of the broader outdoor recreational products industry, which together management estimates constitute approximately $1.1 billion of annual manufacturer revenue. Both categories share certain common characteristics, including consumer demand for innovation, similar sales channels, and unique regulatory frameworks. 
The airgun industry is estimated by management to constitute approximately $275 million of annual manufacturer revenue, including consumables and excluding accessories. With a history stretching back over a century, the industry is generally considered to be a mature sector, with stable growth rates in the low single digits. Airgun products are largely sold through big box specialty or sporting goods retailers and independent dealers, accounting for roughly 30% and 20% of purchases, respectively. Online platforms account for approximately 25% of purchases, with the remainder moving through mass merchants. Airguns are less seasonal than archery because there is no defined hunting season, although sales spike somewhat around holidays.
The archery equipment market is estimated by management to constitute approximately $770 million of annual manufacturers sales, of which $500-$550 million is attributable to bows and $200-$250 million is attributable to related archery consumables. Vertical and compound bows, and crossbows each comprise about half of the category sales, with crossbows gaining share in recent years. Big box outdoor retailers and independent archery dealers each accounting for approximately 25% of consumer purchases, while ecommerce has grown to hold a 20% share. Big box sporting goods stores and mass merchants make up the remainder of consumer sales.
Products and Services
Velocity designs, manufacturers and markets five categories of products: (i) airguns, (ii) archery products, (iii) consumables, or pellets, BBs and CO2 cartridges, (iv) optics, and (v) airsoft. Velocity's product strategy encompasses producing high quality, feature-rich products recognized by consumers for their craftsmanship and value, and building on a rich history to introduce innovative new products. 
Airguns
Airguns has historically represented Velocity's largest product category. The airgun product line consists of air rifles, air pistols and a range of accessories including targets, holsters and cases. Velocity's airguns are designed to be multi-purpose, multi-occasion products, for use in recreational plinking and target shooting, pest control, and hunting. Velocity offers a “good, better, best” array of airguns under the Crosman and Benjamin brands. The Crosman brand is known for high value at an accessible price, where the Benjamin brand is typically associated with premium products falling within the mid- to high-price point. Additionally, Velocity rounds out its offering with mid-level products produced under an exclusive licensing agreement with Remington for its Remington, Marlin, DPMS, and Bushmaster brands. 
Archery Products
Velocity re-entered the archery market in 2016 with a product line anchored by the CenterPoint crossbow and the first-of-its-kind Pioneer Airbow. CenterPoint has grown rapidly since it was launched to become the second largest player in the crossbow category. The CenterPoint Sniper 370 is the top-selling SKU in the crossbow market, with more than twice the volume of its nearest competitor. CenterPoint acquired market share by offering features like an aluminum frame, higher shooting velocity, integrated string stops, a 4x32mm scope and shoulder sling at very competitive retail prices.
Concurrent with the launch of the CenterPoint line of crossbows, Velocity also introduced the Pioneer Airbow. The Pioneer Airbow created a new sportsman category as the first ever mass-produced air-powered archery device, effectively bridging the gap between airguns and archery. Velocity acquired Ravin Crossbows in 2018, further expanding its product line in the archery market. Ravin Crossbows is a leading designer, manufacturer and innovator of crossbows and accessories. Ravin primarily focuses on the higher-end segment of the crossbow market and has developed significant intellectual property related to the advancement of crossbow technology.
Consumables
Velocity's consumables segment consists of steel and plastic BBs, various styles of lead pellets, and single-use CO2 cartridges used to power airguns. BBs are typically used for plinking, training, or target shooting at a more affordable cost, while different pellet styles are designed either for accuracy, maximum penetration, or a combination of the two. Velocity is the world’s largest provider and only domestic manufacturer of CO2 cartridges, 
having first introduced the use of C02 as an airgun propellant in 1961. Consumables are produced under the Crosman, Benjamin, and Copperhead brand names. 
Optics
Launched in 2006, Velocity's line of optics products offers high-performance, value-priced optics under the CenterPoint brand. The scopes, sights, binoculars, lights, and lasers are marketed for traditional firearms, in addition to select airgun and crossbow offerings. In 2017, Velocity added to their optics product line with the acquisition of the commercial division of LaserMax. LaserMax is a global leader in hardened and miniaturized laser systems, offering a comprehensive line of premium laser sights for home defense, personal protection and training use. LaserMax’s commercial business provides laser sighting solutions and tactical lights to the firearm original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and retail channels. Management believes that the addition of the LaserMax products enables Velocity to reach a wider range of new customers across retail channels. 
Airsoft
Airsoft guns are a class of air, CO2, gas, or electric-powered guns that are typically made from high-impact plastics and are engineered with recreation in mind to fire safe, plastic BBs quickly and accurately. Airsoft products are most often used for recreational purposes by a younger demographic and a strong user base amongst military and law enforcement customers. Velocity offers a broad portfolio of airsoft rifles and pistols under its owned Crosman Elite and Game Face brands, as well as the licensed U.S. Marines brand. 
Competitive Conditions
Airguns
Velocity's airgun line competes with offerings from several airgun manufacturers, including Daisy Outdoor Products, Gamo Outdoor USA (which acquired Daisy in July 2016 but remains separately branded), and Germany-based Umarex. The market for airguns is relatively concentrated, led by Crosman, Daisy, Gamo, and Umarex, according to Sports OneSource data. Key determinants in consumer purchasing decisions include product performance, quality, and brand loyalty.
Archery
The archery market competes within a “good, better, best” spectrum. Velocity's CenterPoint product line, as a value-for-price, entry to mid-level brand, tends to lie between the “good” and “better” segments, competing with Barnett Outdoors, Killer Instinct, and PSE Technologies, among others. Consumers tend to make purchasing decisions based on brand awareness, reliability, customer service, and pricing. Although CenterPoint is a recent entry into the archery market, the brand has been able to outpace more established brands on the reliability, pricing, and service aspects to win market share. The Ravin product line has a higher price point and falls within the "best" segment for crossbows, competing with the higher end Tenpoint crossbows. Ravin entered the market in 2017 and has since become the number one selling brand as measured by retail dollars.
Business Strategies
Continued Innovation in Existing Product Categories
Velocity plans to continue to build on its successful history of bringing new, technically superior products to market through leveraging its stringent new product development process, internal manufacturing capabilities, and a flexible supply chain. The company has near-term new product launches and existing product updates planned across all categories, including the highlights below. 
◦Airguns - Building on the Silencing Barrel Device (SBD) technology, Velocity is introducing a line of multi-shot break-barrel models that feature a 10-shot clip that advances automatically. Velocity is also enjoying success with its recent introduction of fast shooting full-auto BB guns under the Crosman brand. In addition, Velocity continues to be the world’s largest producer of BB, pellets and CO2 powerlets.
◦Archery - On the heels of the successful 2016 launch of the CenterPoint crossbow line, Velocity continues to offer the best value proposition in the industry. Recently CenterPoint has introduced new crossbow models at higher price points to segments of the market and Ravin continues to introduce models that lead the industry in 
innovation and performance. Ravin recently shocked the hunting world with the introduction of its new electric cocking/de-cocking model that shoots a whopping 500 feet per second. 
◦Optics - In addition to the launch of three CenterPoint Spectrum First Focal Plane series of scopes, the company recently released CenterPoint optics to include range finding binoculars and scope adapters. Additionally, following the launch of the grip activated GripSense lasers in 2017, Lasermax has introduced a universal rail mounted laser featuring the same activation technology.
◦Airsoft - Airsoft guns are a class of air, CO2, gas, or electric-powered guns that are typically made from high-impact plastics and are engineered with recreation in mind to fire safe, plastic BBs quickly and accurately. Airsoft products are most often used for recreational purposes by a younger demographic and a strong user base amongst military and law enforcement customers. Velocity offers a broad portfolio of airsoft rifles and pistols under its owned Game Face brand.
Expand into Adjacent Product Categories
Management believes that the company can leverage in-house manufacturing and sourcing partners to develop products in new categories that utilize Velocity's existing distribution network and brand strength. 
Further Penetration of Existing Customer Accounts
Management has identified several strategies for further penetrating its existing customer accounts. First, Velocity has identified opportunities to leverage its existing relationships with retailers to drive expanded SKU offerings across categories. Additionally, management believes the company can expand the CenterPoint brand into the dealer network due to the acquisition of Ravin. Furthermore, management believes that the company is well positioned to grow as its brick-and-mortar customers adapt to a changing retail landscape. Velocity can leverage its structured analytical sales approach and new marketing initiatives to assist retailers with enhancing their online sales, similar to the strategies it already employs working with pure e-commerce customers like Amazon and Pyramyd Air.
Consolidation Platform
With a well-developed global supply chain, refined manufacturing capabilities, sophisticated management systems infrastructure, and extensive network of relevant relationships, Velocity sees itself as a platform for consolidation within both the broader outdoor recreational goods space and the archery space specifically. Management has identified a pipeline of potential acquisition targets that would help Velocity strengthen and expand its product offering and address new market segments. 
International Growth
Velocity is exploring opportunities to grow international sales and increase market share by pursuing new international distributor relationships. Management has recently focused its efforts on key markets within Latin America. However, with a more fulsome archery product line in development, the Company is well positioned to expand into key international bowhunting markets such as Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
New Product Development
Velocity has developed a repeatable, structured product development process that integrates all areas of the business, including sales, marketing, engineering, purchasing, production and finance. New products must pass a 6-to-18 month stage gating process designed to ensure engineering and commercial viability. Once a product idea is identified, a five-phase step-by-step process is used to either (a) refine the idea into a producible, marketable good, or (b) identify contradicting data that may warrant the project being tabled or canceled altogether. A Product Development Committee must approve the advancement of a new product from one phase to the next. To balance the company’s new product pipeline, aging and underperforming SKUs are regularly culled. This intentional focus on constant innovation and consumer feedback has helped Velocity establish a portfolio of highly regarded brands across several product categories.
Customers
Velocity sells its products through nearly all major domestic mass merchants and sporting goods retailers and has established a strong e-commerce platform to allow for flexibility in a changing retail environment. The three largest 
customers represented 36.7% of gross sales in 2020 and represented the major sales channels; mass merchant, e-commerce, and regional retail.
Seasonality
Velocity typically has higher sales in the third and fourth quarter each year, reflecting the hunting and holiday seasons, respectively. 
Sales and Marketing
Velocity's products are sold through over 900 customers across a mix of sales channels, including mass merchants, national retailers, distributors/dealers/regional chains, international distributors, and e-commerce. Over the last 5 years, management has successfully diversified both its sales channel composition and customer mix.
Velocity sells its products through nearly all major domestic mass merchants and sporting goods retailers currently selling airguns and has established a strong e-commerce platform to allow for flexibility in a changing retail environment. The company has been selling to many of its customers for over 20 years, maintaining close relationships with key purchasing personnel through high-touch customer service. Velocity is one of the only players in the sportsman category offering category management services, product assortment, and SKU optimization feedback typical of larger multinational consumer products companies. This data-sharing has resulted in higher retailer sell-through and margin enhancement, more accurate sales forecasting, and a 98% fulfillment rate, all of which are key components in maintaining status as a vendor of choice. 
Velocity maintains an internal sales team responsible for covering the vast majority of its customer relationships, or approximately 90% of total sales. Furthermore, Velocity supplements its in-house team with four independent sales representative organizations, providing coverage for approximate 375 additional customers across their respective geographic territories. International sales efforts are handled by Velocity-employed account executives who work through local distributors in order to ensure that products conform to local regulatory standards.
Velocity had a backlog of $39.0 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Manufacturing and Distribution Channels
Velocity's product manufacturing is based on a dual strategy of in-house manufacturing and strategic alliances with select sub-contractors and vendors. Velocity conducts its domestic manufacturing operations in two locations. The first is a 225,000 square foot facility on a company-owned 49-acre campus located in East Bloomfield, New York, approximately 30 miles southeast of Rochester. The second is an 85,000 square foot leased facility in Superior, Wisconsin. In addition, the company utilizes approximately 144,000 square feet of leased warehouse space in nearby Farmington, New York, five miles from the East Bloomfield facility. 
Intellectual Property
Velocity Outdoor currently holds a global portfolio of more than 100 registered trademarks and a global patent portfolio of more than 50 issued patents with many more pending. Management considers its patent holdings, trademarked brand names, preeminent name recognition, ability to design innovative products, and technical and marketing expertise to be its primary competitive advantages.
Regulatory Environment
Airguns
Airguns enjoy a relatively unrestrictive federal regulatory framework, with most regulations determined at the state level. Although there are no federal laws regulating their transfer, possession or use, non-powder guns are subject to oversight from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CSPC”). Therefore, airguns are subject to generalized statutory limitations involving “substantial product hazard” and articles that pose a substantial risk of injury to children, though the CSPC has not adopted specific mandatory regulations in this area. Federal law prevents states from prohibiting the sale of airguns but allows for state-by-state restrictions on sales of airguns to minors. Thirteen states have imposed such restrictions. Historically, there have not been attempts to grandfather the regulation of airguns into that of traditional powdered firearms, as legislative efforts have largely focused on responding to and refining the existing regulatory framework for each respective category rather than overhauling the coordination or transfer of enforcement duties across agencies.
Archery
Crossbow hunting restrictions have become less stringent over the last several years. Since 2006, 12 states, including populous hunting states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, have legalized crossbow hunting, while many others moved to relax restrictions through the opening of limited seasons or creation of exceptions to hunting restrictions for those with disabilities. Today, only Oregon classifies crossbows as illegal but there is currently a proposal to allow crossbows during the all-weapon deer season in the eastern half of the state. Nearly 90% of all hunting permits are filed in states that currently allow crossbow hunting for at least part of the season. Although continued deregulation is expected, it likely will not be the largest driver for the crossbow category moving forward. Participation levels have steadily increased within the states. This will continue to be the main driver behind market growth moving forward.
Human Capital
Velocity had 367 employees on December 31, 2020, 341 full-time employees and 26 part-time employees, with 366 employees located within the United States. Velocity’s labor force is non-union. Management believes that Velocity has an excellent relationship with its employees.

Advanced Circuits meets this market need by manufacturing and delivering custom PCBs in as little as 24 hours, providing customers with over 98% error-free production and real-time customer service and product tracking 24 hours per day. 
History of Advanced Circuits
Advanced Circuits commenced operations in 1989 through the acquisition of a small Denver-based PCB manufacturer. During its first years of operations, Advanced Circuits focused exclusively on manufacturing high volume, production run PCBs with a small group of proportionately large customers. After the loss of a significant customer in the early 1990s, Advanced Circuits began focusing on developing a diverse customer base, and in particular, on meeting the demands of equipment manufacturers with low-volume, high-margin, customized small-run and quick-turn PCBs.
We purchased a controlling interest in Advanced Circuits on May 16, 2006. Since our acquisition, Advanced Circuits has completed several add-on acquisitions that expanded their customer base in various industries and sectors, including the aerospace and defense industry and the long-lead sector. Over 50% of Advanced Circuits’ sales are derived from highly profitable small-run and quick-turn production PCBs. Advanced Circuits’ success is demonstrated by its broad base of over 11,000 customers that it does business with throughout the year.
Industry
The PCB industry, which consists of both large global PCB manufacturers and small regional PCB manufacturers, is a vital component to all electronic equipment supply chains, as PCBs serve as the foundation for virtually all electronic products, including cellular telephones, appliances, personal computers, routers, switches and network servers. PCBs are used by manufacturers of these types of electronic products, as well as by persons and teams engaged in research and development of new types of equipment and technologies.
Several significant trends are present within the PCB manufacturing industry. Production of PCBs in North America has declined in recent years due to increased competition for volume production of PCBs from Asian competitors benefiting from both lower labor costs and less restrictive waste and environmental regulations. Asian based manufacturers of PCBs are capitalizing on their lower labor costs and increasing their market share of volume production PCBs, which are used in high volume consumer electronics application such as computers and cell 
phones. This “offshoring” of high-volume production orders has placed increased pricing pressure and margin compression on many small domestic manufacturers that are no longer operating at full capacity. Many of these small producers are choosing to cease operations, rather than operate at a loss, as their scale, plant design and customer relationships do not allow them to focus profitably on the small-run and quick-turn sectors of the market. While Asian manufacturers have made large market share gains in the PCB industry overall, small-run and quick-turn production, some of the more complex volume production, and military production have remained strong in the United States. Rapid advances in technology are significantly shortening product life-cycles and placing increased pressure on original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to develop new products in shorter periods of time. In response to these pressures, OEMs invest heavily in research and development, which results in a demand for PCB companies that can offer engineering support and quick-turn production services to minimize the product development process. Additionally, increased complexity of electronic equipment requires maintaining the production infrastructure necessary to manufacture PCBs of increasing complexity. This often requires significant capital expenditures and has acted to reduce the competitiveness of local and regional PCB manufacturers lacking the scale to make such investments.
Both globally and domestically, the PCB market can be separated into three categories based on required lead time and order volume:
•Small-run PCBs — These PCBs are typically manufactured for customers in research and development departments of OEMs and academic institutions. Small-run PCBs are manufactured to the specifications of the customer, within certain manufacturing guidelines designed to increase speed and reduce production costs. Prototyping is a critical stage in the research and development of new products. These small-runs are used in the design and launch of new electronic equipment and are typically ordered in volumes of 1 to 50 PCBs. Because the small-run is used primarily in the research and development phase of a new electronic product, the life cycle is relatively short and requires accelerated delivery time frames of usually less than five days and very high, error-free quality. Order, production and delivery time, as well as responsiveness with respect to each, are key factors for customers as PCBs are indispensable to their research and development activities.
•Quick-Turn Production PCBs — These PCBs are used for intermediate stages of testing for new products prior to full scale production. After a new product has successfully completed the small-run phase, customers undergo test marketing and other technical testing. This stage requires production of larger quantities of PCBs in a short period of time, generally 10 days or less, while it does not yet require high production volumes. This transition stage between low-volume small-run production and volume production is known as quick-turn production. Manufacturing specifications conform strictly to end product requirements and order quantities are typically in volumes of 10 to 500. Similar to small-run PCBs, response time remains crucial as the delivery of quick-turn PCBs can be a gating item in the development of electronic products. Orders for quick-turn production PCBs conform specifically to the customer’s exact end product requirements.
•Volume Production PCBs — These PCBs, which we sometimes refer to as “long lead” and “sub-contract” are used in the full scale production of electronic equipment and specifications conform strictly to end product requirements. Volume Production PCBs are ordered in large quantities, usually over 100 units, and response time is less important, ranging between 15 days to 10 weeks or more.
These categories can be further distinguished based on board complexity, with each portion facing different competitive threats. Advanced Circuits competes largely in the small-run and quick-turn production portions of the North American market, which have not been significantly impacted by Asian-based manufacturers due to the quick response time required for these products. Management believes the North American PCB market was estimated to be approximately $3.6 billion in 2020.
Products and Services
A PCB is comprised of layers of laminate and contains patterns of electrical circuitry to connect electronic components. Advanced Circuits typically manufactures 2 to 20 layer PCBs, and has the capability to manufacture even higher layer PCBs. The level of PCB complexity is determined by several characteristics, including size, layer count, density (line width and spacing), materials and functionality. Beyond complexity, a PCB’s unit cost is determined by the quantity of identical units ordered, as engineering and production setup costs per unit decrease with order volume, and required production time, as longer times often allow increased efficiencies and better production management. Advanced Circuits primarily manufactures lower complexity PCBs.
Advanced Circuits assists its customers throughout the life-cycle of their products, from product conception through volume production. Advanced Circuits works closely with customers throughout each phase of the PCB development process, beginning with the PCB design verification stage using its unique online FreeDFM.com tool, FreeDFM.com™, which enables customers to receive a free manufacturability assessment report within minutes, resolving design problems that would prohibit manufacturability before the order process is completed and manufacturing begins. The combination of Advanced Circuits’ user-friendly website and its design verification tool reduces the amount of human labor involved in the manufacture of each order as PCBs move from Advanced Circuits’ website directly to its computer numerical control, or CNC, machines for production, saving Advanced Circuits and customers cost and time. As a result of its ability to rapidly and reliably respond to the critical customer requirements, Advanced Circuits receives a premium for their small-run and quick-turn PCBs as compared to volume production PCBs.
Advanced Circuits manufactures all high margin small-runs and quick-turn orders internally and occasionally utilizes external partners to manufacture production orders that do not fit within its capabilities or capacity constraints at a given time. As a result, Advanced Circuits constantly adjusts the portion of volume production PCBs produced internally to both maximize profitability and ensure that internal capacity is fully utilized.
The following table shows Advanced Circuits’ gross revenue by products and services for the periods indicated:

Competitive Strengths
Advanced Circuits has established itself as a leading provider of small-run and quick-turn PCBs in North America and focuses on satisfying customer demand for on-time delivery of high-quality PCBs. Advanced Circuits’ management believes the following factors differentiate it from many industry competitors:
•Numerous Unique Orders Per Day — Advanced Circuits receives on average over 300 customer orders per day. Due to the large quantity of orders received, Advanced Circuits is able to combine multiple orders in a single panel design prior to production. Through this process, Advanced Circuits is able to reduce the number of costly, labor intensive equipment set-ups required to complete several manufacturing orders. As labor represents the single largest cost of production, management believes this capability gives Advanced Circuits a unique advantage over other industry participants. 
•Diverse Customer Base — Advanced Circuits possesses a customer base with little industry or customer concentration exposure. For each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no customer represented more than 6% of net sales.
•Highly Responsive Culture and Organization — A key strength of Advanced Circuits is its ability to quickly respond to customer orders and complete the production process. In contrast to many competitors that require a day or more to offer price quotes on small-run or quick-turn production, Advanced Circuits offers its customers quotes within seconds and the ability to place or track orders any time of day. In addition, Advanced Circuits’ production facility operates three shifts per day and is able to ship a customer’s product within 24 hours of receiving its order.
•Proprietary FreeDFM.comTM Software — Advanced Circuits offers its customers unique design verification services through its online FreeDFM.com tool. This tool enables customers to receive a free manufacturability assessment report, within minutes, resolving design problems before customers place their orders. The service is relied upon by many of Advanced Circuits’ customers to reduce design errors and minimize production costs. Beyond improved customer service, FreeDFM.comTM has the added benefit of improving the efficiency of Advanced Circuits’ engineers, as many routine design problems, which 
typically require an engineer’s time and attention to identify, are identified and sent back to customers automatically.
•Established Partner Network — Advanced Circuits has established third party production relationships with PCB manufacturers in North America and Asia. Through these relationships, Advanced Circuits is able to offer its customers a complete suite of products including those outside of its core production capabilities. Additionally, these relationships allow Advanced Circuits to outsource orders for volume production and focus internal capacity on higher margin, short lead time, production and quick-turn manufacturing.
Business Strategies
Advanced Circuits’ management is focused on strategies to increase market share and further improve operating efficiencies. The following is a discussion of these strategies:
Increase Portion of Revenue from Small-run and Quick-Turn Production — Advanced Circuits’ management believes it can grow revenues and cash flow by continuing to leverage its core small-run and quick-turn capabilities. Over its history, Advanced Circuits has developed a suite of capabilities that management believes allow it to offer a combination of price and customer service unequaled in the market. Advanced Circuits intends to leverage this factor, as well as its core skill set, to increase net sales derived from higher margin small-run and quick-turn production PCBs. 
Acquire Customers from Local and Regional Competitors — Advanced Circuits’ management believes the majority of its competition for small-run and quick-turn PCB orders comes from smaller scale local and regional PCB manufacturers. Advanced Circuits continues to enter into small-run and quick-turn manufacturing relationships with several subscale local and regional PCB manufacturers. Management believes that while many of these manufacturers maintain strong, long-standing customer relationships, they are unable to produce PCBs with short turn-around times at competitive prices. As a result, Advanced Circuits sees an opportunity for growth by providing production support to these manufacturers or direct support to the customers of these manufacturers, whereby the manufacturers act more as a broker for the relationship.
Remain Committed to Customers and Employees — Advanced Circuits has remained focused on providing the highest quality products and services to its customers. Management believes this focus has allowed Advanced Circuits to achieve its outstanding delivery and quality record. Advanced Circuits’ management believes this reputation is a key competitive differentiator and is focused on maintaining and building upon it. Similarly, management believes its committed base of employees is a key differentiating factor. Management believes that Advanced Circuits’ emphasis on sharing rewards and creating a positive work environment has led to increased loyalty. Advanced Circuits plans to continue to focus on similar programs to maintain this competitive advantage.
Opportunistically Acquire Smaller PCB Manufacturers — Historically, Advanced Circuits has selectively made tuck-in acquisitions of regional PCB manufacturers. Management will continue to seek tuck-in acquisitions of smaller PCB manufacturers where sales and operational efficiencies can be realized, or strategic technical capabilities expanded.
Manufacturing Facility Enhancement - In 2019, Advanced Circuits built out a new state-of-the-art printed circuit board manufacturing facility that will allow it to provide existing and new customers with enhanced capabilities. 
Research and Development
Advanced Circuits engages in continual research and development activities in the ordinary course of business to update or strengthen its order processing, production and delivery systems. By engaging in these activities, Advanced Circuits expects to maintain and build upon the competitive strengths from which it benefits currently. Research and development expenses were not material in each of the last three years.
Customers and Distribution Channels
Advanced Circuits’ focus on customer service and product quality has resulted in a broad base of customers in a variety of end markets, including industrial, consumer, telecommunications, aerospace/defense, biotechnology and electronics manufacturing. These customers range in size from large, blue-chip manufacturers to small, not-for-profit university engineering departments. The following table sets forth management’s estimate of Advanced Circuits’ approximate customer breakdown by industry sector for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

 | Customer Distribution | 
Industry Sector | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Electronics Manufacturing Services | 20 | % | | 23 | % | 21 | %
Electrical Equipment and Components | 20 | % | | 20 | % | 25 | %
Industrial and Commercial Machinery | 20 | % | | 18 | % | 16 | %
Educational Institutions | 8 | % | | 8 | % | 12 | %
Transportation Equipment | 5 | % | | 5 | % | 7 | %
Measuring Instruments | 3 | % | | 5 | % | 3 | %
Engineer Services | 2 | % | | 4 | % | 2 | %
Business Services | 1 | % | | 1 | % | 1 | %
Wholesale Trade-Durable Goods | 1 | % | | 1 | % | 1 | %
All Other Sectors Combined | 20 | % | | 15 | % | 12 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Management estimates that over 75% of its orders are generated from existing customers. Moreover, more than half of Advanced Circuits’ orders in each of the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were delivered within five days (not including long-lead orders). In a typical year, no single customer represents more than 5% of Advanced Circuits’ sales.
Sales and Marketing
Advanced Circuits has established a “customer centric” marketing strategy to both acquire new customers and retain existing customers. Advanced Circuits uses advanced digital marketing techniques such as search engine optimization, pay-per-click, content marketing, segmented email marketing, social media marketing, web banners and behavioral retargeting. In addition to digital marketing Advanced Circuits runs aggressive pricing promotions and proactive outbound calling sales campaigns. Advanced Circuits spends approximately 1% of net sales each year on its marketing initiatives and advertising and has inside and outside sales professionals organized geographically throughout North America dedicated to its marketing and sales efforts. The sales team takes a systematic approach to placing sales calls and receiving inquiries and, on average, will place over 200 outbound sales calls and receive approximately 140 inbound phone inquiries per day. Beyond proactive customer acquisition initiatives, management believes a substantial portion of new customers are acquired through referrals from existing customers. In addition, other customers are acquired online where Advanced Circuits generates over 60% of its orders from its website. Substantially all revenue is derived from sales within the United States. 
Advanced Circuits, due to the volume of small-run and quick turn sales, had a negligible amount in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Competition
There are currently an estimated 160 active domestic PCB manufacturers. Advanced Circuits’ competitors differ amongst its products and services.
Competitors in the small-run and quick-turn PCBs production industry include larger companies as well as small domestic manufacturers. The largest independent domestic small-run and quick-turn PCB manufacturer in North America is TTM Technologies, Inc. Though this company produces small-run PCBs to varying degrees, in many ways it is not a direct competitor with Advanced Circuits. In recent years, larger competitors have primarily focused on producing boards with greater complexity in response to the offshoring of low and medium layer count technology to Asia. Compared to Advanced Circuits, small-run and quick-turn PCB production accounts for much smaller portions of larger competitors' revenues. Further, these competitors often have much greater customer concentrations and a greater portion of sales through large electronics manufacturing services intermediaries. Beyond large, public companies, Advanced Circuits’ competitors include numerous small local and regional manufacturers, often with revenues under $20 million. These smaller competitors have long-term customer relationships and typically produce both small-run and quick-turn PCBs and production PCBs for small OEMs and EMS companies. The competitive factors in small-run and quick-turn production PCBs are response time, quality, error-free production and customer service. Competitors in the long lead-time production PCBs generally include large companies, including Asian manufacturers, where price is the key competitive factor.
New market entrants into small-run and quick-turn production PCBs confront substantial barriers including significant investments in equipment, securing a highly skilled workforce with extensive engineering knowledge and compliance with environmental regulations. Beyond these tangible barriers, Advanced Circuits’ management believes that its network of customers, established over the last two decades, would be very difficult for a competitor to replicate.
Suppliers
Advanced Circuits’ raw materials inventory is small relative to sales and must be regularly and rapidly replenished. Advanced Circuits uses a just-in-time procurement practice to maintain raw materials inventory at low levels. Additionally, Advanced Circuits has established consignment relationships with several vendors allowing it to pay for raw materials as used. Because it provides primarily lower-volume quick-turn services, this inventory policy does not hamper its ability to complete customer orders. Raw material costs constituted approximately 24%, 24% and 23% of net sales for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The primary raw materials that are used in production are core materials, such as copper clad layers of glass and chemical solutions, and copper and gold for plating operations, photographic film and carbide drill bits. Multiple suppliers and sources exist for all materials. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and Advanced Circuits’ management believes this will continue in the foreseeable future. Advanced Circuits works closely with its suppliers to incorporate technological advances in the raw materials they purchase. Advanced Circuits does not believe that it has significant exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices. The fact that price is not the primary factor affecting the purchase decision of many of Advanced Circuits’ customers has allowed management to historically pass along a portion of raw material price increases to its customers. Advanced Circuits does not knowingly purchase material originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries.
Intellectual Property
Advanced Circuits seeks to protect certain proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with its employees, consultants and customers, as needed, and generally limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information and processes. Advanced Circuits’ management does not believe that patents are critical to protecting Advanced Circuits’ core intellectual property, but, rather, its effective and quick execution of fabrication techniques, its website FreeDFM.com™ and its highly skilled workforce are the primary factors in maintaining its competitive position.
Advanced Circuits uses the following brand names: FreeDFM.com™, 4pcb.com™, 4PCB.com™, 33each.com™, barebonespcb.com™ and Advanced Circuits™. These trade names have strong brand equity and are material to Advanced Circuits’ business.
Regulatory Environment
Advanced Circuits’ manufacturing operations and facilities are subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These include laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous substances. Management believes that Advanced Circuits is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. New requirements, more stringent application of existing requirements, or discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions may result in material environmental expenditures in the future. Advanced Circuits has been recognized multiple times for exemplary environmental compliance and has been consistently awarded the Denver Metro Wastewater Reclamation District Gold Award.
Human Capital
Advanced Circuits had 463 employees at December 31, 2020 operating out of three production facilities in the United States. Advanced Circuits believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.

Arnold operates 10 manufacturing facilities worldwide but functions as one company and one team. The facilities are split under the three business units shown above along with prototyping and advanced technology development through its Technology Center Located in Madison, Wisconsin.
History of Arnold
Arnold was founded in 1895 as the Arnold Electric Power Station Company. Arnold began producing AlNiCo permanent magnets in its Marengo, Illinois facility in the mid-1930s. In 1946, Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation (Allegheny) purchased Arnold, and over the next few years began production of several additional magnetic product lines under license agreement with the Western Electric Company. In 1970, Arnold acquired Ogallala Electronics, which manufactured high power coils and electromagnets.
SPS Technologies (SPS), at the time a publicly traded company, purchased Arnold Engineering Company from Allegheny in 1986. Under SPS, Arnold made a series of acquisitions and partnerships to expand its portfolio and geographic reach. In 2003, Precision Castparts, also a publicly traded company, acquired SPS. In January 2005, Audax, a Boston-based private equity firm acquired Arnold from Precision Castparts.
In February 2007, Arnold Magnetic Technologies completed the acquisition of Precision Magnetics, which expanded its geographic footprint to include operations in Sheffield, England and Lupfig, Switzerland.  In addition, Arnold’s Lupfig, Switzerland operation is a joint venture partner with a Chinese rare earth producer. The joint venture manufactures RECOMA® Samarium Cobalt blocks for select markets.
In 2016, Arnold developed and launched the world’s strongest Samarium Cobalt magnet grade, RECOMA 35E, that enables significant opportunity for increased performance in smaller packages, and at higher temperatures, with no trade off in stability. 
Through 2018 and 2019, Arnold deployed more advanced material from its PTM group such as Arnon 2 and 4 gauge electrical steels along with advanced performance molypermalloy metals. Advancements from the PMAG group during this same timeframe were targeted at magnet retention in high performance applications. The result of this hard work was the development of Carbon Fiber sleeving capabilities at its Sheffield UK facility. Lastly, Flexmag also introduced customized highly loaded composite materials for a variety of applications. 
We purchased a majority interest in Arnold on March 5, 2012. With the support of CODI, Arnold has made significant investment to support future growth strategies. 
Industry
Permanent Magnets
There exists a broad range of permanent magnets which include Rare Earth Magnets and magnets made from specialty magnetic alloys. Magnets produced from these materials may be sliced, ground, coated and magnetized to customer requirements. Those industry players with the broadest portfolio of these magnets, such as Arnold, 
maintain a significant competitive advantage over competitors as they are able to offer one-stop shop capabilities to customers. Management believes that being a manufacturer of these magnets, subject to patent rights, is another critical market advantage.
Magnetic Assemblies- Arnold offers complex, customized value added magnetic assemblies. These assemblies are used in devices such as motors, generators, beam focusing arrays, sensors, and solenoid actuators. Magnetic assembly production capabilities include machined metal components, magnet fabrication, machining, encapsulation or sleeving, balancing, and field mapping.

•Linear positioning Hall effect sensor systems
Rare Earth Magnets
•Samarium Cobalt (SmCo) - SmCo magnets are typically used in critical applications that require corrosion resistance or high temperature stability, such as motors, generators, actuators and sensors. Arnold markets its SmCo magnets under the trade name of RECOMA ®, and is DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation) compliant.
•Neodymium (Neo) - Neo magnets offer the highest magnetic energy level of any material in the market. Applications include motors and generators, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic inspection systems, sensors and loudspeakers.
Other Permanent Magnet Types
•AlNiCo - The AlNiCo family of magnets remains a preferred material for many mission critical applications. Its favorable linear temperature characteristics, high magnetic flux density and good corrosion resistance 
are ideally suited for use in applications requiring magnetic stability. This material is manufactured by Arnold in the United States, making it a DFARS compliant material.
•Hard Ferrite - Hard ferrite (ceramic) magnets were developed as a low cost alternative to metallic magnets (steel and AlNiCo). Although they exhibit lower energy when compared to other materials available today and are relatively brittle, ferrite magnets have gained acceptance due to their low price per magnetic output.
•Injection Molded - Injection molded magnets are a composite of various types of resin and magnetic powders. The physical and magnetic properties of the product depend on the raw materials, but are generally lower in magnetic strength and resemble plastics in their physical properties. However, a major benefit of the injection molding process is that magnet material can be injection or over-molded, eliminating subsequent manufacturing steps.

Competitive Strengths
Competitive Landscape
The specialty magnetic systems industry is highly fragmented, creating a competitive landscape with a variety of magnetic component manufacturers. However, few have the breadth of capabilities that Arnold possesses. Manufacturers compete on the basis of technical innovation, co-development capabilities, time-to-market, quality, geographic reach and total cost of ownership. Industry competitors relevant to Arnold’s served markets range from large multinational manufacturers to small, regional participants. Given these dynamics, we believe the industry will likely favor players that are able to achieve vertical integration and a diversification of offerings across a breadth of 
products along with magnet engineering and design expertise. The focus will be engineering solutions together with its customers. 
Barriers to Entry
•Low Substitution Risk – Arnold’s solutions are typically specified into its customers’ program designs through a co-development and qualification process that often takes 6-18 months. Arnold’s customers are typically contractors and component manufacturers whose products are integrated into end-customers’ applications. The high cost of failure, relatively low proportionate cost of magnets to the final product, sometimes lengthy testing and qualification process, and substantial upfront co-engineering investment required, represent significant barriers to customers changing solution providers such as Arnold.
•Equipment and Processing – Arnold’s existing base of production equipment has a significant estimated replacement cost. A new entrant could require as much as 2-3 years of lead time to match the process performance requirements, customization of equipment and material formulations necessary to effectively compete in the specialty magnet industry. Further, given the program nature of a majority Arnold’s sales, management estimates that it could take 5-10 years to build a sufficient book of business and base of institutional knowledge to generate positive cash flow out of a new manufacturing plant.

Foam Fabricators
Overview
Foam Fabricators, headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, is a designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components made from expanded polystyrene (EPS) and other expanded polymers. Foam Fabricators provides products to a variety of end-markets, including appliances and electronics, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness, grocery, automotive, building products and others. Foam Fabricators’ molded foam solutions offer shock and vibration protection, surface protection, temperature control, resistance to water absorption and vapor transmission and other protective properties critical for shipping small, delicate items, heavy equipment or temperature-sensitive goods. Foam Fabricators operates 14 molding and fabricating facilities across North America, creating a geographic footprint of strategically located manufacturing plants to efficiently serve national customer accounts.
History of Foam Fabricators
Foam Fabricators was founded in 1957 and began its operations as a single plant in St. Louis, MO, dedicated to the manufacture of rigid foam plastics. In 1959, Foam Fabricators expanded its product range to include ice chests, packaging and swim toys. In the 1970s and 1980s, Foam Fabricators expanded its geographic footprint, adding six more shape molding plants. In 1983, Texstyrene Plastics, a publicly-traded competitor and manufacturer of polystyrene products, acquired Foam Fabricators. Shortly thereafter, Foam Fabricators added three new plants to its operation.
In 1989, Texstyrene split off its various business divisions and sold Foam Fabricators to the then current management team of Texstyrene. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, Foam Fabricators grew partially through acquisitions purchasing four competitors. Foam Fabricators also opened two greenfield plants in Mexico to better serve their multinational manufacturing customers. In July 2020, Foam Fabricators acquired the assets of Polyfoam, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of protective and temperature-sensitive packaging solutions for the medical, 
pharmaceutical, grocery and food industries, among others. Today, Foam Fabricators operates out of its corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona and 14 manufacturing facilities across North America. 
We purchased Foam Fabricators on February 15, 2018.
Industry
Foam Fabricators competes in the broadly defined global protective packaging market which was valued at $23.5 billion in 2017. On the basis of product type, this market is segmented into rigid protective, flexible protective, and foam protective applications. Foam Fabricators primarily competes in the North American foam protective packaging market which was valued at $6.2 billion in 2017 and includes expanded polyurethane foams, loose fills, foam in place polyurethane, and molded foams products. Producers of molded foam products generally fall into two categories: block molders and shape molders. Block molders manufacture large blocks of EPS foam that are typically used as insulation in building products such as walls, roofs and floors and are closely tied to the construction market. Shape molders, such as Foam Fabricators, manufacture customized molded foam solutions for protective packaging applications, insulated shipping containers and internal parts and components for OEMs. Products made of EPS foam have broad applications across various end markets due to a unique combination of performance characteristics. The superior cushioning and barrier properties paired with insulating and hydrophobic properties make it an ideal material for protective packaging of heavy or valuable goods as well as insulated shipping containers for temperature and moisture sensitive products. 
Products and Services
Foam Fabricators designs and manufactures a broad array of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components serving various end markets. Foam Fabricators’ molded foam products are predominately made of expandable polystyrene (EPS), which is a rigid, closed-cell foam. EPS is comprised of polystyrene, a thermoplastic derived from the styrene monomer and benzene, and an added expansion agent, usually pentane. The final shape mold finished product is 98% air and is created in a low-pressure press which heats EPS beads that expand and fill a customer-specific mold. Foam Fabricators also uses other moldable materials including expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE) depending on project and customer requirements. EPS foam is an environmentally friendly material that is fully recyclable, uses less energy to produce, generates fewer emissions and has less environmental impact than most competitive material options.
Foam Fabricators’ custom-engineered molded foam products fall into four major categories: protective packaging, insulated shipping containers, OEM parts and componentry and fabricated foam. These products are used across a variety of end markets including consumer electronics, appliances, temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and food, automotive, home and office furnishings and building products among others. 
Protective Packaging - Foam Fabricators creates custom molded corner pads, edge pads, “clear-view” packages and other protective foam packaging solutions for durable goods such as large and counter-top appliances, furniture, consumer electronics and military applications. Molded foam is an ideal protective packaging choice because it can be shaped into almost any form at tight tolerances and provides lightweight yet strong cushioning during product shipment. 
Insulated Shipping Containers - Transporting healthcare and pharmaceutical products requires complex logistical processes, specific equipment, storage facilities and special handling procedures to maintain product integrity. These requirements make EPS foam an ideal material to be used in insulated shipping containers due to its thermal insulation, water impermeability and shock absorbing properties. Similar to its uses in the healthcare industry, Foam Fabricators manufactures insulated shipping containers for online grocers and meal delivery services to transport prepared meals and perishable food and beverage products that must be shipped in a temperature-controlled environment. 
OEM Parts and Componentry - Foam Fabricators manufactures a variety of internal components used by OEMs as replacements for injection molded plastic or sheet metal parts across various end-markets. Compared to traditional plastic parts, foam offers vibration protection, insulation benefits, lower tooling costs and shorter lead times. Foam Fabricators offers thin-wall molded air ducts and other internal components for household appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners. In the automotive sector, Foam Fabricators manufactures foam door panels, trunk liners, bumper components, instrument panels, center consoles, side pillars, seat components and head rests. Foam is increasingly being used in new vehicle designs because it offers equivalent impact strength and toughness to traditional chassis materials with 10 to 40% less weight. Foam Fabricators also makes products used 
in personal watercraft floatation and seating parts as well as recreational vehicle roof panels and core laminates that go underneath aluminum outer skins. Lastly, Foam Fabricators produces building products for the construction market including insulated concrete forms. Insulated concrete forms are hollow sections of molded foam that construction crews stack into the shape of the walls of a building and fill with concrete to create the permanent structure.
Fabricated Foam - Foam Fabricators also uses a variety of methods including die cutting, saw cutting, hot wire slicing and pressure cutting to create fabricated foam shapes as opposed to molded shapes. These products do not require tooling or dies so there is less upfront costs for the customer and are usually best suited for medium to low volume projects. Fabricated foam products represent a small portion of Foam Fabricators overall net sales.
Competitive Strengths
National Scale and Proximity to Customers - Foam Fabricators maintains a national footprint of 14 manufacturing locations across North America. Facilities are strategically located near customers’ production locations enabling Foam Fabricators to be one of only a few foam molders capable of serving large national accounts. Due to foam’s high volume-to-weight ratio, foam manufacturers generally confine product shipments to a 300-mile radius in which shipping costs are economically viable. Thus, Foam Fabricators is uniquely positioned to provide multi-facility support to its largest customers who often have multiple manufacturing or distribution locations. 
Engineering and Design Capabilities - Foam Fabricators has five coordinated design and testing centers with experienced packaging and mechanical engineers that work closely with customers to support packaging design needs. Engineering services include optimizing molds to meet customer needs and address complex design requirements, identifying pre-manufacturing challenges, solving post-manufacturing issues, improving packaging processes and laboratory testing final designs. Early customer involvement and collaboration to develop packaging solutions has resulted in increased project win rates and better visibility into product development pipelines. 
Barriers to Entry 
•High Customer Switching Costs - The operational risk and disruption associated with switching existing molds to operate on a competitor’s press makes shifting or splitting business between different shape molders difficult and infrequent. In general, most customers pay for their own molds, which are custom built for a specific molders’ presses. The financial cost of retooling is estimated to be $5,000 - $25,000 per mold, making it cost prohibitive to change molders on existing projects.
•Favorable Cost-to-value Proposition - The high cost of failure, relatively low proportionate cost of foam to the final product being protected, and a sometimes lengthy testing and qualification process represent significant barriers to customers changing solution providers or packaging material choices.
•Equipment and Processing Infrastructure - Foam Fabricators’ existing base of production equipment has a significant estimated replacement cost. Management estimates the cost of opening a new shape molding facility at approximately $5 million, excluding real estate, and it must meet stringent environmental standards. A new entrant could require as much as 1-2 years of lead time to match the process performance requirements, customization of equipment and material formulations necessary to effectively compete in the molded foam industry. Moreover, Foam Fabricators has a strong preventive maintenance program and in-house equipment division that is responsible for repairing and rebuilding presses. This allows Foam Fabricators to significantly extend the average useful life of its machinery and reduce the ongoing capital investment requirements, creating an advantage over competitors. 
Business Strategies
Defend Market Position - As a leading supplier of custom molded foam solutions, management believes Foam Fabricators enjoys strong brand awareness and a reputation for superior quality and service in the industry. In a market characterized by fragmented competition, Foam Fabricators will continue to focus on providing a best in class suite of products and capabilities. 
Remain Committed to Customers - Functional and error-free products are key considerations for its customers and Foam Fabricators has maintained a disciplined approach to ensure its products meet the highest standard of quality. Utilizing a balanced scorecard, Foam Fabricators has achieved a 99.0% 1st piece acceptance rate, less than 2 complaints per 1000 shipments and a less than 0.05% rejection rate. As a result of this strong quality assurance, Foam Fabricators has had little customer attrition. 
Pursue Selective Acquisitions - Foam Fabricators views acquisitions as a potentially attractive means to expand its national footprint or broaden its current product offering. Management will continue to seek tuck-in acquisitions of regional foam molders and other packaging suppliers where sales and operational efficiencies can be realized, or to diversify into packaging products other than molded foam. 
Customers 
Foam Fabricators maintains a broad base of over 300 customers across a wide variety of end-markets, including appliances, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, consumer electronics, automotive, furniture, building products and logistics. Foam Fabricators’ products are sold primarily direct to the customer or through third-party packaging distributors. Foam Fabricators has maintained long-standing relationships with its top customers, often averaging ten or more years. Foam Fabricators three largest customers comprised approximately 43%, 44%, and 40% of sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Foam Fabricators often maintains resin cost pass-through provisions with its contracted customers, allowing them to pass-through material resin price changes - resin constitutes their primary raw material cost.
The following table sets forth Foam Fabricator's customer breakdown by sector for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

Foam Fabricators sales and marketing efforts are decentralized and generally carried out by one or two full-time salespeople who are typically also engineers at each of the manufacturing facilities. The dedicated sales team report to regional managers and vice presidents, who are collectively responsible for driving overall sales activities in their respective markets. Key customer accounts are directly managed by senior management, who coordinate efforts between manufacturing facilities to fulfill orders.
Foam Fabricators spends less than 1% of net sales each year on traditional marketing, which consists of targeted brochure advertising and maintaining its website which new customers use to make product inquiries.
Manufacturing and Distribution
Foam Fabricators maintains 14 manufacturing facilities across North America with 12 located in the U.S. and two in Mexico, as well as one non-manufacturing corporate headquarters. Given the high volume, low density nature of foam, Foam Fabricators’ manufacturing facilities are strategically located near its largest customers’ production locations to minimize freight and logistics costs. Foam Fabricators geographic footprint covers a large portion of the continental U.S. and Mexico. Each plant has a warehouse space for raw materials, supplies and finished goods. Several plants also use third-party warehousing to store excess inventory. Foam Fabricators uses common carriers to deliver finished product and in certain cases, some customers pick up directly from the plants.
Suppliers
The primary raw materials that are used in production are plastic resins, such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE). In addition to plastic resins, Foam Fabricators also purchases fabricating material including blocks of EPE and EPP foam, polyethylene and urethane, as well as other packaging materials including corrugate, boxes, paperboard, tape and plastic film. Foam 
Fabricators purchases its materials from a combination of domestic and foreign suppliers and has maintained strong relationships with key resin suppliers for over 30 years. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and Foam Fabricators’ management believes this will continue in the foreseeable future. 
Regulatory Environment

History of Sterno 
Sterno’s history dates back to 1893 when S. Sternau & Co. began making chafing dishes and coffee percolators in Tenafly, New Jersey. In 1914, S. Sternau & Co. introduced “canned heat” with the launch of its gelled ethanol product under the “Sterno” brand. Since then, the Sternau and Sterno names have been the most well-known names in portable food warming fuel. In 1917, S. Sternau & Co. was renamed The Sterno Corporation. During World War I, Sterno portable stoves were promoted as an essential gift for soldiers going to fight in the trenches of Europe. Sterno stoves heated water and rations, sterilized surgical instruments, and provided light and warmth in bunkers and foxholes. During World War II, Sterno produced ethanol and methanol chafing fuels under contract with the U.S. military. Sterno's production facilities were moved from New Jersey to Texarkana, Texas in the early 1980s. In 2012, Sterno merged with the Candle Lamp Company, LLC ("CandleLamp"). CandleLamp was founded in Riverside, California in 1978, focusing initially on the liquid wax candle market. Over the next several decades, CandleLamp began to supply chafing fuel in addition to lighting products. We purchased Sterno on October 10, 2014.
In January 2016, Sterno expanded their product offering with the acquisition of Northern International Inc. ("Sterno Home"). Sterno Home was formed in 1997 by its three founding partners who had been in the import and product 
development business since 1979. The success in the outdoor lighting an innovative use of LED technology evolved into the development of patented flameless candle product line. Sterno Home's flameless candle evolved the battery-operated candle market from a functional safety oriented product into an attractive décor piece meant to enhance the beauty of consumer’s homes. 
In February 2018, Sterno acquired Rimports. Rimports is a manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label wickless candle products used for home decor and fragrance systems under the ScentSationals, Better Home & Garden, AmbiEscents, Oak & Rye, Estate and Ador brands. Rimports offers unique lines of wickless candle products including ceramic wax warmers, scented wax cubes and essential oil and diffusers. 
Today, Sterno operates out of its corporate headquarters in Corona, California, two manufacturing facilities in Texarkana, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee, and the Rimports facility in Provo, Utah.
Industry 
Sterno Products competes in the broadly defined U.S. foodservice industry where historically restaurant, catering and hospitality sales have accounted for approximately 60% - 70% of the market with the remainder comprised of the travel and leisure, education and healthcare related sales. The Sterno Products product offerings focus on safe, portable fire solutions for cooking and warming, as well as tabletop lighting décor. 
Sterno Home competes in the outdoor lighting and home decor industry. Sterno Home's sales are concentrated in the United States and Canada, with a small percentage of sales coming through global retailers with locations in Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Australia. Management believes that a rise in demand from high-income households and businesses will bolster growth, with consumers spending more money on the cocooning trend and specifically on beautifying their indoor and outdoor home, changing out trendy accent items more frequently and investing in more spacious and comfortable outdoor spaces with many equivalent amenities of their indoor spaces.
Rimports operates in the broad U.S. home decor space (retail) which is heavily correlated to general consumer spending. Flameless and reusable wax products have seen increased adoption by younger consumers who prioritize economical and environmentally friendly products. Within the home decor space, Rimports competes in the U.S. candle space and the U.S. home fragrance space. 
Products and Services
Sterno is a “full-line” supplier offering a broad array of portable chafing fuels, table lighting, outdoor lighting products, wickless candles and fragrance products with approximately 4000 SKUs serving the foodservice and retail markets. Sterno originally focused on chafing fuel (“canned heat”) products and later expanded its offerings to include table ambiance products such as liquid wax, wax candles and votive lamps, as well as outdoor lighting with the acquisition of Sterno Home in 2016, and wax cubes and warmer products through its acquisition of Rimports. Sterno’s products fall into six major categories: canned heat, catering equipment and butane products, table lighting, flameless candles and outdoor lighting, wickless candle and fragrance products.
Canned Heat - The canned heat product line is composed of various chafing fuels packaged in small, portable cans. The portable warming (canned heat) line is composed of wick-based and gel-based chafing fuels packaged in steel cans. These products are used by foodservice professionals in a variety of food serving and holding applications and are designed to keep food products at an optimal food-safe serving temperature of 140-165 Fahrenheit. The canned heat product line is composed of two subcategories: wick chafing fuel and gel chafing fuel. The subcategories are distinguished based on the type of chafing fuel being used; the four primary chafing fuels are diethylene glycol (“DEG”), propylene glycol, ethanol and methanol. Each fuel contains unique characteristics and properties that allow the Company to offer a broad array of configurations to suit varying user requirements.
Wick Chafing Fuel
The wick chafing fuel line (“Wick”) is composed of either DEG or propylene glycol chafing fuel. DEG and propylene glycol chafing fuels with advance wick technology have higher heat output than alternatives such as ethanol and methanol. The liquid Wick products feature a variety of wick types and burn times to meet the specific needs of the user. Wick fuels are clean burning, biodegradable, nonflammable if spilled (will not ignite without a wick) and the can stays cool to the touch when lit.
Gel Chafing Fuel
The gel chafing fuel line (“Gel”) is composed of either gelled ethanol or gelled methanol chafing fuel. Ethanol chafing fuel has a higher heat output than methanol fuel; both ethanol and methanol fuels have lower heat output 
than some DEG and propylene glycol products. The Gel product line tends to have shorter burn times than the Wick product.
For an Environmentally preferred chafing fuel, the Company offers a patented line of “Green” chafing fuels featuring USDA Certified Biobased Product formulas that are also endorsed by the Green Restaurant Association. The “Green Heat” and “Green Wick” products perform similar to the Wick and Gel chafing fuels, but are made from renewable resources that are biodegradable and more environmentally friendly.
Catering Equipment - Catering equipment products are designed to provide a complete commercial catering solution whether indoor or outdoor. Products include chafing dish frames and lids, wind guards and buffet sets.
Butane - Sterno produces a full line of professional quality portable butane stoves, ideal for action stations, made-to-order omelet lines, tableside and off-site cooking, outdoor events and more. Products also include select butane accessories for special culinary applications such as the culinary torch. Sterno butane fuel comes with an additional safety feature called Countersink Release Vent (CRV) Technology.
Table Lighting - Sterno sells a variety of items designed to enhance lighting and ambiance at meal settings which are critical to a customer’s experience. Products include liquid wax, traditional hard wax and flameless electronic candles, as well as votive lamps, shaded lamps and accent lamps.
Flameless Candles and Outdoor Lighting - Through Sterno Home, Sterno offers a wide selection of lighting for your home, garden, patio and yard with over 1000 SKU's available in our retail markets. Sterno Home first delved into lighting with lighting fixtures for illuminating front and backyard pathways. Sterno Home quickly expanded its line to include other types of home lighting products, most notably bollards, shepherd hook lights and line voltage powered coach lights and street lights. Sterno Home’s 20-year history of providing high quality, low cost consumer-directed lighting has cemented it as a top tier supplier in both the flameless candle and outdoor lighting categories. All of Sterno Home’s products are powered by one of the following:
•Solar - solar panel with rechargeable power source - usually a rechargeable battery
•Battery - battery operated
•Plug-in - plugs directly into a regular wall socket either with 2 or 3 prong plug and with or without included and attached transformer
•Low Voltage - part of a set which includes a stand-alone transformer. Fixtures connect through a stand-alone wire via clip connectors
•Line Voltage - hardwired into a home's electrical circuitry
•Rechargeable - product is recharged when empty usually through a plug in wire and an onboard rechargeable power source
Flameless Candles
The flameless candle product line is made up of various types and sizes of candles with all of them sharing the one main attribute: their glow is powered by an artificial power source, most often battery. This makes them inherently safer than traditional candles as there is no flame or even heat generated to cause any type of accidents. Although pillar type candles are the most common shape, Sterno Home also designs and manufactures votives, tealights, tapers as well as specialty molded candles. Sterno Home was also the first to introduce the timer function to their flameless candle line. Sterno Home’s candles stand out from the competition as they are the only manufacturer that offers the patented black wick. Sterno Home also developed its unique algorithm-based light circuit which gives the candle a naturally random flicker and glow.
Landscape Lighting
The landscape lighting category was Sterno Home’s first offering. Starting with simple low voltage path lights, Sterno Home quickly expanded its offering to reflect the growing needs of the DIY and home décor consumer. Landscape lighting is lighting that promotes and accentuates elements of a consumer’s home, yard or garden so its beauty can be enjoyed both in daytime and nighttime. Another benefit of landscape lighting is added safety as it is easier to navigate around a home at night when it is reasonably well-lit. Landscape lighting was originally most commonly powered through a low voltage setup but as solar technologies have rapidly developed, many of these fixtures can achieve their lighting purposes with only a solar panel for power generation. Consumers with higher and more consistent lighting requirements most often opt for low voltage kits using wire and transformers to light their fixtures. Solar powered fixtures are advantageous for those consumers looking for cheaper and quicker to set up 
lighting solutions even if it often means less lumens and light. Another notable technology has been the development of LED lighting. LED’s more efficient power generation technology has allowed for advantageous fixture designs and a higher level of power generation which were not easy or as cost effective to achieve as with legacy lighting technologies such as incandescent or halogen. LEDs also last longer and are generally more robust than older technologies. 
Décor Lighting
Décor lighting is Sterno Home’s newest category. Décor lighting has similar functions to landscape lighting but is usually less about safety and functionality and more about accenting an area of the outside home with ornamentation of some sort. With a décor piece, the light the piece gives off and the item itself together become elements of beauty in the setting. Because these items are very trend driven, consumers are more apt to switch them out more often therefore increasing repeat purchase potential and other recurrent sales opportunities for Sterno Home. Some of the most common categories of décor lighting are lanterns and baskets and string lighting.

Competitive Strengths 
Leading Brand Recognition & Market Share - Sterno Products is the market share leader in the canned chafing fuel market. Management believes Sterno Products enjoys outstanding brand awareness and a reputation for superior quality and performance with distributors, caterers, hotels and other end users. Sterno Home offers a wide variety of products to a cross section of North American retail and its diversity gives us a unique standing in this marketplace. Most of Sterno Home's competitors specialize in one aspect of fulfilling the market. They either only sell to a few retailers or only actively develop few or even only one category of product. This exposes them to major financial challenges when they lose that account or when that product is beat out by a competitor or starts to wane in the marketplace. Rimports is a leader in fragrance systems, particularly the wickless candle market, and is growing its market share in the essential oils and diffusers and plug-in liquid fragrance markets. Rimports offers a large variety of products to retailers in North America, Canada, China, and the United Kingdom.
Low Cost versus Alternatives - Sterno Product's customers are typically caterers, hotels or restaurants who utilize canned chafing fuel to maintain prepared food at a safe and enjoyable serving temperature. The risk of ruining a dining experience and the low proportionate cost of canned chafing fuel relative to the cost of a catered event represent significant barriers to customers switching out of Sterno’s canned chafing fuel products. Additionally, management believes that there is no other technology available today that offers the portability, reliability and low cost of the Sterno canned chafing fuel products. Rimports’ ultimate consumers seek high quality products in the Home Fragrance section. This high value strength ensures consumer loyalty and satisfaction.
