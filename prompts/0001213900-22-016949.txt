Item 1. Business.
General



We are a blank check company incorporated on August 6, 2020, as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
Initial Public Offering



On April 13, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 16,000,000 units. Each unit consists of (i) one public subunit, which consists of one public share and one-quarter of one public warrant, and (ii) one-half of one public warrant. Each whole exercisable public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $160,000,000. The Company paid the underwriters an underwriting discount of $3,200,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 675,000 placement units to our sponsor and I-Bankers at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $6,750,000.



Transaction costs amounted to $9,673,350 consisting of $3,200,000 of underwriting discount, $5,600,000 of deferred underwriting discount, and $873,350 of other offering costs.



The Company granted I-Bankers a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,400,000 public units to cover over-allotments. On April 14, 2021, I-Bankers partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase 750,000 public units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per public unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $7,500,000. On April 14, 2021, simultaneously with the exercise of the over-allotment option, the sponsor and I-Bankers purchased an aggregate of 22,500 additional placement units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per placement unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $225,000. Transaction costs amounted to $412,500, consisting of $150,000 of underwriting discount and $262,500 of deferred underwriting discount.



Following the closing of our initial public offering on April 13, 2021 and I-Bankers’ partial exercise of the over-allotment option on April 14, 2021, an aggregate of $169,175,000 ($10.10 per public unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the public units and the placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



Our management team is led by Bryant B. Edwards, our Chief Executive Officer, and Long Long, our Chief Financial Officer. We must complete our initial business combination by April 12, 2022, 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by April 12, 2022, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



Gorilla Business Combination and PIPE Investment



On December 21, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Gorilla and Merger Sub. Gorilla is a leading market provider of video intelligence, Internet of Things security, edge AI data analytics and operational technology security solutions and services in Asia Pacific with operations and established distribution and sales channels in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.



Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at the Closing, and following the Recapitalization, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Global, with Global continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Gorilla; (ii) the ordinary shares of Global (including Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares) will be converted into Gorilla ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis; (iii) warrants to purchase the ordinary shares of Global will be converted into warrants to purchase the same number of Gorilla ordinary shares at the same exercise price and for the same exercise period; and (iv) Global will have a restated certificate of incorporation.



Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), and contingent upon the Closing, Gorilla will effect the Recapitalization pursuant to which (a) the preference shares of Gorilla will be converted into Gorilla ordinary shares in accordance with Gorilla’s organizational documents; (b) Gorilla will effect a recapitalization of Gorilla ordinary shares so that the holders of Gorilla’s ordinary shares (and options to acquire Gorilla ordinary shares that are not converted to Gorilla ordinary shares in the Recapitalization) will have shares (or the right to acquire shares, as applicable) valued at $10.00 per share having a total value of $650,000,000, on a fully diluted basis (the ratio at which Gorilla ordinary shares are recapitalized being referred to as the Conversion Ratio); and (c) with respect to outstanding options to purchase Gorilla ordinary shares, the number of Gorilla ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such security shall, as a result of the Recapitalization, become and be converted into such number of Gorilla ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) $650,000,000, by (B) $10.00, and subsequently dividing such quotient by (C) the sum of (i) the number of Gorilla ordinary shares then outstanding and (ii) without duplication, the number of Gorilla ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding options to purchase Gorilla ordinary shares, and taking such quotient to five decimal places.

Additionally, to raise additional proceeds in connection with the Transactions, Global, Gorilla and certain PIPE Investors entered into a series of PIPE Subscription Agreements, providing for the purchase by the PIPE Investors at the effective time of the Gorilla Business Combination an aggregate of 5,000,000 PIPE Subunits at a price of $10.10 per subunit, for gross proceeds to Global of $50.5 million; provided, however, that if a PIPE Investor acquires ownership of subunits of Gorilla in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties (along with any related rights to redeem or convert such subunits in connection with any redemption conducted by Global in accordance with Global’s organizational documents and the prospectus for Global’s initial public offering in conjunction with the Closing or in conjunction with an amendment to Global’s organizational documents to extend Global’s deadline to consummate its initial business combination) at least prior to Global’s meeting of shareholders to approve the Transactions and the PIPE Investor does not redeem or convert such PIPE Subunits in connection with any redemption, the number of subunits for which the PIPE Investor is obligated to purchase under the PIPE Subscription Agreement shall be reduced by the number of non-redeemed subunits.



Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Gorilla Business Combination by our shareholders in accordance with our memorandum and articles of association and the completion of a redemption offer whereby we will be providing our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public subunits.



The Business Combination Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on December 28, 2021. The PIPE Investment and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on February 11, 2022. For additional information regarding Gorilla, the Business Combination Agreement, the Gorilla Business Combination and the PIPE Investment, see the Proxy Statement.



Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of either the Gorilla Business Combination or the PIPE Investment. In the event we are unable to consummate the Gorilla Business Combination, we will continue to pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, with a focus on industries that complement our management team’s background.



Recent Developments



On March 18, 2022, we filed a preliminary proxy statement on Form PRE 14A (“Extension Proxy”) for an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held for the approval of the extension of the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination from April 13, 2022 (which is 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering) to July 13, 2022 (or such earlier date as determined by the Board).
Business Strategy



Our initial strategy is to identify a business combination target within the Middle East, North Africa (“MENA”) or South & Southeast Asia regions. Although we are not limited to any specific industry, we intend to focus on business combination targets within industries with relatively secure and predictable cash flows and growth, such as Gorilla. Our strategic partner, Innvotec Limited (“Innvotec”), whose Managing Director, Amir Kazmi, is one of our directors, possess extensive global investment experience and networks which we intend to leverage to assist us in identification of business combination targets. Although we intend to pursue a company with operations, ownership or headquarters within the targeted regions, we are not limited to doing so.



Our sponsor group includes our management team, which has extensive prior experience sponsoring SPACs, and our strategic partner, Innvotec, described below. Although Innvotec is not participating in the funding of our sponsor’s private placement, Innvotec, or its affiliates, is a member of our sponsor and has assisted us in our search for an initial business combination target. We believe that Innvotec’s relationships within our target regions and experience in investing in companies similar in profile to those we are searching for, will assist us greatly and help identify attractive potential business combination targets. Our officers and directors and Innvotec, collectively have extensive experience in international investment management, cross-border mergers & acquisitions, corporate finance, legal and regulatory matters within our target regions. See “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for additional information about our team of executive officers and directors.

Innvotec is one of the UK’s longest established independent firms focused on venture capital and private equity investments. Innvotec specializes in venture and P/E investing in more established companies across a broad range of industries and geographic regions. Innvotec is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, and directly manages two fund families: Technology SEIS/EIS Fund and Female Ventures Fund, as well as eight closed-end funds and conducts some of its corporate finance activities via the Envestors Platform. Since 2017, Innvotec has successfully exited nine portfolio positions.  The firm transacts with a wide range of counterparties, including venture or private equity funds, institutional investors, family offices, private families and founders. The firm focuses on achieving long term capital appreciation in a diversified portfolio of attractive investments which generally provide stable, long term cash flows. Selected industries in which its funds have invested include: Cleantech, Consumer Technology, Education, Engineering, Fintech, Healthcare, Internet, Apps & Media, Biotech, and general Software and Technology.



If we do not consummate the Gorilla Business Combination or any other initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our memorandum and articles of association, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from $291,139 in cash held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2021), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



We consider companies in a wide range of industries, but generally seek to acquire a high-quality business that generates predictable cash flows and growth. We prefer targets that have low sensitivity to macroeconomic factors, with minimal commodity exposure and/or cyclical risk.



Competitive Strengths



We believe that our team is well-positioned to identify companies in the market that will produce attractive risk-adjusted returns. We also believe that our contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds, the legal community and investment bankers, will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities. We are able to capitalize on our management team’s extensive network of contacts to source attractive acquisition opportunities within the regions. We believe there are many potential target companies that have operations or ownership interests that cross over between developed markets and developing markets within the regions we seek to target, and we believe our team’s experiences are well suited to source and consummate a transaction with such a company. We believe that the following benefits of our management team and structure of our company will assist us in consummating an initial business combination:

● | Well-Known Sponsor Team within Our Target Regions. Innvotec and Chief Executive Officer, Bryant Edwards possess intimate knowledge and connections within the MENA through South & Southeast Asian markets that we believe will allow us to identify and access a wide range of high-quality acquisition targets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Innvotec specializes in investing in private companies across a broad range of industries and geographic regions. The firm transacts with a wide range or counterparties, including venture or private equity funds, institutional investors, family offices, private families and founders. We believe the firms’ main focus of identifying attractive private companies, often with existing owners seeking some liquidity, is well suited to assist us in identifying among such companies that are also interested in becoming publicly-listed via a transaction with us.



Our Chief Executive Officer, Bryant Edwards, has had extensive experience in a broad array of corporate finance and strategic transactions as legal counsel in transactions across this region. Mr. Edwards, played an important role as a leading lawyer in the development of capital markets across Europe, Middle East and Asia, especially the high yield markets that served as a source of financing for many private equity investments in these markets. Among other things, Mr. Edwards helped establish the Gulf Bond & Sukuk Association, a non-profit organization focused on developing the capital debt markets in the Gulf Region, and served as Vice-Chair of the Credit Markets Committee of the Asia Securities & Financial Markets Committee, an independent trade association focused on promoting the development of capital markets in Asia.




● | Extensive Network and Experience of Transactions within MENA through South & Southeast Asian Regions. Our management team has significant private equity investing experience in cross-border businesses, with specific emphasis in MENA and South Asia. Our management team and board members collectively possess a deep understanding of the cultural, business and economic distinctions across regions to assist us in identifying acquisition targets and successfully completing a transaction. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Furthermore, Mr. Edwards and our Chief Operating Officer, Stephen N. Cannon bring considerable business and financial experience. Mr. Edwards has over 40 years of corporate, securities and financial markets legal experience, and Mr. Cannon has over 25 years of investment banking and capital markets experience. We believe that their experience will help us both access high quality targets, and successfully consummate a proposed business combination.




● | Prior SPAC Experience. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer all possess a strong understanding of the SPAC structure and market. Our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Edwards, was Chief Operating Officer of Twelve Seas (Nasdaq: BROG), a Nasdaq listed SPAC that raised $207 million in June 2018, and successfully completed its business combination in December 2019 with Brooge Energy Limited, an oil services operator in Fujairah, UAE that had a market capitalization of over $800 million. Mr. Edwards also serves as a Director of Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co., which is currently seeking an initial business combination. Our Chief Operating Officer, Stephen N. Cannon, has served as a member of management for seven other SPACs; six of which have completed initial public offerings, four of which have consummated a business combination, including Twelve Seas, where he served as Chief Financial Officer, and two of which are seeking an initial business combination, including Ackrell SPAC Partners I Co., where he serves as Chief Operating Officer and President, and Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co., where he serves as Chief Executive Officer & President. Our Chief Financial Officer, Long Long, also serves as Chief Financial Officer of Ackrell SPAC Partners I Co. and Chief Financial Officer of Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co., and was Vice President of the sponsor of Twelve Seas.

● | Reduced Competition from Other Sources of Capital. Despite progress in the capital markets in certain countries within the Pan-Eurasia region, many financial sectors, such as public markets and private equity, are still in preliminary stages of development in other countries. For many companies in these countries, being publicly listed locally is less attractive and access to capital markets generally remains relatively restrictive and offers less liquidity as compared to companies with access to the capital markets in the United States. We believe options for private equity investors to realize gains on their investments in private companies remains relatively limited in many countries in the regions. As a result, we expect to operate in a less competitive environment than other blank check companies with stated objectives to seek targets solely within the U.S. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing Availability of Potential Targets. Recent volatility in some financial markets has affected initial public offering plans for many companies, including some within the regions we intend to focus on initially. We believe any reduction in global liquidity due to this continued volatility will likely make debt refinancing more difficult and increase the costs of both debt and equity capital raising. This would make our capital more attractive as well as reduce potential competition for targets. Thus, we believe this trend may lead to a significant increase in the number of potential candidates for a business combination. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alternative Path to Becoming Public. We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses that desire to become a publicly listed company, like Gorilla. A merger with us will offer a target business an alternative process to a public listing rather than the traditional initial public offering process. We believe that target businesses may favor this alternative, even though it is more expensive, given it offers greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination such as the Gorilla Business Combination is approved by our shareholders and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to international capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management. With public company corporate governance standards, a target business may become attractive to the public investors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong and Stable Financial Position with Flexibility. With approximately $169.2 million held in trust as of December 31, 2021, and a public market for our securities, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we can consummate a business combination using cash, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties.

Our Acquisition Criteria



In the event the Gorilla Business Combination is not consummated, consistent with our investment principles and business strategy, we will continue to identify high-quality companies that have a number of the characteristics enumerated below. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, such as the Gorilla Business Combination, we may decide to complete our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some but not all of these criteria. We seek to acquire companies that have the following characteristics:

● | Growing, predictable, and free-cash-flow generating. We generally seek companies with a proven track record that are expected to generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long term;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High barriers to entry. We seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Less exposure to extrinsic factors. We seek companies that are not materially affected by commodity prices, interest rate or currency volatility and/or cyclical risk;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong balance sheet. We seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the initial business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong market growth. We seek target businesses operating in industries that benefit from economic growth and macro trends within the regions we target, such as increasing investment, GDP and/or trade;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Positive demographic trends. We seek target businesses with exposure in markets with strong demographic trends such as population growth, standard of living, and/or disposable income; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Superior management and governance. We seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations following our initial public offering until our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.



If we pay for our initial business combination using shares or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions or purchases of our public subunits, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our Board of Directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.





5







We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholders’ approval, as applicable. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and Board of Directors, we have determined that Gorilla’s fair market value was at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of the entry of the Business Combination Agreement and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities to finance our initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.



Other Acquisition Considerations



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. While Gorilla is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Gorilla Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, or our Board of Directors cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or from an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying for a target is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our Board of Directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.



Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or placement units following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.





6







Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer, Bryant B. Edwards, currently serves as a director of Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co., a SPAC which is seeking an initial business combination. Our Chief Operating Officer, Stephen N. Cannon, currently serves as Chief Operating Officer and President of Ackrell SPAC Partners I Co. and Chief Executive Officer and President of Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co., SPACs which are seeking an initial business combination. Our Chief Financial Officer, Long Long, also serves as Chief Financial Officer of Ackrell SPAC Partners I Co. and Chief Financial Officer of Archimedes Tech SPAC Partners Co. Accordingly, subject to his fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he will need to honor his fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.



In addition, our sponsor, affiliates, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination, such as the Gorilla Business Combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest. Although we have no formal policy in place for vetting potential conflicts of interest, our Board of Directors will review any potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis.



Corporate Information



Our units, subunits, ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.



Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with this Report. As long as we maintain our status as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



Status as a Public Company



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following April 13, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $250 million as of the end of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the prior June 30th.



Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.



Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination



In connection with the Gorilla Business Combination, the Company will offer redemption rights to its current public shareholders, the details of which are set forth in our Proxy Statement.



In the event an initial business combination, such as the Gorilla Business Combination, is not consummated, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public subunits upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-subunit price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public subunits, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was approximately $10.10 per public share as of March 31, 2022. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, affiliates, officers, directors and I-Bankers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, placement shares, representative shares and any public subunits they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.



Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A public subunits upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination, such as the Gorilla Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer if the Gorilla Business Combination is not consummated. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.





8







If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our memorandum and articles of association:




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public subunits through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.



In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.



If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our memorandum and articles of association:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.



In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.



If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor, affiliates, officers, directors and I-Bankers have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any founder shares, placement shares and representative shares held by them and any public subunits purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, our sponsor, affiliates, officers, directors, and I-Bankers and its permitted transferees will own approximately 21.7% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon, assuming no purchase by our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates of public units in our initial public offering or thereafter. We may only require 6,150,001 or 36.7% of the 16,750,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination, assuming all the outstanding shares are present at the meeting to approve such transaction. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, affiliates, officers, directors and I-Bankers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, placement shares, representative shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination.



Our memorandum and articles of association provide that we will only redeem our public subunits so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public subunits may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all public subunits that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all public subunits submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our sponsor, affiliates, officers, directors and I-Bankers have, pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares, placement shares, representative shares or public subunits held by them redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted transfer from an initial shareholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares in our initial public offering or thereafter through open market purchases, it would be a public shareholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess Shares.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination



Our sponsor, affiliates, officers and directors have agreed that we will have only the time of the completion window to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public subunits, at a per-subunit price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public subunits, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.



Our sponsor, affiliates, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our initial holders, sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.



If the Gorilla Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the expiration of the completion window.





10







Our initial holders, sponsor, affiliates, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our memorandum and articles of association that would (i) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public subunits if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or (ii) with respect to the other provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public subunits upon approval of any such amendment at a per-subunit price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public subunits. However, we will only redeem our public subunits so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public subunits such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public subunits.



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $850,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.10. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we have sought and will continue to seek to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public subunits, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. None of our directors and officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.





11







In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.10 per share.



We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor has to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all third parties (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.



If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy insolvency court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public subunits properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public subunits if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public subunits if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.



Memorandum and Articles of Association



Our memorandum and articles of association contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to our business combination that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public subunits in connection with any such vote. Our sponsor, affiliates, officers, directors and I-Bankers have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, placement shares, representative shares and public subunits in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:




● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






12








● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, we receive the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within the completion window, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote in a general meeting. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our memorandum and articles of association provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company.



Indemnity



Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.
Employees



As of the date of this Report, we have three officers but no employees. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary and intend to continue doing so to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that our officers or any other members of our management team devote in any time period will vary based on the current stage of the business combination process.
