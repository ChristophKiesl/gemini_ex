Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 Our mission is to help Americans get the healthcare they need at a price they can afford. To achieve this, we are building the leading, consumer-focused digital healthcare platform in the United States.
 GoodRx was founded to solve the challenges that consumers face in understanding, accessing, and affording healthcare. We started with a price comparison tool for prescriptions, offering consumers free access to lower prices on their medication. We wanted to help ensure that no parent had to choose between their child’s next meal and their life-saving medication. Today, we believe our expanded platform improves the health and financial well-being of American families by providing easy access to price transparency and affordability solutions for generic and brand medications, affordable and convenient medical provider consultations via telehealth and additional healthcare services and information. In addition to reducing the costs of healthcare for consumers, we believe that our offerings can help drive greater medication adherence, faster treatment and better patient outcomes. 
 We see exciting growth potential as we continue to attract new consumers through our existing offerings, launch new offerings to address more of the needs of healthcare consumers, and improve healthcare affordability and access for all Americans. As we extend our platform, we believe that we can create multiple monetization opportunities at different stages of the consumer healthcare journey, enabling us to drive higher expected consumer lifetime value without significant additional consumer acquisition costs.
 Our business model has facilitated the rapid growth and expansion of our platform. We have been focused on capital efficiency and delivering on a cash generative monetization model since inception, and we have been able to reinvest our cash flows in our business. As a result, our consumers can now access an increasingly broad platform with a variety of integrated offerings that provide healthcare affordability, access and convenience. Whether a consumer is insured or uninsured, young or old, or suffers from an acute or a chronic ailment, we strive to be at the consumer’s side throughout their healthcare journey.
 Our platform has been effective because we positively impact stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. Benefits to participants in the healthcare ecosystem include: achieving better outcomes by increasing medication adherence; providing fast access to preventative care to reduce the strain on hospitals and emergency departments; increasing accessibility to affordable prescriptions that otherwise may not have been filled; and enhancing consumer satisfaction and engagement. We believe that consumers, healthcare providers, pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and telehealth providers all win with GoodRx. Our partnerships across the healthcare ecosystem, scale and strong consumer brand create a deep competitive moat that is reinforced by our proprietary technology platform, which processes and integrates pricing data points into an interface that is convenient and easy to use for consumers.
 Industry Challenges
 Despite the U.S. healthcare market being one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy, it remains opaque and highly fragmented for consumers. Even simple healthcare transactions, such as finding a doctor or filling a prescription at an affordable price, are difficult. This can lead to confusion, inefficiency and unneeded additional costs for consumers and the healthcare system. The pharmacy is the de-facto “front door” to American healthcare, with frequent consumer interaction and engagement. However, finding affordable prices for prescriptions is complicated by a lack of price transparency, a confusing reimbursement and insurance landscape and a fragmented marketplace in which the list prices for the same medication can vary more than 100 times across pharmacies. Similarly, people who need to see healthcare professionals can face the same lack of price transparency, as well as exceedingly long wait times to access the care that they need.
 6

We believe that these challenges are driven in part by a lack of consumer-focused solutions that enable consumers to easily search, discover and access the product or service that they need at an affordable price. Technology similar to that which has been deployed to help consumers buy airline tickets, rent homes or hail cars can also be utilized in the highly complex healthcare market to make healthcare affordable, accessible and efficient. Consumer-focused technology solutions are even more essential in healthcare than in other industries given that the stakes involve peoples’ health and lives.
 The challenges that healthcare consumers face have been increasing for decades, while the solutions to combat these issues have remained largely absent:
  
• | Lack of Consumer-Focused Solutions: Health is the most essential aspect of peoples’ lives. However, healthcare has remained largely unaffected by many of the market and technology-driven forces that have improved many other facets of life. Technology-driven platforms have empowered consumers with ease of access and price transparency across many other industry verticals. As a result, consumers now demand what they want, when they want it, and how they want it—all at a value that makes sense to them. Traditional healthcare companies have been slow to adapt to these demands, disconnecting those businesses from the needs of healthcare consumers. We believe that an increase in access to information, price transparency and ease of use can benefit healthcare consumers, just as it has helped consumers purchase goods and services in other industries.

• | Lack of Affordability: Healthcare is so unaffordable that medical problems have historically contributed to a significant number of all personal bankruptcies in the United States and many Americans risk their health by avoiding or delaying medical care due to the anticipated expenses. Furthermore, insurance companies and employers in the United States have shifted an increasing amount of the financial burden of healthcare onto their members and employees through higher deductibles and increasing co-pays and co-insurance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of Transparency: The healthcare system is highly complex and fragmented. Price variability for prescription medication and other healthcare services can be significant. Unlike almost every other industry, healthcare consumers are faced with a lack of transparency and have a limited ability to compare prices for prescription medication or the cost of care across providers. We believe that many consumers are not aware of tools that are available to help them save money. Our data shows that list prices for the same medication can, in some instances, vary by more than 100 times. Similarly, common healthcare services and surgical procedures can vary greatly in price. This can lead to consumer frustration, unnecessary cost, and in many cases, failure to adhere to a medication, undergo a treatment or get a medical test.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of Access to Care: Consumers face challenges gaining access to affordable, timely and quality care. The lack of access to this care limits the ability of many consumers to quickly and effectively address relatively basic needs, such as obtaining medication for high blood pressure or diagnosing an infection. Failure to receive early diagnosis and treatment often leads to more severe illness and can require more costly medical treatment in the future.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of Resources for Healthcare Professionals: Physicians and other healthcare professionals know that their patients increasingly expect to have a conversation regarding the cost of their treatment or medications, but they tend to have limited access to current information regarding the out-of-pocket financial burden of prescriptions or treatment and are typically unaware as to whether the patient will be able to afford the prescribed medication or treatment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Market Opportunity
 A paradigm shift is occurring in healthcare as consumers are both increasingly informed and cost-conscious. We believe that allowing people to transact using more information than ever before will help Americans consume healthcare more efficiently. This can be accomplished by providing a healthcare platform that allows consumers to search a broad range of choices and offerings, discover what is best for them, transact based on their preferences, and receive the best price while doing so.

 7

We believe this market opportunity is substantial and estimate the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our current solutions to be approximately $800 billion. This includes a $524 billion prescription opportunity, inclusive of prescriptions that are written but not filled, a $30 billion pharmaceutical manufacturer solutions opportunity and a $250 billion telehealth opportunity.
 

Prescription Opportunity
 The vast majority of the utilization of our platform relates to generic medications. We also enable consumers to save on brand medications. We believe that the prices available through our platform are highly competitive, for both insured and uninsured consumers, and our platform enables consumers to save on prescription medications regardless of whether the consumer is insured or not. We believe we can drive significant growth in our prescription opportunity through our ability to continue to provide attractive prescription pricing to consumers.
Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Solutions Opportunity
 Brand medications tend to be expensive, and insurance coverage is complicated and may be restrictive. Pharmaceutical manufacturers provide affordability solutions, such as co-pay cards, patient assistance programs and other savings options, so that consumers can access their medications. We partner with pharmaceutical manufacturers to advertise and integrate these affordability solutions into our platform. We believe this offering can deliver incremental margin as we deploy these solutions across our existing base of consumers and visitors.
Telehealth Opportunity
 The telehealth market is a natural expansion of our platform. There is a growing consumer preference for on-demand services, which is rapidly changing how healthcare services are delivered. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the utilization of telehealth among consumers. We believe that the addition of telehealth to our platform will increase consumer engagement and improve outcomes. Through GoodRx Care and the GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace, we can provide consumers with a convenient and affordable way to receive a diagnosis and a prescription online, when medically appropriate, and we believe our telehealth offerings will enhance the accessibility of our prescription offering for these consumers. Consumers may opt in to use our prescription offering through GoodRx Care in order to fill their prescriptions. We also partner with some of the telehealth providers in the GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace to enable consumers to opt in to use our prescription offering for their prescription needs after they complete their online visit. These integrated solutions provide our consumers with additional value and convenience in their healthcare journey and add monetization opportunities for us after consumers visit a healthcare professional online.

Our Value Proposition
 GoodRx was founded to provide consumers with solutions to the complexity, affordability and transparency challenges American healthcare presents. These challenges can reduce medication adherence and can have severe, broad-ranging impacts on both the health and financial well-being of Americans. Our platform helps to improve the lives of individuals by providing them with easy access to affordable healthcare. In addition to reducing the costs of healthcare for consumers, we believe that our platform can drive greater medication adherence, faster treatment and better patient outcomes, all of which can create a healthier, happier population.
 We positively impact many key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. Benefits to participants in the broader healthcare ecosystem include: achieving better outcomes by increasing medical adherence; providing timely access to preventative care to reduce the strain on hospitals and emergency departments; increasing access to affordable prescriptions that otherwise may not have been filled; and enhancing consumer satisfaction. We believe that consumers, healthcare providers, PBMs, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and telehealth providers all win with GoodRx. This, in turn, can drive beneficial and self-reinforcing network effects.
 Our value proposition by stakeholder is described below:
  
• | Consumers: Our platform provides consumers with a variety of mobile-first offerings designed to make their access to healthcare simple and more affordable. We help people fill prescriptions that they may otherwise not have filled due to cost, and enable them to access treatments through telehealth that they may otherwise have delayed due to long wait times for in-person visits. These solutions increase medication adherence, reduce strain on hospital emergency departments and physicians, and improve health outcomes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our prescription offering provides curated, geographically relevant price comparisons and negotiated prices on prescriptions that generate substantial savings to our consumers. Our negotiated prices for prescriptions are often cheaper than insurance co-pays. Access to discounted prices is free for consumers through our platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our subscription offerings provide consumers and their families with access to even lower prescription prices on select medications in select pharmacies for a monthly or annual subscription fee.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our pharmaceutical manufacturer solutions offering provides advertising and integrated consumer affordability solutions to pharmaceutical manufacturers with the goal of improving access to and affordability of brand medications for consumers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our telehealth offerings provide access to online doctor visits, lab test providers and a marketplace of recommended third-party telehealth providers for over 150 medical conditions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our platform provides educational resources to help inform consumers about their healthcare. We provide consumers with expert medication information, as well as pricing and coverage information made possible through our robust data sources and staff of experienced researchers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Healthcare Professionals: Physicians and other healthcare professionals are motivated to help patients, and, increasingly, are judged by patient outcomes. We help these healthcare professionals improve patient outcomes by encouraging medication adherence and providing a consumer-friendly service. We are able to integrate our pricing information and GoodRx codes directly into Electronic Health Record (“EHR”) systems, enabling healthcare professionals to provide prices from our platform directly to their patients at the point of prescribing, including via EHR-sent text messages and emails. We help physicians engage with patients both directly through GoodRx Care and indirectly by providing healthcare professionals who engage in telehealth the ability to list their services on our GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Healthcare Companies: PBMs, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and telehealth providers use our platform to reach and provide affordability solutions to consumers. We play a valuable role within the healthcare ecosystem by aggregating, normalizing, and presenting information from all of these constituents on a single platform for the consumer. Through the deep relationships that we have developed with these stakeholders over many years, we are able to continually improve our offerings and achieve better pricing outcomes for consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pharmacy Benefit Managers: PBMs aggregate consumer demand to negotiate prescription medication prices with pharmacies and manufacturers. PBMs aggregate most of their demand through relationships with insurance companies and employers. However, nearly all PBMs also have consumer direct or cash network pricing that they negotiate with pharmacies for consumers who choose to purchase prescriptions outside of insurance. We provide a platform through which PBMs can drive incremental volume to these networks by offering their discounted prices to our consumers. We expand the market for PBMs by increasing their cash network transaction volumes and by adding new consumers to the overall prescriptions market, many of whom, both insured and uninsured, would otherwise not fill their prescriptions because of high deductibles or prices. For many of our PBM partners, we are their only significant direct-to-consumer channel. To date, we have retained all of our PBM partners, which highlights the strength of our relationships alongside the value we deliver.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pharmacies: With GoodRx, pharmacies can reduce ‘walk away’ patients and prescriptions abandoned at the counter due to high cost, and can also increase overall sales through additional foot-traffic. We work with pharmacies on integrated technology and marketing programs to help them attract pharmacy customers. For example, we partner with Kroger, the fourth largest retail pharmacy in the United States, to provide a tailored co-branded subscription product, Kroger Rx Savings Club powered by GoodRx. We work closely with pharmacies to ensure that pharmacists are educated on how to use our apps and websites, and know how to apply GoodRx codes at the point of sale. Consumers can use GoodRx at nearly every retail pharmacy in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pharmaceutical Manufacturers: Brand medications tend to be more expensive than generics, and insurance coverage is complicated. GoodRx works with pharmaceutical manufacturers to advertise, integrate and enhance consumer awareness and uptake of their various savings solutions for brand medications, increasing the likelihood that a consumer will start or continue to take their prescribed medication.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Telehealth Providers: In addition to operating our own telehealth provider, GoodRx Care, we partner with select telehealth providers through our GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace. We display their prices and services on the marketplace section of our apps and websites, driving incremental traffic for them.

Our Offerings
 Prescription Offering
 We have built a vast network of relationships, contracts and integrations with key stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Our proprietary technology enables us to aggregate prescription pricing data points from sources spanning the healthcare industry. We structure and normalize the presentation of the data to give consumers curated, geographically relevant pricing information that is accessible through our apps or websites for free. By normalize, we refer to a process of taking the various different pricing methodologies and medication lists from each of our sources, and homogenizing the presentation of this data so that prices are directly comparable. Consumers can choose the lowest price from a selection of nearby pharmacies, save a GoodRx code to their mobile device for free and present that code at their pharmacy to access that low price. 
 10

Once a consumer has used a GoodRx code from our platform to purchase a prescription, that code is recorded in the pharmacy’s database and the consumer is not required to present their GoodRx code again for subsequent prescription refills, or, in many cases, for additional prescriptions that the consumer purchases at that pharmacy. We earn revenue upon the initial usage of the GoodRx code when the consumer realizes savings compared to the list price at the pharmacy, and we continue to earn revenue when the consumer returns to the pharmacy for refills and new prescriptions. This results in high and increasing repeat activity, which refers to the second and later use of our discounted prices by a single GoodRx consumer, on our platform. We track prices and update our database on a daily basis, which helps ensure that consumers have access to accurate prescription pricing. 
 Our pricing sources span the healthcare industry and include PBMs, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, patient assistance programs, and others, making it difficult to replicate the data we possess and share with consumers. We believe it is important to work with as many of the key stakeholders of the healthcare industry as possible in order to increase the affordability options for our consumers. Our broad set of long-term relationships across the industry, combined with our proprietary platform, allows us to present highly competitive prices to consumers.
 PBMs are the most common source of pricing information and are the source of the majority of our revenue from prescriptions. Our proprietary technology enables us to combine prices from multiple PBMs and other industry sources and display it on a single consumer interface. We believe that we maintain the largest database of aggregated pricing information across PBMs in the United States. When a transaction occurs in which one of our consumers fills a prescription and saves compared to the list price using a GoodRx code, the PBM receives a portion of the price that the consumer paid. We receive a percentage of this amount or a fixed payment from the PBM as compensation for directing the consumer to that PBM’s pricing and the pharmacy.
 As we help more consumers save money on their medications and drive additional traffic through various PBMs, we increase our scale, which over time leads to lower prices for our consumers. We have steadily increased the number of PBMs with which we work over time. To date, a PBM has never terminated a relationship with us. Even if a contract with a PBM were to be terminated, many of our contracts require the PBM to continue to pay us for activity by consumers originally directed to their pricing by us, even subsequent to the contract termination. The ongoing payment obligation can continue for so long as the underlying PBM-specific pricing is used, or for certain partners, for a specified multi-year period, depending on the terms of our contract with the PBM. Throughout our history, we have been able to help our consumers realize increased savings. PBM mix and relative share on our platform has varied over time as we have added new PBMs and as certain PBMs have delivered more or less favorable pricing relative to other PBMs. Even as the mix has changed, we have continued to grow and deliver a strong value proposition to our consumers. We believe that our sources of pricing are sufficiently broad and robust that the loss of any one PBM or other healthcare partner would generally result in minimal disruption in our ability to provide competitive discounts and pricing. Although the majority of our pricing information comes from PBMs, we also collect pricing data points from other sources in order to help save our consumers as much money as possible. 
 Subscription Offerings
 Our subscription offerings are a natural extension of our successful prescription offering. We leverage our relationships across the healthcare ecosystem and our product expertise to provide subscribers with even greater savings and convenience at select pharmacies. We launched our first subscription offering, Gold, in 2017, and added a second offering, Kroger Savings, in 2018.

• | GoodRx Gold: We offer a subscription savings program whereby subscribers generally pay a monthly fee of $5.99 for individuals or $9.99 for families of up to five, for access to even lower prices in select participating pharmacies. We have also recently added a mail order feature as well as access to discounted telehealth services to the GoodRx Gold plan, which provides Gold subscribers with additional value and convenience, with no additional subscription fees.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | Kroger Rx Savings Club powered by GoodRx: We partner with Kroger, the fourth largest retail pharmacy in the United States, to offer a tailored subscription product to Kroger consumers for an annual fee of $36 for individuals or $72 for families of up to six. Subscribers access lower prescription prices at Kroger pharmacies, including over 100 common generic medications for free, $3.00, or $6.00 price points, and savings on more than 1,000 other generic medications. We manage key aspects of the program, including subscriber registration, consumer billing, transaction processing and marketing. Subscribers pay an annual fee, a portion of which we share with Kroger.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our subscription offerings are designed to be easy to use and provide subscribers with added benefits and features, such as refill reminders, price alerts and other notifications. 
 Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Solutions Offering
 Brand medications tend to be expensive, and insurance coverage is complicated and may be restrictive. As a result, many consumers are not able to access or afford these medications.
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers provide affordability solutions such as co-pay cards, patient assistance programs, care portals and other savings options so that consumers can access their medications. We partner with pharmaceutical manufacturers to advertise and integrate these affordability solutions into our platform. For example, a consumer searching for a brand medication on our platform can select their insurance status and related criteria so that we can automatically determine their eligibility for specific manufacturer savings solutions, and route them to the best option. 
 In addition, the patient can sign up for ongoing savings alerts related to that medication. We believe our trusted brand, large volume of high intent consumers and easy-to-use interface make our platform highly attractive to pharmaceutical manufacturers. These solutions generally increase the likelihood that consumers will start or continue their prescribed medication.
 Our pharmaceutical manufacturer solutions offering delivers a product that both increases overall consumer satisfaction and drives incremental consumer lifetime value at a low incremental cost to us. We expect to continue to grow this offering through further engagement with pharmaceutical manufacturers. We believe this offering can deliver incremental margin as we deploy these solutions across our existing base of consumers and visitors.
 Telehealth Offerings
 We have built a telehealth platform that is designed to meet the needs of our consumers who seek rapid and affordable access to quality care. Our two-pronged approach includes our own telehealth provider, GoodRx Care, as well as our GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace, which is a marketplace designed to bring third party providers to our ecosystem so that we can provide consumers with a breadth of services in a single platform.
 We launched our telehealth offerings in 2019 with the acquisition of GoodRx Care (formerly HeyDoctor). We have in-house healthcare providers through our affiliated professional entities and contracts with a network of on-demand physicians who operate on our purpose-built EHR. Our EHR includes messaging, video chat and electronic prescriptions, and integrates with our prescription offering. We offer telehealth visits to provide consumers with quick, easy and affordable access to healthcare, covering over 35 conditions across 50 states, with visits starting at $19, which are offered to patients on a cash-pay basis outside of insurance.
 Consumers who search for medication on GoodRx in certain instances may not have a prescription at the time of their search. Through GoodRx Care, we provide consumers with a convenient and affordable way to receive a diagnosis and a prescription online, when medically appropriate. Once they complete their online visit, consumers are able to choose to fill their prescriptions, should they receive one, at retail locations using a GoodRx code, or via mail order through a third-party partner. Our expansion into telehealth has unlocked additional growth opportunities through access to Americans with no or inadequate access to primary care physicians. 
 12

In March 2020, we launched our GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace, an online marketplace for individuals to access third-party providers of telehealth and lab tests. Our GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace added additional services, conditions, and geographies to our online telehealth offerings, and also provides alternative providers for the conditions and geographies already covered by GoodRx Care, providing consumers with additional options to choose from. The GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace allows consumers to search for treatment for over 150 conditions across all 50 states, and displays results with information that helps consumers compare services, review prescription delivery options, and receive pricing information. Our marketplace also presents similar information for lab tests, allowing consumers to search for providers by lab test type. Current services range from screenings and diagnosis to treatment plans and prescriptions, covering medical issues such as birth control, acne, urinary tract infections, COVID-19, cold and flu. We earn fees for directing traffic to these third-party telehealth providers in our marketplace.
 Together with GoodRx Care, the GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace provides a set of integrated solutions that simplifies the consumer healthcare journey and offers quick, easy and affordable access to treatment. From the comfort of their own homes, consumers can use our services to complete an online visit with a doctor and get a prescription, all within minutes. In March 2020, we also launched an integrated service that allows GoodRx Care consumers to opt in to use our prescription offering for their prescription needs after they complete their online visit. We have also partnered with some of the telehealth providers in the GoodRx Telehealth Marketplace to enable consumers to opt in to use our prescription offering for their prescription needs after they complete their online visit. The introduction of these integrated solutions and the addition of mail order provides our consumers with additional value and convenience in their healthcare journey, and adds monetization opportunities for us after consumers visit a healthcare professional online.
 Sales & Marketing
 We attract consumers to our apps and websites through several entry points:
  
• | Example Entry Point A – Word of Mouth: We benefit from strong word of mouth referrals, helping drive significant organic traffic to our apps and websites. A consumer may be attracted to our platform after speaking to a family member or a friend who has used one of our offerings and saved money.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Example Entry Point B – Physician: A consumer sees their physician to have their blood pressure checked. The physician establishes that the patient’s blood pressure is excessive, and determines based on the patient’s history that medication is required. The patient is concerned about the price of the medication, and the physician looks up the price for that patient in their EHR, which has GoodRx pricing integrated into it. The physician then shares the GoodRx code with their patient via text or email, which the patient then shows to the pharmacist when they pick up the medication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Example Entry Point C – GoodRx Care Telehealth Consultation: A consumer needs to see a physician, but their primary care provider says that the next available appointment is in 30 days. The consumer searches online for quick ways to see a doctor and finds GoodRx Care. Within 40 minutes, the consumer has completed a consultation with a GoodRx Care physician and has been booked for a lab test with one of GoodRx Care’s lab partners that afternoon. The GoodRx Care physician confirms that the lab results warrant a prescription medication. The consumer is offered a choice of GoodRx Care’s mail order delivery service, which is processed by a third-party partner, or to fill the prescription at a local pharmacy, where the patient can use a GoodRx code to achieve savings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Example Entry Point D – GoodRx Marketing: A consumer sees a GoodRx online ad or TV commercial and visits our app to see if we can save them money on their prescription. The consumer uses GoodRx to find the lowest price available at a nearby pharmacy. In order to access this discounted price, they save a GoodRx code for their selected prescription to their mobile device and present it at the chosen pharmacy. After several refills, the GoodRx app prompts the consumer to try our subscription product, Gold, where for a monthly fee they can access an even lower price for their selected prescription and thousands of other medications. In addition, a consumer can see a GoodRx online ad or TV commercial and visit our app to obtain telehealth services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consumers come to our platform organically and also through our sales and marketing initiatives. The GoodRx brand benefits from word-of-mouth recommendations to consumers from friends, healthcare professionals and pharmacists, as well as press coverage, which drives significant unpaid traffic to our apps and websites. 
 In addition to organic consumer acquisition, our sales and marketing efforts are designed to bring new consumers onto our platform for the first time and to re-engage existing consumers. We acquire new consumers through a variety of channels.
  
• | Direct to Consumer Marketing:
--+------------------------------


o | TV: We advertise both on traditional linear television as well as through digital streaming. We buy media through agencies and manage targeting through internal analytics and external partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Paid Search: We buy search advertising primarily through Google and Bing. We use both external vendors and internal analytics for bid optimization and channel strategy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Other Digital: We execute display, paid social, and mobile advertising campaigns.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Marketing through Partners
--+---------------------------


o | Healthcare Professional Marketing: We market through healthcare professionals by providing in-office materials, enabling them to distribute information regarding our offerings to their patients. We have also built GoodRx Pro, an app designed specifically for healthcare professionals to facilitate electronic prescriptions. This app is integrated with our prescription offering to enable physicians to quickly find the form, dosage and quantity of medication that they intend to prescribe and seamlessly send pricing that is available on GoodRx to their patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | EHRs: We work with several of the largest electronic health record providers, or EHRs, which integrate pricing from our platform into their prescribing workflows so that healthcare professionals can provide prices from our platform to their patients at the point of prescribing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Affiliates: We partner with a variety of organizations to distribute our discounts and solutions to a broader target audience.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Content Creation
--+-----------------


o | Essential Source of Consumer Healthcare Insights: Our market research and content creation teams seek to make GoodRx the essential consumer platform for relevant healthcare information, education and updates. Relevant healthcare content increases traffic to the GoodRx apps and websites, providing us with more opportunities to convert visitors to active consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we still have significant opportunities to improve our unaided awareness, to build our brand, as well as to scale existing marketing channels, and unlock new ones.
 We also deploy a variety of consumer retention tools on our platform. These include:
  
• | Savings Information Retained in Pharmacy Database: When a consumer uses a GoodRx code, the code is saved to the consumer’s profile at the pharmacy. From then on, the discounted price typically applies to future refills and new prescriptions without the consumer having to re-present the GoodRx code.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

 
• | Consumer Lifecycle Management: We engage with consumers to provide them with value-added information that improves their experience using our platform. Types of engagement include savings alerts, medication information alerts, refill reminders and links to our other offerings such as telehealth visits when a prescription is about to expire.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Support & Patient Advocacy: Consumers often need additional, higher-touch support to understand the cost and coverage options for their medication. We provide strong consumer support and patient advocacy services to help consumers understand how best to afford their medication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology:
  
• | Proprietary Pricing Engine: Our price ingestion technology enables us to link with multiple sources spanning the healthcare industry. In addition, we have proprietary patented technology related to collecting and normalizing prices from multiple PBMs and presenting them using a single consumer interface.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Constant Data Refresh: Displaying our prescription- and location-specific list of prices to each consumer in near real-time requires the rapid processing of a significant amount of data, the use of complex predictive models, and sophisticated software programming and design.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Living Database: Our dataset becomes more comprehensive and accurate with every prescription filled. We use our proprietary algorithms to create actionable insights and continuously improve our consumer experience. Our database is central to the value that we provide to our consumers through accurate pricing and improved recommendations. We refer to our data as “living,” meaning that it is dynamic and continually being updated or refined.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning: Our engine is also able to learn from and react to changes in prescribing habits or to ensure that consumers are selecting the accurate dosing or form of a given medication. For example, our engine will automatically show the most common dose of a given medication. We also take into account pharmacy-level dispensing patterns that may impact the price of a medication, such as when two pharmacy locations that are part of the same pharmacy chain dispense the same medication, but source the medication from different manufacturers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Proprietary Telehealth EHR: We have built a proprietary EHR to support GoodRx Care. This EHR is used by physicians to conduct online patient visits, with built-in messaging and video capabilities, as well as the ability to send consumers electronic prescriptions, prescription pricing, and mail order options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable: Our digital platform is cloud native, scalable and reliable. We leverage major third-party cloud and data service providers and have built a modular system of services on top of this infrastructure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Secure: Trust is critical to our relationship with both our consumers and our partners and we take security and privacy very seriously. We implement security procedures and policies informed by various industry-standard frameworks. Our operations are audited annually as part of a SOC2 audit, based on principles developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and we have obtained SOC2 certification with respect to our prescription offering and subscription offerings. In addition, our security is tested through our bug-bounty program. We continue to expand our team and solutions to address emerging risks and changes in the threat landscape.

Our Growth Strategy
 The key elements of our growth strategy include:
  
• | Continue to Attract New Consumers: We believe that we have a significant opportunity to serve all Americans. By growing awareness of our existing offerings and through the extension of our platform into many of the other areas of healthcare that lack price transparency and consumer empowerment, we believe that we can address an increasingly larger portion of the healthcare market in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to Facilitate Existing GoodRx Consumers’ Adoption of Multiple GoodRx Offerings: We aim to increase the number of our monetization channels used by our existing consumers. We believe that this will result in higher consumer satisfaction and be accretive to our consumer lifetime value and to our margins in the medium to long term, without significant additional consumer acquisition costs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to Build the GoodRx Brand: We believe that there are significant opportunities to increase awareness and educate healthcare consumers regarding prescription pricing, as well as our platform and solutions. As we continue to invest in marketing, we anticipate that many of the consumers who do not fully understand prescription pricing, or that are not aware of tools such as our platform, will begin using our platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in Product Offerings: We plan to continue to invest in and scale our range of product offerings to better address the needs of consumers, provide them with better pricing, and improve their overall healthcare journey. We have a multi-prong approach for this strategy which includes:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Subscription Offerings: The usage of Gold and Kroger Savings has increased significantly. We believe these offerings have higher lifetime value than our prescription transactions offering. We will continue to increase the value proposition for consumers by bundling various existing and new offerings in affordable and consumer-friendly subscription packages.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Solutions Offering: We believe our trusted brand, large volume of high intent consumers and easy-to-use consumer experience make our offering highly attractive to pharmaceutical manufacturers. The solutions offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers on our platform can increase the likelihood that consumers will start to take or continue to take their prescribed medication. We plan to continue to expand the number of pharmaceutical manufacturers with which we work, as well as enhance our existing offerings and introduce new integrated technology solutions that will allow manufacturers to interact with our consumer base more effectively.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Telehealth Offerings: We believe our telehealth offerings will become more integrated with, and will be a growth driver for, our other offerings, including our prescription offering and mail order prescriptions through a third-party provider. We plan to significantly invest in our telehealth offerings, as we see this as an opportunity to add another key consumer entry point into our platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Future Expansion Opportunities: We believe there are many other areas of healthcare that could benefit from the transparency and accessibility provided by our platform. While we are currently focused on scaling our existing offerings, we see attractive opportunities to deploy our expertise in markets such as clinical trials, in person doctor visits and prescription delivery, among others. As we continue to grow our brand awareness and consumer base, selling additional products and services into our large acquired base will drive an attractive incremental margin opportunity.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: We are a valuable partner to a variety of healthcare constituents. We have completed a number of strategic acquisitions in the last two years, including GoodRx Care (formerly HeyDoctor) in 2019 and Scriptcycle in 2020. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to pursue strategic opportunities, including commercial relationships and acquisitions, to strengthen our market position and enhance our capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition and Industry Participants
 Although we have built and scaled a differentiated consumer internet platform, we face a variety of types of competition. We believe that our primary barrier to adoption is awareness. Americans have historically not had to be active consumers of healthcare since benefit plans were more generous and open than they are today. Many consumers are not aware that prices for the same prescription vary between pharmacies or that there are competitive cash prices available that may be lower than insurance prices. Similarly, most consumers are not aware of the range of direct-to-consumer telehealth options available at low cash prices, and think that they must wait days or weeks to see a doctor in-person. We have had to raise consumer awareness about healthcare consumerism and we believe that we will need to continue to be a market leader in raising consumer and healthcare provider awareness for our services and products.
 We compete with companies that provide prescription savings, telehealth, and solutions to pharmaceutical manufacturers. New entrants may also enter our industry and compete with us. Generally, we believe that we are able to compete effectively against these organizations based on our brand, scale, pricing and consumer experience. Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their offerings.
  
• | In prescriptions discounts and price comparisons, our competition is fragmented and consists of competitors that are smaller than us in scale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our pharmaceutical manufacturer solutions offering competes for advertising and market access budget allocation against platforms on which manufacturers can reach consumers, including health-related websites and mobile apps, and services supporting patient access. We believe that our trusted brand and our platform allows us to engage patients about the cost of their brand medications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In telehealth, we compete with other providers of telehealth services that are larger than us, and which usually provide telehealth services on behalf of employers and insurance plans. We believe that our direct-to-consumer business model and low cash price points (in addition to our brand and scale) help differentiate our telehealth offerings from these competitors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is currently significant concentration in the U.S. healthcare industry, and in particular there are a limited number of PBMs, including pharmacies’ in-house PBMs, and a limited number of national pharmacy chains. If we are unable to retain favorable contractual arrangements with our PBMs, including any successor PBMs should there be further consolidation of PBMs, we may lose them as customers, or the negotiated rates provided by such PBMs may become less competitive, which could have an adverse impact on our platform.
 A limited number of PBMs generate a significant percentage of the discounted prices that we present through our platform and, as a result, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with a limited number of PBMs. We work with more than a dozen PBMs that maintain cash networks and prices, and the number of PBMs we work with has significantly increased over time, limiting the extent to which any one PBM contributes to our overall revenue; however, we may not expand beyond our existing PBM partners and the number of our PBM partners may even decline. Our three largest PBM partners accounted for 61% of our revenue in 2018, 55% of our revenue in 2019 and 42% of our revenue in 2020. For additional information, see “We rely on a limited number of industry participants.” in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technology platform, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We protect our intellectual property, including our brand, through a combination of trademarks, patents, trade secrets, contractual provisions that restrict partners from infringing on our intellectual property, intellectual property assignment agreements, licensing agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as our position as the largest healthcare-focused internet platform for prescription prices and discounts, our scale and the network effects enabled by these factors, as well as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success.
 17

As of December 31, 2020, we owned three issued patents and four pending patent applications in the United States. One issued patent relates to our ability to combine prices from multiple PBMs together in a single consumer interface. Our issued patents begin expiring in 2034, excluding any patent term adjustment. As of December 31, 2020, we held 9 registered trademarks in the United States, including trademarks for our brand, GoodRx, and for the use of the color yellow in the prescription discounts space. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.goodrx.com and www.heydoctor.com.
 We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property and we intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or that it will provide any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products and technology. Our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, it may be difficult to protect our trade secrets. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, they may be inadequate and can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for violations of such measures. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding risks related to intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 Data Protection
 The data we collect and process is an integral part of our products and services, allowing us to ensure our prices are accurate, provide an engaging consumer experience, surface the most relevant prices and reach and advertise to consumers with relevant information. We do not sell personal information as part of our business model.
 We collect and may use personal information to help run our business (including for analytical and marketing purposes) and to communicate and otherwise reach our consumers. In some instances, we may use third party service providers to assist us in the above.
 We endeavor to treat our consumers’ data with respect and maintain consumer trust. We provide our consumers with options designed to allow them to control their data, such as allowing our consumers to opt out of any marketing requests, opt out of the use of marketing cookies, pixels and technologies on our platform, and request deletion of their data. Our privacy and security teams are devoted to processing and fulfilling consumer requests regarding access to and deletion of their data.
 Our respect for laws and regulations regarding the collection and processing of personal data underlies our strategy to improve our customer experience and build trust. To read more about our approach to privacy laws and the regulations, please see “—Government Regulation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security, advertising and consumer protection laws, regulations, standards and other requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
 Philanthropy
 Philanthropy is not a separate initiative at GoodRx; helping others is woven throughout everything we do. Since inception, our aim has been to help Americans get the healthcare they need at a price they can afford, and our team of medical health professionals, public health experts and passionate people ensures that we never lose sight of that goal. We are fortunate to be in a position where helping others also supports our business, which in turn allows us to help even more people in more profound ways. It is a virtuous cycle.
 18

We are especially focused on the massive disadvantages in care that plague communities of color in America. Across the board, minorities score worse on healthcare access and outcomes. This is simply unacceptable. We use our marketing resources, physician relationships and industry connections to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.
 Throughout our history, we have provided charitable support to communities, individuals, students, clinics and non-profits in furtherance of that goal. We have sent employees to hurricane-damaged Houston to provide direct support, provided scholarships for pharmacy professionals and delivered food to low-income populations, among many other projects. We frequently provide direct financial support to individuals, families and organizations who simply need help.
 In 2020, we launched GoodRx Helps, a free medication program, that expects to partner with healthcare professionals and clinics across America. This program purchases and provides more than 500 different medications to patients through nationwide clinic partnerships. In furtherance of this commitment, in December 2020, we issued 1,075,000 shares of our Class A common stock with an estimated fair value of $41.7 million to a charitable organization to fund and support our philanthropic initiatives. 
 Our People and Culture
 Our people are essential to our success. We have a strong track record of selectivity and retention. In both 2019 and 2020, the Los Angeles Business Journal rated GoodRx as one of the Best Places to Work. We were also named as the Best Company Culture, Best Companies for Women, Best Companies for Diversity, and Best CEOs by Comparably, a workplace culture data and ratings service, in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 As of December 31, 2020, GoodRx employed 478 employees, of which 450 were full-time, 23 were part-time and 5 were temporary employees. Of our total employees, 358 were based at our headquarters in Santa Monica, California. Our employees are split among the following departments and functions: 47 worked in customer service and telehealth, 291 in product development and technology, 96 in sales and marketing, and 44 in general and administrative functions. 
 We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions to continue to bolster various functions related to our operations as a publicly traded company, as well as other functions, to support our expected growth. We pride ourselves on hiring people who not only have the skills required to perform their respective roles, but also share in the mission to help Americans get the healthcare they need at a price they can afford. 
 We strive to recruit, hire and retain a talented and diverse team of people. GoodRx has a strong employee referral program, which is a leading source of new hires. We focus on diversity and inclusivity in both hiring and promotion, and are working on initiatives from minority internships to reviews of our compensation practices. We prioritize providing a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where our people are provided with opportunities to pursue career paths based on skills, performance and potential.
 In managing our business, we strive to develop and implement policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among the Company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. Our employees are supported with training and development opportunities to pursue their career paths and to ensure compliance with our policies. We adhere to our business code of conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect.
 In addition to providing challenging and engaging work, we also provide robust benefits, including health insurance for employees and dependents, which include options that are fully funded by GoodRx, 401(k) match, fertility benefits, paid parental leave and discretionary vacation. We foster a tight-knit corporate culture through company events, team building offsites, weekly happy hours, game and movie nights, and pet-friendly offices. The biggest perk of all is knowing that the work performed has a meaningful impact on our consumers.
 19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking necessary actions to safeguard the health of our employees. Steps we have taken include enhancing office safety measures, encouraging hygiene practices advised by health authorities, restricting non-essential business travel, and encouraging remote working for all of our employees. We continue to actively monitor risks related to COVID-19 and proper application of our safety protocol to remain aligned with federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and guidelines. We are committed to providing consistent, transparent communication to employees around safe practices, quarantine and testing protocols, vaccine availability, and timing of safely returning to office work. We believe that our business continuity plan and technology platform will continue to support the effectiveness of our employees working remotely.
 Government Regulation
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 The data we collect and process is an integral part of our products and services, allowing us to ensure our prices are accurate, surface the most relevant prices and reach and advertise to consumers with savings information. We collect and may use personal information to help run our business (including for analytical and marketing purposes) and to communicate and otherwise reach our consumers. In some instances, we may use third party service providers to assist us in the above.
 We endeavor to treat our consumers’ data with respect and maintain consumer trust. We provide consumers options designed to allow them to control the use and disclosure of their data, such as allowing consumers to opt out of any marketing requests, opt out of the use of marketing cookies, pixels and technologies on our platform, and request deletion of their data.
 Since we receive, use, transmit, disclose and store personally identifiable information, including health-related information, we are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations that address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure and protection of certain types of data. Such regulations include the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, HIPAA, Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and, as of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which could result in legal remedies that could materially impact our business or financial performance.
 Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and advertising. In June 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Further, many similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. For instance, the state of Nevada enacted a law that went into force on October 1, 2019 and requires companies to honor consumers’ requests to no longer sell their data.
 20

Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue, we may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the FTC violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.
 In addition, HIPAA, which we believe does not currently apply to most of our business as currently operated, imposes on entities within its jurisdiction, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
 State Licensing Requirements
 Certain states have enacted laws regulating companies that offer and market discount medical plans, including prescription drug plans, subscription membership programs or discount cards, such as our prescription offering, Gold, Kroger Savings, and any other subscription products we may develop in the future, including with respect to our telehealth business. These state laws are intended to protect consumers from fraudulent, unfair or deceptive marketing, sales and enrollment practices by such plans. It is possible that other states may enact new requirements or interpret existing requirements to include our programs. Failure to obtain the required licenses, certifications or registrations to offer and market these subscription discount programs may result in civil penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders, or a restructuring of our operations.
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Laws
 With respect to our telehealth platform, GoodRx Care contracts with physician-owned professional entities to deliver our telehealth offerings to their patients in the United States. We enter into management services agreements with these physician-owned professional entities pursuant to which we provide them with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other services, and they pay us for those services. In addition, our platform enables GoodRx Care consumers to opt in to use our prescription offering and/or fill their prescriptions through a third-party mail-order pharmacy. These relationships are subject to various state laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment, and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or a restructuring of our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Although the consumers who use our offerings do so outside of any medication or other health benefits covered under their health insurance, including any commercial or government healthcare program, we may nonetheless be subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
 21

The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
 The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
 22

Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is cost containment. In the United States, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, including the costs of medication. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient medication coverage under Medicare Part D; and subjected pharmaceutical manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical manufacturers’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and the U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the ACA in its entirety, although it is unclear when or how the Supreme Court will rule.
 In addition, there has been heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, including legislative proposals that call for increasing pharmaceutical manufacturer competition, increasing the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, capping Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, eliminating tax deductions for drug advertising costs, and placing limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Although the likelihood of success for these and other proposals is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration, any such federal and state healthcare reform measures could impact the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services or require us to restructure our existing arrangements with PBMs and pharmaceutical manufacturers, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
