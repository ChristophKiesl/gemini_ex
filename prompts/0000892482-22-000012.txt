ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Qumu Corporation ("Qumu", "Company" or "we") provides the tools to create, manage, secure, distribute and measure the success of live and on-demand video for enterprises. The Qumu platform enables global organizations to drive employee engagement, increase access to video, and modernize the future workplace by providing a more efficient and effective way to share knowledge. Qumu’s customers, which include some of the world’s largest organizations, leverage the Qumu platform for a variety of cloud, on-premise and hybrid deployments. Use cases include, but are not limited to, CEO and executive town halls, self-service webcasting, sales enablement, training, employee onboarding, internal communications, product releases and training, regulatory compliance and customer engagement. The Company and its channel partners market Qumu’s products to customers primarily in North America, Europe and Asia.
The Company generates revenue through the sale of enterprise video content management software, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and services. Software sales may take the form of a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS), recurring term software license or perpetual software license. Software licenses and appliances revenue includes sales of perpetual software licenses, recurring term software licenses and hardware. Service revenue includes SaaS subscriptions, maintenance and support, and professional services. An individual sale can range from a single year agreement for thousands of dollars to a multi-year agreement for over a million dollars. During 2021, SaaS revenue increased 35% compared to 2020, as the Company's sales and marketing efforts and strategic plan focused on growing Qumu's SaaS business. 
The table below describes Qumu’s revenues by category (dollars in thousands):

Enterprise Video Content Management and Delivery Software
To increase communication, engagement and collaboration between employees and stakeholders, organizations are accelerating technology investments to improve the engagement and connectivity of remote work forces, offices, conference rooms, computers and portable devices. As part of this shift in technology investment, enterprises are quickly embracing video as the primary communication and collaboration medium. 
Qumu is a leading provider of best-in-class tools to create, manage, secure, distribute and measure the success of live and on-demand video for the enterprise. As a trusted adviser to clients and partners, Qumu is an innovation leader when scalability, reliability and security are critical. Backed by one of the most talented and experienced teams in the industry, the Qumu platform enables global organizations to drive employee engagement, increase access to video and modernize the workplace by providing a more efficient and effective way to share knowledge. We integrate with and extend the reach of video conferencing solutions such as Zoom, WebEx and Microsoft Teams and support the distribution of video via collaboration tools such as Slack.
Many of the world’s largest organizations leverage the Qumu platform for a variety of cloud, on-premise or hybrid deployments. These uses include executive webcasting, corporate communications, training and onboarding, employee collaboration, external sales, marketing communications, collaborative captioning and subtitling, and centrally managing content for internet protocol television (iPTV) and digital signage solutions.
Qumu provides an end-to-end solution with an intuitive and rich user experience to create, manage and deliver live and on-demand video content both behind and beyond the secure firewall. 
Capabilities and Products
The Qumu Enterprise Video Platform 
Qumu offers an end-to-end video creation, management and delivery solution for enterprises. The Qumu platform offers a scalable and extensible platform that organizations can use to improve stakeholders’ engagement both internally and externally. 
Qumu’s implementations can range in size from thousands to millions of dollars. The Qumu platform integrates with customers’ existing video services (e.g., videoconferencing systems), SaaS business applications (e.g., Zoom, Cisco WebEx and 

Microsoft Teams) and broader IT infrastructures using Qumu’s extensive application services or "APIs." Deployments range from a single customer location to global infrastructures serving over one hundred thousand corporate employees. Qumu’s solution components are deployed as needed to serve different capabilities of the enterprise video content lifecycle of creating, capturing, managing, delivering and experiencing video content.
The Qumu platform encompasses four distinct elements:
•Video Capture
•Video Content Management
•Intelligent Delivery
•Extensions and Add-Ons
Video Capture
Qumu’s intelligent video capture (sometimes referred to as ingest) dynamically supports video content sources, accommodating a wide variety of video formats. Video conferencing solutions have emerged as a rapidly growing source of video content. These range from popular unified communications solutions such as Zoom, Cisco WebEx, and Microsoft Teams, to hardware-intensive conference room systems, such as Zoom Rooms, Polycom and Cisco.
Qumu brings streaming and video content management to these video communications tools, raising the capabilities that they can bring to the enterprise. As video conferencing becomes a common form of team communication, organizations can record, manage and broadcast these videos live or on demand to hundreds or thousands of employees. Intelligent video capture allows users to record and broadcast using existing video conferencing tools. With one enterprise-wide video management and delivery platform, IT can extend their existing video conferencing system investment and concurrently move forward with new unified communications strategies.
Video Content Management
Organizations use Qumu to centrally manage all live and on-demand corporate video content through a single interface. Qumu’s video content management allows system users to ingest video, create metadata and share content quickly and securely to endpoints with rights and rules management. Some of the platform’s notable functionality includes: 
Creation & Editing
The Qumu platform provides comprehensive, easy-to-use tools to create and edit video from desktop and mobile devices or using conference room and studio systems. The tools can be used across a wide range of applications from creating a simple mobile phone presentation, to editing a video conference recording, to producing a multi-camera town hall event. 
Advanced Analytics
Qumu advanced analytics provide leaders and communications staff with real-time visibility and insights into employee engagement for both live streaming video and video on demand (VOD). Advanced analytics also help IT teams monitor and solve issues with buffering, bit rate and latency across internal networks, VPNs and external CDNs.
Automated Workflows
The Qumu platform allows users to automate processes and comply with policies by creating workflows for content approval, management and viewing rights. Automated workflows can be set for specific types of meeting recordings with disclaimers, security, time of life settings and repurposing parameters.
Security and Access Control
Qumu’s access control model can leverage most major enterprise authentication solutions, securing access to videos, channels and administrative functions. In cases where a corporate authentication service is not available, Qumu provides its own user management tools for user creation, self-registration, approvals and group assignment.
Speech Search
Qumu Speech Search allows organizations to use their video repository for eDiscovery, internal clipping services or simply to find information quickly. Qumu Speech Search can quickly analyze thousands of hours of audio and video, index all spoken words and phrases, and return results beyond what metadata or caption-based searches can provide.
Intelligent Delivery
Qumu provides a diverse, flexible and robust series of solutions for enterprise delivery of live streaming or on-demand video. At the core of the Qumu platform is an intelligent business rules engine and CDN broker. This technology allows organizations to configure and optimize video for their specific offices, mobile users, and various endpoints. 
Qumu’s intelligent delivery supports multiple content delivery network configurations, automatically and intelligently selecting the optimal video quality for a given user, delivering video via eCDN, software CDN, and/or public CDNs. Qumu’s intelligent delivery technology can be deployed as hardware, software or Virtual Machine. Intelligent delivery can be centrally monitored, managed, and updated. 
Extensions and Add-Ons
The Qumu platform is designed to be customizable, enhancing the customer’s enterprise communication and collaboration solution. With its service-based extensible architecture, Qumu’s technology can be built upon by third-party developers. Current integrations and extensions from Qumu and its partners include Zoom, Cisco WebEx, Socialive, CaptionHub, Microsoft Office 365, Teams, SharePoint, Yammer, IPTV, Jive, IBM Connections, Polycom, Hive, Pexip and Citrix.
Extensibility is important for meeting customers who have complex and unique digital environments and for Qumu’s network of partners. Qumu’s open, service-based architecture enables customers to more easily support native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile platforms. The Qumu platform offers robust REST APIs for both user and administrative functions, allowing customers to develop integrations of their own on top of the Qumu platform. At the present time Qumu has available extensions and add-ons for live captioning, speech search, advanced analytics, content syndication, WebRTC and several other functions.
Marketing and Distribution
Qumu’s solutions serve a growing customer base of medium- and large-sized enterprises across a wide range of vertical and horizontal markets, with the five primary markets being 1) Banking, Finance and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Services and Consulting, 4) Telecom and Technology and 5) Biotech and Health Care.
In June 2021, Qumu made the strategic decision to change its go-to-market strategy and place 80% of its focus on channel selling with the remaining 20% on its direct sales. Qumu’s channel partners may offer enterprise customers an integrated suite of software that includes the Qumu platform or may offer enterprise customers the Qumu platform as a video solution to be integrated into the customer’s existing enterprise software architecture. Accordingly, our sales and marketing organization is primarily focused on expanding Qumu’s partner network and strengthening marketing support for new partners. 
Qumu, directly and through its channel partners, targets end-customer enterprises with 5,000+ employees. Across all deployment types (cloud, on-premise and hybrid) and in all five markets, Qumu’s customers include many of the largest Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies.
Qumu has been identified as a leader by multiple industry analysts, some examples of which include:
•Aragon Research named Qumu a leader in the 2022 Research Globe for Enterprise Video for the seventh time
•Qumu named a finalist in 2021-22 Cloud Awards in the category of Software as a Service for the enterprise
•Qumu wins second consecutive Stevie Award for Customer Service Department of the Year
•Qumu honored as a TMCnet Remote Work Pioneer Award Winner in the advancement of remote working software
•Aragon Research named Qumu a leader in the 2021 Research Globe for Enterprise Video for the sixth time
•Wainhouse Research named Qumu a top end-to-end streaming in the 2021 State of the Market – Enterprise Streaming Solutions and Services report
•Aragon Research named Qumu a contender in the 2021 Aragon Research Globe for Video Conferencing for the third straight year, demonstrating the platform’s ability to deliver reliable, secure enterprise video at scale beyond the meeting.
As indicated by these honors, we believe Qumu is among the leading enterprise video platform vendors in the space.
Qumu sells products and services internationally through its U.S. operation and its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan. International sales comprised approximately 34%, 31% and 35% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because of the variability in type and size of direct enterprise or channel partner sales, certain customers from time to time may constitute a significant portion of Qumu’s sales for a particular period. As Qumu emphasizes 

channel partner sales, Qumu’s sales may become concentrated among the current channel partners until Qumu expands its channel partner network.
Competition
Major competitors of Qumu include Kaltura, Brightcove, Vbrick and Vimeo. Qumu competes with these other companies based primarily upon its full-stack, end-to-end solution for a complete video infrastructure that includes support for mobile devices and leverages existing IT infrastructure. Qumu also encounters organizations utilizing Zoom, Cisco’s WebEx and Microsoft’s Teams and Streams technologies for video. While some view Zoom, WebEx and Teams as competitors to Qumu and some customers view their products as a partial alternative to Qumu’s technology, their focus is individual and workgroup video conferencing. We believe that the Zoom, WebEx and Teams and Qumu technologies can be seamlessly integrated and provide the customer with greater scale, security and flexibility and improved manageability than use of those technologies alone. Further, because some prospective customers may choose to rely upon their own IT infrastructure and resources to manage their video content, we compete with customer-created solutions for video content management. 
Qumu also differentiates itself from competitors through its agnostic video delivery technology, as well as its flexible deployment models—cloud, hybrid, and on-premise—which Qumu customers can choose from and customize based on their own unique organizational needs for video. Qumu is considered highly reliable and the low-risk choice for many large enterprises.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed 28 employees in research and development. This staff engages in research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products. In addition, Qumu partners with third parties to utilize their competencies in creating products to enhance its product offerings.
Intellectual Property
Qumu currently maintains four U.S. patents and recently submitted one new patent application. The Company's patents have a duration of 20 years and expire from 2031 to 2033. Further, Qumu protects the proprietary nature of its software primarily through copyright and license agreements. It is Qumu’s policy to protect the proprietary nature of its newly developed products whenever they are likely to become significant sources of revenue, including preparing and filing new patent applications where warranted. No assurance can be given that Qumu will be able to obtain patent or other protection for its products. In addition, Qumu has registered and may in the future register trademarks and other marks used in its business.
Qumu also licenses or purchases the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate Qumu to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by the software using those programs. Contractual obligations with respect to such licenses will require cash payments of $100,000 in 2022.
As the number of Qumu’s products increases and the functionality of those products expand, Qumu believes that it may become increasingly subject to attempts by others to duplicate its proprietary technology and to the possibility of infringement of its intellectual property. In addition, although Qumu does not believe that any of its products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may in the future claim, Qumu’s products infringe on their rights and these third parties may assert infringement claims against Qumu in the future. Qumu may litigate to enforce its intellectual property rights and to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of Qumu’s proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against Qumu could involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require Qumu to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent Qumu from developing, selling or using its products. 
The Company is the owner of various trademarks and trade names referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including: "Qumu," "Enterprise Video as a Service (EVaaS)", "VideoNet Edge," "Pathfinder" and "How Business Does Video." Solely for convenience, the trademarks and trade names in this Report are referred to without the ® and TM symbols, but such references should not be construed as any indicator that the Company or the other respective owners will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, its or their rights thereto.
Regulation of Our Product
Qumu is subject to several U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations relating to the operation of our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, data security, intellectual property, competition, anticorruption protection, export controls, online payment services, labor and employment and other matters relating to general business operations. Many laws and regulations to which the Company is subject are still evolving, particularly in the privacy and data protection area, and are being tested in practice and in domestic and international judicial tribunals. In addition, such laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied inconsistently country to country or in the U.S. state to state. As a result, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations creates some uncertainty, particularly relating to our rapidly evolving industry and given the new challenges relating to remote work in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the untested application, ongoing evolution and interpretation of these regulations, we may incur increased compliance costs, we may incur increased research and development costs to enhance our products and services, and/or our products and services may not at all times be in full compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.
For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which took effect in May 2018, the United Kingdom’s transposition of GDPR into its domestic laws post Brexit in January 2021, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect in January 2020, apply to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. the United Kingdom and California, respectively. These laws impose enhanced data protection requirements on companies, including Qumu, that receive or process the personal data of people in the relevant geographies. The Company may be subject to substantial monetary sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new privacy and data security obligations or limitations affecting our business and our products.
These and other laws create an increasingly complex framework and set of compliance obligations which may impact Qumu and its customers. Our failure to comply with applicable privacy or data security laws, regulations, and policies, or to protect personal data, or perception of the same, could result in possible enforcement and legal actions and significant penalties against the Company, which could result in negative publicity, increased costs, lost revenue, and/or have a material adverse effect on Qumu’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company is also aware of increased scrutiny on Qumu’s customer base in regulated industries such as banking, insurance and healthcare concerning data protection and privacy and this has led to more complex customer negotiations and onboarding processes as we are required to provide these organizations with sufficient comfort in our compliance and security procedures. Privacy and data security concerns are also factors that may affect a potential customer’s decision to subscribe to our products and services. To the extent we are unable to meet with our customers’ data protection and security contract requirements, we may lose the customer opportunity or, in the case of an existing customer, we could face claims by, loss of revenue from, loss of confidence, or other adverse consequences from our customers.

Human Capital
Qumu’s single most important and valuable resource is its people. Ensuring a happy, engaged and productive workforce is paramount to the Company’s success and Qumu is committed to creating a culture of engagement, integrity, diversity, professional development, transparency and accountability. Qumu offers a variety of programs and benefits to create a compelling value proposition for attracting and retaining qualified employees. The Company’s "Work from Wherever, Whenever" policy allows Qumu to attract and retain top notch talent without geographic limitations. This program remains a significant recruitment and retention tool for our key talent.
Diversity and Inclusion: Talent unbridled by geographic limitations also creates the opportunity for greater diversity. Qumu is dedicated to increasing diversity of its workforce and working with partners who emphasize the importance and benefits of a diverse workforce. In 2020, Qumu established a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I") Committee comprised of employees from all functions and levels of the company and continued to expand that program in 2021. The Committee is charged with recommending and helping implement Qumu’s DE&I vision to ensure Qumu is leveraging a diverse set of viewpoints, perspectives and skills sets to make Qumu a stronger and more inclusive enterprise. In 2021, among other things, the Committee brought in several guest speakers and has been leveraging a diversity consultant to help support and grow the program and its impacts. Beginning in February 2021, the Governance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of Qumu’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) programs, including DE&I initiatives. We believe this Governance Committee level of oversight demonstrates Qumu’s commitment to achieving diversity and inclusiveness. In addition, in furtherance of Qumu’s commitment to DE&I, Qumu adopted Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging as one of its new key six core values.

Professional Training: Qumu believes in regular and ongoing compliance and professional training launched a new mandatory training program for all employees in 2021, covering among other things, training on discrimination and harassment, DE&I, insider trading, data security, and anti-corruption. Qumu is committed to offering opportunities for professional training and ensuring compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Finally, our focus on training is key to our people strategic pillar ensuring we have happy and healthy employees that want to stay and grow at Qumu.
Health and Wellness: With the increase in remote work, in particular due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Qumu has adjusted its approach to interacting with employees and has focused on new health and wellness initiatives to ensure employees remain healthy and productive as they conduct their work. Some of these measures include communicating appropriate social distancing and mask wearing guidelines consistent with state and CDC guidance; leveraging multimedia communications, including video, to conduct most daily business operations, and weekly tips and guidance on maintaining both physical and mental health.
In addition, in 2020, Qumu closed its three major physical office locations, consistent with its "Work from Wherever, Whenever" policy. Our employees are able to work from just about any location within our current footprint, and they can apply through an internal process to change geographic locations, which affords them a greater work-life balance.
Culture and Values: The successful business operation and reputation of Qumu is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of its employees. We believe it is essential for each of our directors, officers, employees and other representatives to act at all times with honesty and propriety, to exercise good judgment and to conduct business in a manner that such action can be supported without reservation or apology.
Qumu maintains a code of business ethics applicable to all directors, officers, employees and other representatives of Qumu. The Company’s third-party partners, vendors and suppliers are informed of these code requirements and we endeavor to incorporate key elements of such requirements into our contracting process. 
In addition, Qumu maintains a set of key core values that reflect who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our customers, partners, suppliers, and shareholders. These core values include:
•Be Customer Obsessed
•Have a Bias for Action 
•Commit to Personal Ownership and Accountability 
•Build Trust and Transparency
•Empower each other through Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
•Practice Intentional Innovation
The continued success of Qumu is dependent upon our customers’ trust, and we are dedicated to preserving that trust. Qumu’s expectation is that employees will use good judgment and respond to each situation in an ethical and legal manner consistent with these core values.
Competitive Pay and Benefits: Qumu is committed to providing a total compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward quality employees who must operate in a highly competitive, high growth, tech/SaaS environment. We do this by making available multiple compensation elements aligned with overall company performance, including both cash and equity components depending on employee level and role. The emphasis on overall company performance aligns each employee’s financial interests with Company results and the interests of our shareholders.
Qumu’s commitment to providing comprehensive benefit options include periodic reviews of benefits with a focus on offering benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Examples of benefits offered include: Qumu’s "Work from Wherever, Whenever" policy, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, paid parental leave, adoption reimbursement, unlimited PTO for exempt employees, availability of legal services, identity theft insurance, emergency travel assistance, employee assistance program, 401(k) with company match, “Work from Wherever, Whenever” equipment supplied along with a monthly stipend.
Employee Recruitment: Attracting the best talent is a core priority at Qumu. The Company leverages a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We use various online recruiting platforms, social media platforms and specialized recruiters as appropriate, as well as internal employee networks and referrals, which is one of our most prolific recruiting assets. Qumu has implemented a robust internal recruiting and employee referral program where employees receive financial rewards for referrals that are hired and remain with the company for at least one year. 

In addition, through our "Work from Wherever, Whenever" policy, Qumu is able to offer new work opportunities to individuals who, based on location alone, may not have otherwise been eligible for such positions in the past, greatly expanding the pool of great talent available to Qumu and making the opportunities at Qumu more broadly available to a global audience.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 108 employees, all of which were full-time employees and of which 28 were involved in research and development, 43 in sales and marketing, 22 in service and support and 15 in administration and management. Of the 108 employees, 64 reside in North America, 27 reside in Europe and 17 reside in India. Of this headcount, 28 were comprised of women and 23 were considered diverse from an ethnicity perspective based on country. 
Our diversity numbers as of December 31, 2021 reflect 26% women and 21% ethnic/racial diversity. Our employees located in India are all considered Indian nationals and therefore do not meet the definition of diverse in India and therefore are not included in the noted percentage.
