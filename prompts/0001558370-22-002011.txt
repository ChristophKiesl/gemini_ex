Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
General. S|T|O|R|E is an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is a leader in the acquisition, investment and management of Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, or STORE Properties, which is our target market and the inspiration for our name. A STORE Property is a real property location at which a company operates its business and generates sales and profits, which makes the location a profit center and, therefore, fundamentally important to that business.
S|T|O|R|E is one of the largest and fastest-growing net-lease REITs and our portfolio is highly diversified. As of December 31, 2021, our 2,866 property locations were operated by 556 customers across the United States. Our customers operate across a wide variety of industries within the service, retail and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy, with restaurants, early childhood education, metal fabrication, automotive repair and maintenance and health clubs representing the top industries in our portfolio.

The following table depicts the growth in our investment portfolio since our inception in 2011.
Our Total Investment Portfolio at Period End
​
Taxation as a Real Estate Investment Trust. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2011. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. 
The Net-Lease Model and Sustainability. S|T|O|R|E is a net-lease REIT. Accordingly, we acquire STORE Properties from business owners, and then lease the properties back to the business owners under net-leases, substantially all of which are triple-net. Under a triple-net lease, our customer (the tenant) is solely responsible for operating the business conducted at the property subject to the lease, keeping the property and improvements in good order and repair, remodeling and updating the building as it deems appropriate to maximize business value, and paying the insurance, property taxes and other property-related expenses. Under the triple-net lease model, therefore, S|T|O|R|E is not a real estate operator; rather, we provide real estate financing solutions to customers seeking a long-term, lower-cost alternative to real estate ownership. Following our acquisition of a property, it is our customer, and not S|T|O|R|E, that controls the property, including with respect to decisions as to when and how to implement environmentally sustainable practices at a given property. However, as the property owner, we nevertheless recognize that the operation of commercial real estate assets can have a meaningful impact on the environment, particularly with respect to resource consumption and waste generation, and on the health of building occupants. Accordingly, at S|T|O|R|E, we believe that being conscious of, and seeking to address, environmental impacts within our control, and supporting our tenant customers to do the same in their businesses, plays a role in building and sustaining successful enterprises and, thus, is material to the success of our own business.

Our Corporate Responsibility. We define success by our ability to make a positive difference for all of our many stakeholders. S|T|O|R|E’s beginning was inspired by our belief that we could make a positive difference for real estate intensive businesses across the U.S. by delivering innovative and superior real estate capital solutions. That belief has guided our efforts to bring much needed capital and liquidity opportunities to middle-market and larger businesses which, in turn, have brought value creation and growth to our most integral stakeholders: our customers, stockholders and employees. For our many customers, S|T|O|R|E’s real estate lease solutions have contributed to their prospects for wealth creation and to their ability to grow, create jobs and contribute to many communities across the country. In turn, meeting the needs of our customers provides an extraordinary investment opportunity that we believe holds the promise of sustainable long-term wealth creation for our many stockholders. We are committed to operating our business responsibly,

Our Target Market
We are a leader in providing real estate financing solutions principally to middle-market and larger businesses that own STORE Properties and operate within the broad-based service, retail and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy. We have designed our net-lease solutions to provide a long-term, lower-cost way to improve our customers’ capital structures and, thus, be a preferred alternative to real estate ownership. We estimate the market for STORE Properties to approximate $3.9 trillion in market value and to include more than 2.0 million properties.

We define middle-market companies as those having approximate annual gross revenues of between $10 million and $1.0 billion, although approximately 21% of our customers have annual revenues in excess of $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2021, the median annual revenues of our 556 customers was approximately $62 million and, on a weighted average basis, our average customer had revenues of approximately $1 billion. Most of our customers do not have credit ratings, although some have ratings from rating agencies that service insurance companies or fixed-income investors. Most of these non-rated companies either prefer to be unrated or are simply too small to issue debt rated by a nationally recognized rating agency in a cost-efficient manner.
The financing marketplace for STORE Properties is highly fragmented, with few participants addressing the long-term capital needs of middle-market and larger non-rated companies. While we believe our net-lease financing solutions can add value to a wide variety of companies, we believe the largest underserved market and, therefore, our greatest opportunity, is non-rated, bank-dependent, middle-market and larger companies that generally have less access to efficient sources of long-term capital.

Our customers typically have the choice either to own or to lease the real estate they use in their daily businesses. They choose to lease for various reasons, including the potential to lower their cost of capital, as leasing supplants traditional financing options that tie up the equity in their real estate. Leasing is also viewed as an attractive alternative to our customers because it generally locks in scheduled payments, at lower levels and for longer periods, than traditional financing options; these factors are viewed favorably relative to the amounts funded.
Whether companies elect to rent or own the real estate they use in their businesses is most often a financial decision. For the few highly capitalized large companies that possess investment-grade credit ratings, real estate leasing tends to be viewed as a substitute for corporate borrowings that they could otherwise access (so long as they remain highly rated and equitized). With real estate leases often bearing rental costs that exceed corporate term borrowing costs, such companies elect to rent for strategic reasons. Such reasons may include the long-term flexibility to vacate properties that are no longer strategic, the permanence of lease capital which lessens potential refinancing risk should corporate credit ratings deteriorate, the lack of corporate financial covenants associated with leasing and the ability to harness developers to effectively outsource their real estate development needs. The primary motivations for S|T|O|R|E’s middle-market and larger customers tend to be different. For such companies, real estate leasing solutions offer the potential to lower their cost of capital. In addition to this primary economic motivation, our tenants also seek lease assignability, property substitution rights, property closure rights and S|T|O|R|E’s assistance with property expansion and lease contract modification. Our real estate leasing solutions offer tenants such flexibility, which, in turn, offers the potential for further tenant wealth creation. We believe that our customers select us as their landlord of choice principally as a result of our service, comparative business flexibility and the tailored net-lease solutions we provide.
We believe the demand for our net-lease solutions has grown, in part, as a result of the current bank regulatory environment. In our view, the increased scrutiny and regulation of the banking industry in response to the collapse of the housing and mortgage industries from 2007 to 2009, particularly the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Basel Accords issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, have constrained real estate lending practices and limited desirable term debt real estate borrowing options. Real estate leasing today represents a highly desirable component of corporate capitalization strategies due, in part, to the unavailability of long-term, fixed rate commercial real estate mortgage financing with important features such as affordable prepayment and modification options or loan assignability.
S|T|O|R|E was formed to capitalize on a large market opportunity resulting from the widespread need amongst middle-market and larger companies for efficient corporate real estate capital solutions. We believe our opportunities include both gaining market share from the fragmented network of net-lease capital providers and growing the market by creating demand for our net-lease solutions that meet the long-term real estate capital needs of these companies.
The estimated $3.9 trillion market of STORE Properties is divided into three primary industry sectors and various industry sub-sectors. The primary sectors and their proportion of this market are service at 47%, retail at 42% and manufacturing at 11%. The sub-sectors included within each primary sector are summarized in the table below.

Service | ​ | Retail | ​ | Manufacturing 
Restaurants | ​ | Big box retail | ​ | Industrial profit-centers
Education | ​ | Specialty retail | ​ | Light manufacturing 
Fitness centers | ​ | Grocery | ​ | ​ 
Automotive services | ​ | Drug stores | ​ | ​ 
Family entertainment | ​ | Automotive (new and used) | ​ | ​ 

​

Within the sub-sectors, the market for STORE Properties is further subdivided into a wide variety of industries within the service, retail and manufacturing sectors, such as:

Automotive parts stores | | Movie theaters 
Cold storage facilities | ​ | Office supplies retailers
Department stores | ​ | Pet care facilities 
Discount stores | ​ | Rental centers 
Early childhood education | ​ | Secondary education 
Family entertainment facilities | ​ | Supermarkets 
Fast food restaurants | ​ | Truck stops 
Full service restaurants | ​ | Wholesale clubs 
Furniture stores | ​ | ​ 

​
Although many of these industries are represented within our diverse property portfolio, S|T|O|R|E primarily targets service sector properties that represent a broad array of everyday services (such as restaurants and early childhood education facilities) that are not readily available online and that are located near customers targeted by the business operating on the property. Although not our primary focus, the retail sector assets we target are primarily located in retail corridors, also tend to be internet resistant and include a high experiential component, such as furniture and hunting and fishing stores. In the manufacturing sector, we typically target properties that represent a broad array of industries, are located in industrial parks near customers and suppliers, and are operated by businesses that produce everyday necessities. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio of investments in STORE Properties was diversified across approximately 120 industries, of which 65% was in the service sector, 15% was in the retail sector and 20% was in the manufacturing sector, based on revenue.
Our Asset Class: STORE Properties
STORE Properties are a unique asset class that inspired the formation of S|T|O|R|E and our company name. STORE (Single Tenant Operational Real Estate) Properties are profit-center real estate locations on which our customers conduct their businesses and generate revenues and profits. The defining characteristic of STORE Properties is the number of sources that support the payment of our rent: STORE Properties have the following three sources, whereas all other commercial real estate assets have just two.

● | Unit-Level Profitability. STORE Properties are distinguished by the primary source that supports the payment of rent, which is the profits produced by the business operations at the real estate locations we own, which we refer to as unit-level profitability. While it is a common perception that the tenant under a lease is the primary source of the rent payment (as distinguished from the business unit operating at the leased site), we have observed a historic pattern in which tenants in corporate insolvencies seek to vacate unprofitable locations while retaining profitable ones, which indicates that the profitability of a property location is the main indicator of a tenant’s long-term ability to pay the rent on that property. Because insolvent tenants historically retain profitable locations while seeking to vacate unprofitable ones, a key component of our business includes requiring our customers to produce and submit to us unit-level financial statements of the businesses they operate at our properties. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of the properties in our portfolio are subject to unit-level financial reporting requirements. Without access to these unit-level financial reports, it is difficult to accurately assess our customer’s business and, thus, the quality of the most important, and primary, source for our rent payments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer Credit Quality. In addition to the unit-level profitability of the businesses operated on the real estate we own, our customers’ overall financial health, or credit quality, serves as a secondary source supporting rent payments. Our customer’s credit can become the primary source if our unit is not profitable and our customer is required to divert cash flows from its other profitable locations or utilize other resources to pay our rents. However, we have seen that customer credit quality tends to be subject to greater volatility over time than unit-level profitability, because customer credit quality is not only a function of the unit-level profitability of the operations at our locations, but also of the profitability of the other properties and assets owned by our customer or other third parties. Corporate financial health is also a function of many other

decisions, such as optional changes in capital structure or growth strategies, as well as conditions in the marketplace for our customers’ products and services, that can change over time and that may have profound impacts on customer creditworthiness.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Real Estate Residual Value. The final source supporting the payment of rent, common to all real estate investments, is the residual value of the underlying real estate, which gives us the opportunity to receive rents from substitute tenants in the event our property becomes vacant. For S|T|O|R|E, this means more than just looking at comparable lease rates and transactions. Studies we have completed underscore the importance of investing in properties at or below their as-new replacement costs. We also review the local markets in which our properties are located and seek to have rents that are at or below prevailing market rents on a per square foot basis for comparable properties. Taking these steps protects S|T|O|R|E and our customers by making it easier for us to assign, sell or sublease properties that our customers may want to sell, reposition or vacate as part of their capital efficiency strategies.

Creating Investment-Grade Contracts
From our inception in 2011, we have emphasized and uniquely disclosed information regarding the net-lease contracts we create with our tenants. We believe that our net-lease contracts, and not simply tenant or real estate quality, are central to our potential to deliver superior long-term risk-adjusted rates of return to our stockholders. Contract quality embodies tenant and real estate characteristics, together with other investment attributes we believe are highly material. Contract attributes include the prices we pay for the real estate we own, inclusive of the prices relative to new construction cost. As of December 31, 2021, our average investment approximated 80% of replacement cost, a statistic that has been relatively stable since 2015. Other important contract attributes include the ability to receive unit-level financial statements, which allows us to evaluate unit-level cash flows relative to the rents we receive. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average ability of the properties we own to cover our rents, which we refer to as the “4-wall coverage ratio,” approximated 4.6:1 (the median 4-wall coverage ratio approximated 3.1:1). In addition, we calculate a coverage ratio, inclusive of an allowance for indirect costs, for each of the properties we own which we refer to as the “unit fixed charge coverage ratio.” As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average unit fixed charge coverage ratio approximated 3.6:1 (the median unit fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.5:1). Likewise, over many years of providing real estate net-lease capital, we have determined that tenant alignments of interest are highly important. Such alignments of interest can include full parent company recourse, credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, cross default provisions and the use of master leases. Master leases are individual lease contracts that bind multiple properties and offer landlords greater security in the event of tenant insolvency and bankruptcy. Whereas individual property leases provide tenants with the opportunity to evaluate the desirability and viability of each individual property they rent in the event of a bankruptcy, master leases bind multiple properties, permitting landlords to benefit from aggregate property performance and limiting tenants’ ability to pick and choose which leases to retain. As of December 31, 2021, 94% of our multi-property net-lease contracts were in the form of master leases. Contract economic terms are also highly important because they can enhance margins of safety. During 2021, our weighted average initial lease rate was 7.5%, with annual contractual lease escalations averaging an added 1.9% of contract rents for new assets added during the year. We believe that our initial yields, on average, range from 10% to 15% above those expected by investors seeking real estate investment opportunities through the broker auction market, which provides us greater flexibility to preserve and enhance returns. Other important tenant contract considerations include indemnification provisions, lease renewal rights, and the ability to sublease and assign leases, as well as qualitative considerations, such as alternative real estate use assessment and the composition of a tenant’s capitalization structure. 
Since our November 2014 initial public offering, S|T|O|R|E’s extensive contract attribute disclosure has uniquely included a tenant credit quality distribution chart, employing computed implied credit ratings applied to regularly received tenant financial statements using Moody’s Analytics RiskCalc. Since tenant credit ratings are merely one component of contract risk, we developed a means to deliver a base quantitative contract quality estimate. Our approach was to modify risk of tenant insolvency, as estimated by the Moody’s algorithm, by our own estimate of the likelihood of property closure, based on the regularly monitored profitability of the properties bound by each lease contract we create. To accomplish this, we established a simple range of property closure likelihood ranging from 10% to 100% based upon property profitability ranges from breakeven to a computed ability to cover our rents twice over. Multiplying tenant estimated insolvency probability (Moody’s Analytics RiskCalc) by our estimate of the probability of property closure results in a contract risk measurement that we call the STORE Score and which we regularly and uniquely disclose.

Our Competitive Strengths
We have a market-leading platform for the acquisition, investment in and management of STORE Properties that simultaneously creates value for stockholders and customers through our five corporate competencies. 

● | Investment Origination. We founded S|T|O|R|E to fill a need for efficient long-term real estate capital for middle-market and larger customers. We do this principally through a solutions-oriented approach that includes the use of lease contracts that address our customers’ needs and that strive to provide superior value for our customers over other financial options they may have to capitalize their businesses. A S|T|O|R|E hallmark is our ability to directly market our real estate lease solutions to middle-market and larger companies nation-wide, harnessing a geographically focused team of experienced relationship managers at our home office. Approximately 80% of our investments, by dollar volume, have been originated by our internal origination team through direct new customer solicitations and a strong level of repeat business from existing customers. By creating demand for our services, we maintain a large pipeline of investment opportunities, which we estimate to be $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our objectives are to be highly selective and to achieve higher rates of return than our stockholders could achieve if they sought to acquire profit-center real estate on their own. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investment Underwriting. Our investment underwriting approach centers on evaluations of unit-level and corporate-level financial performance, together with detailed real estate valuation assessments, which is reflective of the characteristics of the STORE Property asset class. We have combined our underwriting approach with our portfolio management systems to capture and track computed customer credit ratings as well as the performance of the businesses conducted at the properties we own (unit-level performance). Our focus on STORE Properties, which are profit-centers for our tenants, enables us to create lease contracts having payment performance characteristics that are generally materially superior to the implied credit ratings of our diverse tenant base. Through our underwriting and portfolio management approach, we track, measure and report investment performance, with the investment underwriting goal to create a diverse portfolio centered on investment-grade quality contracts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investment Documentation. Because we believe purchase and lease contracts are the principal determinants of investment risk, we have always emphasized the importance of our investment documentation. The purchase documentation process includes the validation of investment underwriting through our due diligence process, which includes our initiation and receipt of third-party real estate valuations, title insurance, property condition assessments and environmental reports. When we are satisfied with the results and outcome of our pre-acquisition due diligence process, we purchase the property under a purchase agreement and enter into a lease with the seller. Our lease documents incorporate lessons learned over decades to forge balanced
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

contracts characterized by important alignments of interest, including strong enforcement provisions. Altogether, our documentation process, like our approach to investment underwriting, is integral to investment quality and designed to offer our investors a value that most could not create for themselves.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Portfolio Management. Net-lease real estate investment portfolios require active management to realize superior risk-adjusted rates of return. S|T|O|R|E is virtually paperless and we can access detailed information on our large diversified portfolio from practically anywhere and at any time, allowing us to monitor unit-level profit and loss statements, customer corporate financial statements and the timely payment of property taxes and insurance in order to gauge portfolio quality. Having such systems is central to our ability to effectively monitor and reduce customer credit risk at the property level, which, in turn, allows us to place greater focus on effectively managing the minority of investments that may have higher risks. We believe these systems, when combined with our high degree of financial and operating flexibility, allow us to realize better stockholder risk-adjusted rates of return on our invested capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial Reporting and Treasury. We consider and evaluate our corporate financing strategies with the same emphasis as our real estate investment strategies. Under our financing strategy, borrowings must: prudently improve stockholder returns; be structured to provide portfolio flexibility and minimize our exposure to changes in long-term interest rates; be structured to optimize our cost of financing in a way that will enhance investor rates of return; and contribute to corporate governance by enhancing corporate flexibility. Our senior leadership team has extensive experience with diverse liability strategies. Today, we are one of the few REITs able to employ our own AAA rated borrowing source, while simultaneously maintaining investment-grade corporate credit ratings. We have designed and implemented strategies that add value to our investors by offering a more efficient means to finance real estate than they could otherwise do on their own. At the same time, the flexibility we derive from our liability strategies can also result in important flexibility for our customers.

Our Business and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to continue to create stockholder value through sustained investment and management activities designed to increase distributable cash flows and deliver attractive risk-adjusted rates of return from a growing, diverse portfolio of STORE Properties. To accomplish this, our principal business and growth strategies are as follows: 

● | Focus on Middle-Market and Larger Companies Operating STORE Properties. We believe we have selected the most attractive investment opportunity within the net-lease market, STORE Properties, and targeted the most attractive customer type within that market, middle-market and larger non-investment-grade-rated companies. We focus on this market given its strong fundamentals and the limited long-term financing solutions available to the companies in it. Within the net-lease market for STORE Properties, our value proposition is most compelling to middle-market and larger, bank-dependent companies, most of which are not rated by any nationally recognized rating agency due to their size or capital markets preferences, but who have strong credit metrics and operate within broad-based industries having the potential for sustained relevance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Realize Stable Income and Internal Growth. We seek to make investments that generate strong and stable current income as a result of the difference, or spread, between the rate we earn on our assets (primarily our lease revenues) and the rate we pay on our liabilities (primarily our long-term debt). We augment that income with internal growth. We seek to realize superior internal growth through a combination of (1) a target dividend payout ratio that permits a meaningful level of free cash flow reinvestment and (2) cash generated from the estimated 1.8% weighted average annual escalation of base rent and interest in our portfolio (as of December 31, 2021, as if the escalations in all of our leases were expressed on an annual basis). We benefit from contractual rent escalations, as approximately 99% of our leases and loans (as of December 31, 2021, by base rent and interest) have escalations that are either fixed (14% of our leases and loans) or based on the Consumer Price Index, or CPI (85% of our leases and loans). A final means of internal growth is the accretive redeployment of cash realized from the occasional sale of real estate. During 2021, we divested real estate which had an initial cost of $368.9 million and collected $356.0 million in proceeds on these sales which we

were able to redeploy. We believe these three means of internal growth will enable strong cash flow growth without relying exclusively on future common stock issuances to fund new portfolio investments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capitalize on Direct Origination Capabilities for External Growth. As the market leader in STORE Property investment originations, we plan to complement our internal growth with external growth driven by continued new investments funded through future equity issuances and borrowings to expand our platform and raise investor cash flows.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Actively Manage our Balance Sheet to Maximize Capital Efficiency. We seek funding sources that enable us to lock in long-term investment spreads and limit interest rate sensitivity. We also seek to maintain a prudent balance between the use of debt (which includes our own STORE Master Funding program, unsecured term notes, commercial mortgage-backed securities borrowings, insurance borrowings, bank borrowings and possibly preferred stock issuances) and equity financing. We are currently rated Baa2, BBB and BBB rating by Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, our secured and unsecured long-term debt had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $4.3 billion, a weighted average maturity of approximately seven years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase our portfolio diversity. As of December 31, 2021, we had invested approximately $10.7 billion in 2,866 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers for our customers. Our portfolio is highly diversified; built on an average transaction size of approximately $9.5 million, we now have over 550 customers (having added an average of approximately 13 net new customers quarterly since inception) operating across approximately 855 different brand names, or business concepts, across 49 states and 120 industry groups. Our largest customer represented 3.0% of our portfolio as of December 31, 2021, based on base rent and interest. Our portfolio’s diversity decreases the impact on us of an adverse event affecting a specific customer, industry or region, thereby increasing the stability of our cash flows. We expect that additional acquisitions in the future will further increase the diversity of our portfolio and, from time to time, we may sell properties in our portfolio to improve overall portfolio credit quality or diversity.

● | Engage with our tenants. Our experienced relationship managers provide tailored lease solutions to our customers that address our customers’ needs and that strive to provide superior value for our customers over other financial options they may have to capitalize their businesses. The direct relationships we develop with our customers give us greater insights into their businesses and allow us to proactively help them grow their businesses or work with them to help solve problems that may arise from time to time. For example, during 2020 and in connection with the shutdowns and other disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked with a number of our tenants on short-term rent deferral arrangements, including through a structured rent relief program under which we allowed such tenants to defer a portion of their rent, with repayment primarily structured through short-term, interest-bearing notes. These efforts allowed our customers to avoid lease defaults while giving their businesses time to recover and gave us the ability to continue to receive our contractual rent.

Beyond our regular engagement with our customers on business matters, in 2019, we initiated a tenant outreach program designed to gauge our tenants’ current sustainability practices, provide them with sustainability education and support resources, and encourage them to engage in sustainable practices, including reducing power usage, saving water, assessing building equipment, and implementing other energy-efficiency upgrades. We believe that effective encouragement of sustainability initiatives, particularly related to energy, water and indoor environmental quality, can lead to the adoption of practices that can drive business and real estate value appreciation, decrease operating costs and mitigate regulatory risks.  

Environmental Stewardship
We are committed to environmental sustainability and the mitigation of environmental risks in connection with the development of our property portfolio. This commitment reflects the fact that the properties we acquire are subject to both state and federal environmental regulations, but, more importantly, it aligns with our belief that being conscious of, and seeking to address and manage, environmental risks within our control, and supporting our customers to do the same in 

10



their businesses, plays a role in building and sustaining successful enterprises; and, thus, is material to the success of our own business.
Our environmental initiatives and partnerships focus on energy savings and carbon footprint reduction in our customers’ facilities. As we are a triple-net lease REIT, without direct control of physical locations, our primary strategy includes educating ourselves and our customers on evolving environmental strategies, soliciting feedback, and gathering environmental data from our customers. This includes developing relationships between our customers and ESG vendor partners, and supporting our tenants in the implementation of green programs including energy efficiency and carbon reduction programs.

As part of our attentiveness to environmental concerns, we:

● | Continuously seek to understand the environmental risks and opportunities associated with our business practices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental awareness among our employees and evaluate opportunities to enhance our processes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promote awareness and engage with our tenants regarding sustainability practices and solutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Process. Our commitment to environmental sustainability begins before we acquire a real estate asset and involves, among other factors, a consideration of the environmental risk associated with our tenants and with prior users of the real estate asset. We then analyze environmental matters in each step of our three-phase property acquisition process: 

● | When assessing a target property, we engage a nationally recognized and insured environmental engineer to perform a Phase I environmental site assessment against current industry standards and evaluate any recognized environmental conditions (RECs) identified in the assessment. We also conduct separate, property-level condition and sustainable practices assessments through an independent third party.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | When we identify a REC, we take appropriate mitigating action, which may include conducting a Phase II environmental assessment, submitting the property into a voluntary clean-up program, purchasing an environmental insurance policy, and remediating the REC in accordance with regulatory requirements,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | When we are satisfied with the results and outcome of our pre-acquisition due diligence process, we purchase the property and enter into a lease with the seller pursuant to which the seller agrees to certain covenants and indemnities that typically require the seller to comply with applicable environmental laws and remediate or take other corrective action should any environmental issues arise.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may take additional actions in situations where a target property may be subject to risks associated with climate change, particularly as a result of being located in a geographic area susceptible to floods, hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes or other climate-related occurrences. These additional steps and actions may include: (i) maintaining comprehensive environmental insurance coverage for specified properties in our portfolio to ensure that there are financial resources available to conduct safe and timely remediation in the event of an unforeseen environmental issue; and (ii) preparing for climate-related natural disasters by requiring our tenants to carry insurance, including fire, wind/hail, earthquake, flood and other extended coverage where appropriate given the relative risk of loss, geographic location and industry best practices.
Building Sustainable Tenant Relationships. Despite owning our properties subject to triple-net leases, under which our tenants control all business operations at the properties, we strive to positively influence the sustainability practices of our tenants. We expect that such efforts will foster relationships with our tenants that effectively encourage sustainability initiatives, particularly related to energy, water and indoor environmental quality, which can lead to the adoption of 

11



practices that should drive business and real estate value appreciation, decrease operating costs and mitigate regulatory risks.
Our primary strategy includes educating ourselves and our customers on evolving environmental strategies, soliciting feedback, and gathering environmental data from our customers. This includes developing relationships between our customers and ESG vendor partners, and supporting our tenants in the implementation of green programs including energy efficiency and carbon reduction programs. To advance this effort, we:

● | Seek out information to help us develop our initiatives by attending conferences and educational webinars and meeting with various ESG experts, consultants and national ESG oriented vendors, with our goal being to have the most current ESG information resources and a strong network of national vendors to meet our customer’s information, consulting and tailored-solution needs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conduct inspections of up to 20% of our properties annually to collect data on types and prevalence of sustainability features implemented at the properties, such as programmable thermostats, LED lighting, energy efficient windows, air filtration and energy efficient water heaters, in order to gauge our performance relative to long-term sustainability initiatives. We initiated our annual property inspection process to aid our portfolio managers and developers in evaluating the sustainability features of existing properties and informing the acquisition analysis process for target properties. We believe our innovative investment analysis process is responsive to increasing market demands for sustainable features in our portfolio properties. We expect that this survey data will provide a baseline framework in which we can develop and improve on the sustainability features already implemented at such properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We supplement our annual property inspections with an annual tenant outreach survey from which we collect further data on sustainability features implemented by our participating tenants at their leased properties and assess our customers’ corporate responsibility priorities, progress and interest in partnering on projects. The data collected from our survey allows us to provide our tenants with education, ideas and support for property-level sustainability solutions, and provides us with a forum to encourage them to pursue sustainable practices and explore technological solutions. This survey has allowed us to engage directly with our tenants most interested in reducing their carbon footprint and related environmental impact and focus our discussions and consultant introductions to those that that best meet the needs and interests of those tenants.
In addition to the survey, we work with ESG vendors and consultants to identify real estate in our portfolio that meets requirements for select initiatives such as solar and electric car chargers. We then proactively reach out to targeted tenants to educate them about the benefits of the select initiative and to assess their interest in learning more and meeting with a consultant for a review of their options. We believe that ongoing tenant engagement and collaboration on environmentally focused property initiatives should create a long-term culture of sustainable tenant relationships.


Human Capital Management
We believe that to continue to deliver strong financial results, we must execute on a human capital strategy that prioritizes, among other things: (i) establishing a work environment that: attracts, develops, and retains top talent; (ii) affording our employees an engaging work experience that allows for career development and opportunities for meaningful civic involvement; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits, and rewarding outstanding performance; (iv) engaging with, and obtaining feedback from, our employees on their workplace experiences; (v) enabling every employee at every level to be treated with dignity and respect, to be free from discrimination and harassment, and to devote their full attention and best efforts to performing their job to the best of their respective abilities; and (vi) communicating with our board of directors on key topics. 
As part of our efforts to achieve these priorities:



● | We seek to foster a diverse and vibrant workplace of individuals who possess a broad range of experiences, backgrounds and skills, starting at the top. At the management level, our non-executive Chairman of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are women and, overall, 37.5% of our board of directors, 40% of our executive officers, and 50% of our officers at the level of senior vice president
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and above are women. We have a deep management bench that, collectively, is fully capable of professionally operating the business and fulfilling the S|T|O|R|E vision.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We empower our employees through employee-run engagement committees that develop and influence new employee onboarding, personal growth and professional development programs, company social and team-building events and health and wellness programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We actively support charitable organizations that promote education and social well-being and we encourage our employees to personally volunteer with organizations that are meaningful to them.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We seek to identify future leaders and equip them with the tools for management roles within our company. Our board periodically reviews with our Chief Executive Officer the identity, skills and characteristics of those persons who could succeed to senior and executive management team positions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2021, we had 117 full-time employees, an increase of 10.4% over the total at December 31, 2020, all of whom are located in our single office in Scottsdale, Arizona. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Competition
We face competition in the acquisition and financing of STORE Properties from numerous investors, including, but not limited to, traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity investors and other institutional investment funds, as well as private wealth management advisory firms that serve high net worth investors (also known as family offices), some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the willingness to accept more risk. We also believe that competition for real estate financing comes from middle-market business owners themselves, many of whom maintain a preference to own, rather than lease, the real estate they use in their businesses. The competition we face may increase the demand for STORE Properties and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us or increase the price we must pay to acquire STORE Properties. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment.
Insurance
Our leases and loan agreements typically require our customers to maintain insurance of the types and in the amounts that are usual and customary for similar commercial properties, including commercial general liability, fire and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies, with commercially reasonable exclusions, deductibles and limits, all as verified by our independent insurance consultant. 
Separately, we purchase contingent liability insurance, in excess of our customers’ liability coverage, to provide us with additional security in the event of a catastrophic claim.

Regulations and Requirements
Our properties are subject to various laws and regulations, including regulations relating to fire and safety requirements, as well as affirmative and negative contractual covenants and, in some instances, common area obligations. We believe that each of our customers has the necessary permits and approvals to operate and conduct their businesses on our properties. Moreover, our properties are subject to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws and regulations (collectively, the “ADA”). Our customers have primary responsibility for complying with these regulations and other requirements pursuant to our lease and loan agreements; however, we may have liability in certain circumstances if our tenants do not comply with such laws and regulations. As of January 31, 2022, we are not aware of any ADA non-compliance that we believe would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
Additionally, our properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may give rise to liabilities related to the presence, handling or discharge of hazardous materials that may emanate from properties that we purchase, regardless of fault. We mitigate the possible liabilities from such laws and regulations by undertaking extensive environmental due diligence and by entering into leases with the sellers of our properties, pursuant to which the sellers agree to certain covenants and indemnities that typically require the sellers to comply with applicable environmental laws 

13



and regulations and remediate or take other corrective action should any environmental issues arise. We believe the costs of capital expenditures related to environmental liabilities will not have a material impact on the results of our operations, as such costs are typically borne by the sellers, previous owners, and tenants of our properties.
