ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K), references to the Company and to we, us, and our refer to BowX Acquisition Corp. 
 General 
 We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 19, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a target business. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we are currently focusing our search for target businesses in the technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) industries. 
 On August 7, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (IPO) of 42,000,000 units (the units and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the units sold, the public shares), at $10.00 per unit, and, on August 13, 2020, pursuant to the underwriters exercise of the full over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of an additional 6,300,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, in total, generating aggregate gross proceeds of $483,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of each of our IPO and the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of an aggregate of 6,933,333 and 840,000 warrants, respectively (the private warrants) at a price of $1.50 per private warrant in private placements to certain of our initial stockholders and certain funds and accounts managed by subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (the BlackRock funds), generating gross proceeds of approximately $11,660,000. 
 Upon the closing of the sale of the units in our IPO and the sale of the private warrants $483.0 million ($10.00 per unit) was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account) located in the United States, which was invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in an open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below. 
 The Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the sale of the units in our IPO and the sale of the private warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a business combination successfully. The Company must complete a business combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on income earned on the trust account and deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of the agreement to enter into an initial business combination. The Company will only complete a business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target business or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity since inception relates to the Companys formation, our IPO and identifying a target business for a business combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the sale of the units in our IPO and the sale of the private warrants. 
 Our Team 
 Our management team is led by Vivek Ranadivé, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Murray Rode, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The two collaborated for over 20 years on the development of TIBCO Software Inc. (TIBCO), a real time integration, process automation and analytics company, to grow it to over $1 billion in annual revenue when it was sold to Vista Equity Partners in 2014 for $4.3 billion.

 Mr. Rode subsequently ran the privately owned business as Chief Executive Officer until mid-2019. While at TIBCO, Messrs. Ranadivé and Rode oversaw the identification and acquisition of approximately 30 technology businesses. While at TIBCO, the two also acquired experience in the telecommunications industry through TIBCOs extensive business with significant customers in such industry. 
 In 2016, Mr. Ranadivé partnered with the University of California (UC) to form Bow Capital Fund I, LP, an early stage venture fund. The relationship with UC gives him unique access to this university system of 10 campuses, 5 medical campuses, 3 national labs, extensive research capabilities (with approximately $5 billion spent per year), and more than 2 million living alumni as strategic partners. We will look to leverage our executive officers access to experts within the UC network for sourcing and diligence of potential opportunities. 
 Our management team consists of seasoned investors and industry executives with an extensive track record of identifying, building, operating, advising, and investing in TMT businesses. The team also has a track record in identifying disruptive technology platforms that have the potential to transform industries. We believe the team will be able to source superior TMT investment opportunities through an extensive network of individuals from private equity, venture capital, growth equity, global corporations, sports and entertainment, and higher education. We believe this network of relationships will provide us access to proprietary and differentiated deal flow. 
 Our Sponsor 
 Our sponsor, BowX Sponsor, LLC (the sponsor) is managed by our executive officers. Non-managing members of our sponsor include certain private funds (the PIMCO private funds) managed by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC. We believe our affiliation with the PIMCO private funds may assist us in sourcing and consummating an initial business combination. However, they have no obligation to assist us in consummating our initial business combination. Additionally, the BlackRock funds have purchased private placement warrants from us in connection with our IPO and will acquire founder shares from Mr. Ranadivé upon consummation of our initial business combination. 
Our Market Opportunity 
 We believe that the entire business ecosystem is ripe for disruption as technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, playing an increasingly dominant role in our daily lives. Technology-based solutions via new-age platforms in social media and cloud computing have become an integral part of society. Over the course of human history, various catalysts have changed the way humans interact with their environment. Civilization 1.0, or The Age of the Artisan, was the period when humans developed more sustainable crops, giving people a consistent level of nutrition not experienced by prior generations of hunter-gatherers. Civilization 2.0 or The Age of the Corporation, refers to the Industrial Revolution, a period that greatly increased the efficiency and output of workers through the use of electricity and large-scale mechanization. We are now in the early stages of Civilization 3.0 or The Age of Data, wherein large amounts of data collected through digital platforms and the internet can be efficiently processed by readily available computing resources. This rapid increase of data and acceleration of processing capabilities, combined with improved connectivity and mobility, is at the center of several tectonic changes in our lives and work. The way we hail a cab, see a doctor and collaborate with colleagues at work, have all been digitized. We believe that digital transformation and Civilization 3.0 are only just beginning and represent the greatest opportunities for innovation and wealth creation since the Industrial Revolution. Our mission is to invest in a technology company that capitalizes on these trends in digital transformation. 
 While this inflection has impacted a very broad range of industries over the last few years, we believe that the recent COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated many of the forces driving digital transformation, and as a result, we foresee increased progress across the digital landscape and significant growth opportunities for those companies who take advantage of the movement. We view this as society, in effect, being sling-shot 3-5 years into the future in terms of our need for and reliance on digital interactions. 
 Some of the themes at play in the current business environment that we aim to capitalize on are as follows: 
 
2 


 Non-linearity in Healthcare: Software technologies, like machine learning, are being combined with advances in medical science to transform peoples ability to live longer, healthier lives. We believe that our management teams relationship with the UC system through Bow Capital Fund I, LP will help us gain access to the pioneers and world experts in these fields. 
 Consumerization & Digitization of the Enterprise: Traditional technology incumbents are losing their foothold as new approaches and technologies, including cloud, open source software, artificial intelligence and edge device computing, disrupt the way technology is purchased and used in the enterprise. We believe our management teams significant operating experience in the space will help capitalize on opportunities. 
 Data-Driven Optimization of Transportation & Logistics: As we enter the Age of Amazon, companies are competing on supply chain, driving new needs for technology to optimize logistics operations. We believe our management teams deep understanding of, and long-standing connections in, the TMT industries will attract quality opportunities. 
 Digital Identity: Digital source of truth for identity and providence are often missing from online social/commerce platforms and, where available, do not translate offline. We believe our management teams extensive network enables connectivity at the regulatory level and issuing nodes for identity. 
 Digitization of Education: Education access via technology enables lifelong and virtual learning to become more prevalent. We believe our management teams network of institutions and advisors will help us uncover and win the best opportunities. 
 The foregoing themes are not intended to be exhaustive. We may pursue an initial business combination with a target business in any industry, sector or geographic location we choose. 
 Our Mission 
 We intend to help TMT businesses drive profitability and growth using our management teams industry expertise and operational practices. While focused on accelerating growth, our management team is also highly considerate of driving profitability to ensure a target business is well-positioned for a self-sustaining growth trajectory and as a result, significant value creation for investors. We will look to leverage our management teams operational practices and industry expertise to unlock long-term and enduring value. By taking a platform minded approach, we will look to accelerate market penetration of a target business both organically and inorganically. 
 Below are a sample of our management teams core values: 
 

 | Excellence: Setting high expectations and goals and seeking to foster a culture of exceptionalism.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Integrity: Valuing honesty and respect, holding each other accountable for actions and commitments. This is intended to help earn the trust and confidence of teammates and partners by upholding our mission and values in every interaction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Openness: An openness to new ideas and people, embracing creativity and risk-taking and welcoming feedback for continuous improvement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Agility: Remaining quick and agile to keep pace with ever changing business environments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Teamwork: Collaborating with others without ego and knowing that winning only occurs through the synergy of the skills and ideas of all participants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Socially Minded: Balancing economic and technological growth with the welfare of society and the environment to influence the absolute good of the whole to better our world.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our mission is to help a target business be innovative in using a digital platform to positively disrupt the industry it operates in, so it can reach its full potential as a growing and profitable operation.

 Acquisition Criteria 
 Consistent with our core values, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 

 | Size: We are focusing on target businesses whose enterprise value is between $1 billion and $3 billion; our management team believes businesses of this size have the right mix of market positioning and potential to scale and grow, while also having profitability potential.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Visible Revenue: We are seeking businesses with models that deliver highly recurring, contracted revenue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong Competitive Position: We are seeking businesses with a first mover advantage or a sizable market share in their segment and the opportunity to achieve market leadership.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proprietary Technology Platform: We intend to identify businesses with defensible proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, which create a competitive moat.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Visionary Management Team: We seek to partner with teams who share our vision for Civilization 3.0 and are able to execute on the market themes; given that we intend to devote significant resources toward reaching alignment with a targets management team and stakeholders, we intend to seek businesses with proven and accomplished management teams that are eager to march forward together with, and benefit from, our management teams expertise.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Scaled, High-growth Asset with Path to Profitability: We are seeking targets that have achieved scale and are on a predictable growth trajectory. Additionally, we seek businesses that are profitable, or have a clear path to profitability, and the ability to grow that profitability over time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Public Readiness: We intend to work with management and stakeholders who aspire to have their business become a public entity and generate substantial growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Appropriate Valuation: Our management team has a background of rigorous due diligence and disciplined, and valuation-centric investing, with a deep understanding of market value. We expect to complete a business combination that results in a strong risk-adjusted return profile with substantial upside potential while limiting downside risks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | M&A Platform: We aim to further increase value by pursuing M&A opportunities. Our management team has significant experience in acquiring target businesses as Mr. Ranadivé and Mr. Rode successfully consummated approximately 30 acquisitions while running TIBCO.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria, and guidelines that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.

 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in our IPO and the sale of the private warrants, shares issued to the owners of the target business, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target business, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for conversions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post- transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We have not selected any business combination target. Accordingly, there is no current basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business. 
 We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in the trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We expect to receive a number of proprietary transaction opportunities to originate as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities of our management team. In addition to the proprietary deal flow, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus from our IPO and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our management team, as well as some of their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our initial stockholders or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is), except that at the closing of our initial business combination, we may pay a customary financial consulting fee to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates, which will not be made from the proceeds of our IPO held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We may pay such financial consulting fee in the event such party or parties provide us with specific target company, industry, financial or market expertise, as well as insights, relationships, services or resources in order to assess, negotiate and consummate an initial business combination. The amount of any such financial consulting fee we pay will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services for comparable transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. We would disclose any such fee in the proxy or tender offer materials used in connection with a proposed business combination.
 
5 


 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our initial stockholders, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our initial stockholders, officers or directors, or any of their affiliates, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such entity. 
 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target business, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we initially intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive, and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 
6 


 Following our initial business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 Fair Market Value of Target Business 
 Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, we must complete one or more business combinations with target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (net of taxes and excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another valuation or appraisal firm that commonly renders fairness opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq, these rules will not be applicable to us. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public stockholders (the holders of our public shares, including our initial stockholders and management team to the extent our initial stockholders and/or members of our management team purchase public shares, provided that each initial stockholders and member of our management teams status as a public stockholder will exist only with respect to such public shares) own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target business management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target business or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target business, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target business and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common or preferred stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target business in order to consummate such transaction. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target business. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaqs 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 
7 


 
Type of Transaction | WhetherStockholderApproval isRequired | 
Purchase of assets | | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | | No 
Merger of the company with a target | | Yes

Permitted Purchases of, and Other Transactions with Respect to, Our Securities 
 In the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such purchases or other transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such purchases or other transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. 
 In the event that our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A common stock or warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 It is likely that our initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates would identify the stockholders with whom they may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the stockholders contacting us or them directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of public shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our initial stockholders, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination. Our initial stockholders, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.

 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. Except as required by applicable law, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval under stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our initial stockholders will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event that we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our initial stockholders, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. 
 If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to their founder shares, we would need only 18,112,500, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), of the 48,300,000 public shares sold in the IPO to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved. However, because we generally only need a majority of the outstanding shares to be voted in favor of a proposed business combination to have such transaction approved, the number of public shares needed to be voted in favor of any transaction decreases as the overall number of public shares voted decreases. Accordingly, we would need only 3,018,750, or 6.25%, of the 48,300,000 public shares sold in our IPO to be voted in favor of a transaction if only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming the underwriters over-allotment option is not exercised). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, officers and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. 
 Our certificate of incorporation will provide that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. 
 Limitations on Redemptions Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO (Excess Shares) owned by them, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, our certificate of incorporation does not restrict our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until August 7, 2022 to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period or during any extended time that we have to consummate a business combination beyond August 7, 2022 as a result of a stockholder vote to amend our certificate of incorporation (Extension Period), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period. 
 Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period. However, if they acquire public shares in the open market they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period.
 We will not propose any amendment to our certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 7, 2022 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above) we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $1,250,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds from our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be 
 
11 


  substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Our independent registered public accounting firm did not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, nor did the underwriters of our IPO. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share. 
 We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $1,250,000 from the proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $750,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $750,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition 
 
12 


  is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only on the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination and then, only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder has properly elected to redeem, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 7, 2022 or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we have not completed our business combination by August 7, 2022, subject to applicable law. Stockholders who do not exercise their rights to the funds in connection with an amendment to our certificate of incorporation would still have rights to the funds in connection with a subsequent business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. Holders of warrants will not have any rights of proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants.
