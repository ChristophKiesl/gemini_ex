AIR POLLUTION CONTROL
 
Regulations and Markets: Domestic
 
The future growth of our APC technology segment is dependent upon the adoption and enforcement of environmental regulations in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., federal and state laws regulating the emission of NOx are the primary driver in our APC technology segment. The principal regulatory drivers currently in effect are as follows:
Clean Air Act: The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) at levels that are protective of public health with an adequate margin of safety. The six pollutants specified include: Ozone (O3), Particulate Matter (PM), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Lead, and Carbon Monoxide (CO).  The NAAQS provisions require that states comply with ozone and particulate emissions standards.  NOx emissions are a precursor to ozone formation and also contribute to fine particulate emissions (PM2.5).  Since 1990, EPA rules and programs have been established at the regional and federal level to help states in their mission to define and meet their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for attainment.  The NAAQS ground-level ozone standards that were issued in 1997, were made more stringent in 2008 and again in 2015.  EPA has kept the 2020 NAAQS ozone standard at 70 parts per billion, the same limit as 2015.
Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR): The Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), also known as the Regional Haze rule, is part of the Clean Air Act and was finalized in 2005. Under CAVR, certain States are required to submit implementation plans to the EPA to comply with the Regional Haze requirements, and updates are required every five years. A new CAVR was issued in January 2017 which requires states to implement new air pollution controls implementation plans in 2021. The overall obligation of CAVR is to return the US scenic areas to “active” visibility by 2064.
New Unit Permits:  New gas fired units for both electricity generation and industrial use will require BACT as a permit requirement.  SCR technology is very often BACT for NOx, and these permit requirements generate new market opportunities.
Consent Decrees: Consent decree activity through the US Department of Justice or EPA may require emission sources to meet individual requirements. Sources may also agree to specific air pollution requirements with states or environmental groups.
Regulations and Markets: International
 
We also sell air pollution control systems outside the United States, specifically in Europe, Latin America, India (under a license agreement) and in the Pacific Rim. The demand for our technologies comes from specific governmental regulations in NOx and PM emission limits which vary by country. We expect that there will be further opportunities to implement our technologies globally in established as well as new geographies in 2021.
 
The European Union published the BREF (Best Available Reference Technology) emission guidelines in mid 2017 that further lowered emission targets over a span of the next four years. The compliance timeline is expected to be extended due to slow initial adoption. These measures are expected to lower the environmental impact of more than 3,000 large combustion plants throughout the European Union. Moreover, European countries that are not current EU members are expected to adopt these new standards as part of their approach to gain EU membership. Despite the significant expansion of renewable energy throughout Europe, the EU and neighboring states still rely heavily on coal generation to provide a stable base load to their power and heating demands. The BREF guidelines reduce NOx limit values by up to 25% which will require an upgrade of the first-generation NOx abatement systems, and that is expected to present new opportunities for Fuel Tech. However, the pace of implementation will still be dependent on each country's internal processes. European engineering companies are also supplying systems to industrial and utility customers globally. Fuel Tech’s NOx control technologies can be integrated into these systems.
 
The Indian government has adopted a higher NOx emission standard for legacy power plants than what was initially agreed to in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement. As a result, SNCR systems will be limited to WTE / industrial units for the foreseeable future. Particulate Matter (PM) emission reductions continue to be an area of focus in the country and that presents an opportunity for Fuel Tech’s DFGC technology application which involves sulfur trioxide and ammonia injection.  These technologies will be implemented through a collaboration with our local partner ISGEC.
 
Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, particulate emissions due to poor performing ESPs have been gaining attention from local authorities.  Power generators in several countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines are actively looking for corrective options and this presents Fuel Tech with opportunities to bring our DFGC technology to these markets.

● | ULTRA Technology: Our ULTRA® process is designed to convert urea to ammonia safely and economically for use as a reagent in the SCR process for NOx reduction. Recent local objections in the ammonia permitting process have raised concerns regarding the safety of ammonia shipment and storage in quantities sufficient to supply SCR. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has characterized anhydrous ammonia as a Toxic Inhalation Hazard commodity. The safe conversion of urea to ammonia just prior to injection into the flue gas duct is particularly important near densely populated cities, major waterways, harbors or islands, or where the storage or transport of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia is a safety concern. UDI™ Urea Direct Injection systems utilize direct injection of urea reagent without the need for an ammonia injection grid.

APC Competition
 
Competition with our NOx reduction suite of products may be expected from companies supplying SCR Systems, SNCR systems, ESP retrofits and FGC technologies. In addition, we experience competition in the urea-to-ammonia conversion market.
 
The SCR process is an effective and proven method of control for removal of NOx up to 90%. SCR systems have a high capital cost of $300+/kW on retrofit coal applications. Companies including GE, Babcock Power, Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) Company, CECO Environmental and Mitsubishi are active SCR system and reagent feed system providers.
 
The use of both urea and ammonia as the reagent for the SNCR process can reduce NOx by 30% - 70%, depending on a number of factors. Ammonia can be effective on incinerators and on Circulating Fluidized Bed combustion units, but has limited applicability for most utility boilers, where urea is dominant. The ammonia-based systems utilize either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia, both of which are hazardous substances. Competitors for ammonia based SNCR include CECO Environmental, B&W, and Yara, with Hamon and B&W for urea based SNCR systems.
 
ESP retrofit competitors include B&W, Southern Environmental and Hamon.  Flue Gas Conditioning competition includes Wahlco, Inc. and Chemithon, Inc.
 
Lastly, with respect to urea-to-ammonia conversion technologies, our controlled urea decomposition system competes with Hamon and Wahlco, which manufacture a system that hydrolyzes urea under high temperature and pressure.
 
APC Backlog
 
Consolidated APC segment backlog at December 31, 2020 was $5.3 million versus backlog at December 31, 2019 of $9.7 million. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately $3.0 million of the backlog over the next 12 months with the remaining recognized thereafter.
 
FUEL CHEM
 
Product and Markets
 
The FUEL CHEM® technology segment revolves around the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the efficiency, reliability and environmental status of plants operating in the electric utility, industrial, pulp and paper, waste-to-energy, and university and district heating markets.  FUEL CHEM programs are currently in place on combustion units in North America, Mexico and Europe, treating a wide variety of solid and liquid fuels, including coal, heavy oil, black liquor, biomass and municipal waste.
 
Central to the FUEL CHEM approach is the introduction of chemical reagents, such as magnesium hydroxide, to combustion units via in-body fuel application (pre-combustion) or via direct injection (post-combustion) utilizing our proprietary TIFI® technology.  By attacking performance-hindering problems, such as slagging, fouling and corrosion, as well as the formation of sulfur trioxide (SO3), and ammonium bisulfate (ABS), our programs offer numerous operational, financial and environmental benefits to owners of boilers, furnaces and other combustion units.
 
A key market factor for this product line is the continued use of coal for global electricity production.  Coal currently accounts for approximately 21% of all U.S. electricity generation and roughly 33% of global electricity generation.  Major coal consumers include the United States, China and India.  Additional market dynamics include a growing, worldwide utilization of biomass for both steam and electrical production, and the continued use of heavy fuel oil for power generation.  The principal markets for this product line are electric power plants burning coals with slag-forming constituents such as sodium, iron and high levels of sulfur. Sodium is typically found in the Powder River Basin coals of Wyoming and Montana. Iron is typically found in coals produced in the Illinois Basin region. High sulfur content is typical of Illinois Basin coals and certain Appalachian coals. High sulfur content can give rise to unacceptable levels of SO3 formation especially in plants with SCR systems and flue gas desulphurization units (scrubbers).  As coal units strive to compete in electricity supply markets, lower cost, higher slagging fuels can create more operational challenges which TIFI Programs can help mitigate. The current Mexican government is favoring indigenous fuel sources for power generation because the international market for high sulfur fuel oil (what Mexico produces) has been significantly reduced with the adoption of the new International Maritime Organization (IMO) restrictions. Fuel Tech’s TIFI systems can help with SO3 mitigation at these oil fired power generation units.
 
The combination of slagging coals and SO3-related issues, such as “blue plume” formation, air pre-heater fouling and corrosion, SCR fouling and the proclivity to suppress certain mercury removal processes, represents an attractive market potential for Fuel Tech.
 
Sales of the FUEL CHEM products were $14.0 million and $16.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
Competition
 
Competition for our FUEL CHEM product line includes chemicals sold by specialty chemical companies, such as Imerys, Environmental Energy Services, Inc., and SUEZ Water Technologies. No technologically comparable substantive competition currently exists for our TIFI technology, which is designed primarily for slag control and SO3 abatement, but there can be no assurance that such lack of substantive competition will continue.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
The majority of our products are protected by U.S. and non-U.S. patents. We own 47 granted patents worldwide and 3 allowed utility model patents in China. We have 14 patent applications pending: including 5 in the United States and 9 in non-U.S. Jurisdictions.
