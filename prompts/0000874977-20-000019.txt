Item 1. Business
State Auto Financial is an Ohio domiciled property and casualty insurance holding company incorporated in 1990. We are engaged in writing personal and business insurance. State Auto Financial’s principal subsidiaries are State Auto P&C, Milbank and SA Ohio, each of which is a property and casualty insurance company, and Stateco, which provides investment management services to affiliated insurance companies.
State Auto Mutual is an Ohio domiciled mutual property and casualty insurance company organized in 1921. It owns approximately 59.5% of State Auto Financial’s outstanding common shares. State Auto Mutual’s other subsidiaries and affiliates include SA Wisconsin, Meridian Security, Patrons Mutual and the Rockhill Insurers, each of which is a property and casualty insurance company. State Auto Mutual and its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates, along with State Auto Financial’s insurance subsidiaries, pool their respective insurance business under the Pooling Arrangement, as further described below. 
The State Auto Group markets its insurance products throughout the United States primarily through independent agencies, which include retail agencies and wholesale brokers. All of the property and casualty insurance companies in the State Auto Group are admitted insurers, except for RIC, which is a non-admitted insurer. The operations of the State Auto Group are headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.
As previously reported, we have exited our specialty business and we stopped writing this business on a net basis in 2018; as a result, the specialty insurance segment is no longer a reportable segment and is disclosed as "specialty run-off." 
Our Pooled Companies are rated A- (Excellent) by the A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”).
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS
Our reportable insurance segments are personal insurance and commercial insurance (collectively the “insurance segments”). These insurance segments are business units managed separately from each other due to the differences in the types of customers they serve, products they provide or services they offer. Our investment operations is also a reportable segment. See a detailed discussion regarding our segments at Item 7 of this Form 10-K “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The products within each reportable insurance segment are as follows:
•Personal Insurance Segment- personal auto, homeowners and other personal
•Commercial Insurance Segment - commercial auto, small commercial package, middle market commercial, workers’ compensation, farm and ranch and other commercial
PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE
Products offered in our personal and commercial insurance segments are marketed exclusively through retail agents, but the segments are managed separately from each other due to the differences in the types of customers they serve, products they provide or services they offer.
Products
Personal Insurance
In our personal insurance segment, we write standard insurance covering personal exposures to individuals. The primary coverages offered are personal auto, homeowners, and other personal (examples of products included in other personal are dwelling fire, personal inland marine and personal umbrella).
Commercial Insurance
In our commercial insurance segment, we write standard insurance covering small to medium sized commercial exposures. We offer a broad range of coverages including commercial auto, small commercial package, middle market commercial, farm & ranch, workers’ compensation and other commercial (examples of products included in other commercial are commercial inland marine, small commercial package umbrella and middle market commercial umbrella).
Marketing
We market our personal and commercial insurance products through approximately 3,200 retail agencies. We view our retail agents as our primary customers, because they are in a position to either recommend our insurance products or those of a competitor to their customers. We strongly support the independent agency system and believe its maintenance is essential to our present and future success. We continually develop programs and procedures to enhance our agency relationships, including the following: regular travel by senior management and regional office staff to meet with agents in their home states; training opportunities; and incentives related to profit and growth.
We actively help our agencies develop the professional sales skills of their staff. Our training programs include both product and sales training conducted in our corporate headquarters. Further, some of our training programs include disciplined follow-up and coaching for an extended time. In addition, from time to time we provide targeted training sessions in our agents’ offices.
We provide our retail agents with defined travel and cash incentives if they achieve certain sales and underwriting profit levels. Further, we recognize our very top agencies—measured by consistent profitability, achievement of written premium thresholds and growth—as Inner Circle Agencies. Inner Circle Agencies are rewarded with additional incentives.
INVESTMENT OPERATIONS
The primary objectives of our investment strategy are to maintain adequate liquidity and capital to meet our responsibilities to policyholders; grow surplus long term to support the growth of our company; provide a consistent level of income; and manage investment risk. Our investment portfolio is managed separately from that of State Auto Mutual and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and investment results are not shared through the Pooling Arrangement, as described below. Stateco performs investment management services for both us and State Auto Mutual and all subsidiaries and affiliates. Investment policies and guidelines are set for each company through the Investment Committee of its respective Board of Directors.
For additional discussion regarding our investments, including the market risks related to our investment portfolio, see Item 7 of this Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Investment Operations Segment.”
CLAIMS
Our claims and risk engineering (“CARE”) division supports our insurance segments through emphasis on timely investigation of claims, settlement of meritorious claims for equitable amounts, maintenance of adequate case reserves for claims, sharing of relevant information, and control of external claims adjustment expenses. Achievement of these goals supports our marketing efforts by providing agents and policyholders with prompt and effective service.
We employ a specialized claims model that is skills-based and focused on yielding a quality customer experience regardless of the type and severity of the claim. We staff field adjusters in locations where we have size, scale and density of claims whenever possible to control file quality and enhance customer service. In areas where there is not a sufficient volume of claims to warrant staff adjusters, we supplement our field staff with outside adjusters and appraisers who work under our direction.
Claim settlement authority levels are established for each adjuster, supervisor and manager based on their level of expertise. Our claims division is responsible for reviewing the claim, obtaining necessary documentation and establishing loss and expense reserves of certain claims. Generally, property or casualty claims estimated to reach $100,000 or above are sent to specialists for direct handling.
We minimize claim adjusting costs by settling as many claims as possible through our claims staff and, when appropriate, by settling disputes regarding automobile physical damage, bodily injury and property insurance claims through arbitration or mediation. 
In addition to our internal claims adjusters, we utilize third party claims administrators (“TPAs”) to investigate, process and settle certain specialty run-off claims on our behalf. As with our internal claims adjusters, claim settlement authority is established for adjusters, supervisors and managers within each TPA. Claims handling and reporting guidelines are established and provided to each TPA. Members of our internal claims staff perform periodic reviews of individual claim files produced by each TPA for compliance with such established claims handling and reporting guidelines.
We have in-house counsel offices to defend and resolve claims which are in litigation. These offices are strategically placed where we have size, scale and density of legal cases to warrant their existence. We also have a list of highly skilled panel counsel to defend our insureds, when appropriate.
POOLING ARRANGEMENT
Our Pooled Companies pool their respective insurance business in accordance with a quota share reinsurance agreement which we refer to as the “Pooling Arrangement.” In general, under the Pooling Arrangement, State Auto Mutual assumes premiums, losses and expenses from each of the remaining Pooled Companies and in turn cedes to each a specified portion of premiums, losses and expenses based on each of the Pooled Companies’ respective pooling percentages. The balance of the pooled premiums, losses and expenses are retained by State Auto Mutual.
See the detailed discussion of our Pooling Arrangement at Item 7 of this Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Pooling Arrangement.”

MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
Through various management and cost sharing agreements, State Auto P&C provides employees to perform all organizational, operational and management functions for the State Auto Group, while State Auto Mutual provides certain operating facilities, including our corporate headquarters.
Our primary management agreement, which we refer to as the 2005 Management Agreement, renewed for an additional ten-year period on January 1, 2015. If the 2005 Management Agreement was terminated for any reason, we would have to relocate our facilities to continue our operations. See “Properties” included in Item 2 of this Form 10-K.
REINSURANCE
Members of the State Auto Group follow the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of their exposures and paying to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received. Insurance is ceded principally to reduce net liability on individual risks or for individual loss occurrences, including catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge the individual members of the State Auto Group from primary liability for the full amount of limits applicable under their policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the reinsurance ceded. See the detailed discussion of our reinsurance arrangements at Item 7 of this Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Reinsurance Arrangements.”
See “Regulation” in this Item 1 for a discussion of the Terrorism Acts.
LOSS RESERVES
We maintain reserves for the eventual payment of losses and LAE for both reported claims and unreported claims. Loss reserves are management’s best estimate at a given point in time of what we expect to pay to settle all claims incurred as of the 
end of the accounting period, based on facts, circumstances and historical trends then known. During the loss settlement period, additional facts regarding individual claims may become known, and consequently, it often becomes necessary to revise our estimate of the liability. The results of our operations and financial condition could be impacted, perhaps significantly, in the future if our estimate of ultimate payments required to settle claims varies from the loss reserves currently recorded.
Loss reserves for reported claims are initially established on either a case-by-case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the claim. The case-by-case reserve amounts are determined based on our case reserving practices, which take into account the type of risk, the circumstances surrounding each claim and applicable policy provisions. The formula reserves are based on historical paid loss data for similar claims with provisions for changes caused by inflation. Loss reserves for IBNR claims are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information, changes in exposure units, inflation, legal developments, storm loss estimates and economic conditions. Case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis. As new data becomes available, estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves. Generally, reported losses initially reserved on a formula basis which have not settled after six months, are case reserved at that time. Although our management uses many resources to calculate loss reserves, there is no single method for determining the exact ultimate liability. We do not discount loss reserves for financial statement purposes. For additional information regarding our loss reserves, see Item 7 of this Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Loss and LAE.”
The following table sets forth our one-year development information on changes in the loss reserve for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

COMPETITION
The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous insurance companies, with varying sizes and financial resources, in the personal and commercial insurance markets based on the following factors: price; product offerings and innovation; underwriting criteria; quality of service to insureds; relationships with our retail agents and wholesale brokers; prompt and fair claims handling and settlement; financial stability; and technology. In addition, because most of our retail agents and wholesale brokers represent more than one insurer, we face competition within each agency and broker.
REGULATION
Most states, including all the domiciliary states of the State Auto Group, have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in our holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within our holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Pursuant to these laws, the respective insurance departments may examine any members of the State Auto Group, at any time, require disclosure of material transactions involving insurer members of our holding company system, and require prior notice and an opportunity to disapprove of certain “extraordinary” transactions, including, but not limited to, extraordinary dividends to shareholders. Additionally, these laws require that all transactions within our holding company system affecting any insurance subsidiary within the State Auto Group are fair and equitable. In addition, approval of the applicable state insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the control of an insurer. The insurance laws of all the domiciliary states of the State Auto Group provide that no person may acquire direct or indirect control of a domestic insurer without obtaining the prior written approval of the state insurance commissioner for such acquisition.
In addition to being regulated by the insurance department of its state of domicile, each of our insurance companies is subject to supervision and regulation in the states in which we transact business. Such supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of an insurance company’s business operations and financial condition. The primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is to ensure financial stability of insurance companies for the protection of policyholders. The laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad regulatory powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, setting reserve requirements, determining the form and content of required statutory financial statements, prescribing the types and amount of investments permitted and requiring minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. Although premium rate regulation varies among states and lines of insurance, such regulations generally require approval of the regulatory authority prior to any changes in rates. In addition, all of the states in which the State Auto Group transacts business have enacted laws which restrict these companies’ underwriting discretion. Examples of these laws include restrictions on policy terminations, restrictions on agency terminations and laws requiring companies to accept any applicant for automobile insurance. These laws may adversely affect the ability of the insurers in the State Auto Group to earn a profit on their underwriting operations.
The Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act (“ORSA”), adopted by the NAIC in 2012, requires insurers to incorporate a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework within company operations. Overall, ORSA is an internal assessment of the risks associated with an insurer’s business and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. Each insurer’s ORSA process will be unique, reflecting its business, strategy and approach to enterprise risk management. In 2019, the State Auto Group filed its ORSA Summary Report, supported by internal risk management materials, with the Ohio Department of Insurance, our lead state regulator.
We are required to file detailed annual reports with the supervisory agencies in each of the states in which we do business, and our business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time.
There can be no assurance that such regulatory requirements will not become more stringent in the future and have an adverse effect on the operations of the State Auto Group.
Dividends. Our insurance subsidiaries generally are restricted by the insurance laws of our respective states of domicile as to the amount of dividends we may pay without the prior approval of our respective state regulatory authorities. Generally, the maximum dividend that may be paid by an insurance subsidiary during any year without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of a stated percentage of that subsidiary’s statutory surplus as of a certain date, or adjusted net income of the subsidiary for the preceding year. Under current law, $91.3 million is available in 2020 for payment as a dividend from our insurance subsidiaries to STFC without prior approval from our respective domiciliary state insurance departments. STFC received dividends of $10.0 million, $10.0 million and $15.0 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from its insurance subsidiaries. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions can be found in this Item 7 and in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
Rates and Related Regulation. Except as discussed below, we are not aware of the adoption of any material adverse legislation or regulation in any state in which we conducted business during 2019 which would materially impact our business.
Many states in which we operate have passed or are considering legislation restricting or banning the use of credit scoring in the rating and risk selection process. Some states are also becoming active in questioning the use of catastrophe modeling in the pricing and underwriting areas. Regulation risk is realized when states do not approve or limit the amount of rate a company can charge which may result in writing underpriced business. See “Risk Factors - Regulations” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
In an attempt to make capital and surplus requirements more accurately reflect the underwriting risk of different lines of insurance, as well as investment risks that attend insurers’ operations, the NAIC annually tests insurers’ risk-based capital requirements. As of December 31, 2019, each of the Pooled Companies had adequate levels of capital as defined by the NAIC with its respective risk-based capital requirements.
The property and casualty insurance industry is also affected by court decisions. In general, premium rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit. These rates contemplate a certain level of risk. The courts may modify, in a number of ways, the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume, including eliminating exclusions, expanding the terms of the contract, multiplying limits of coverage, creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed. Courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures, which reforms were intended to reduce a litigant’s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism. These court decisions can adversely affect an insurer’s profitability. They also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected, and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can unfavorably impact an insurer.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was extended in 2005, 2007 and again in 2019. The 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act provides an extension through 2027. Under these Terrorism Acts, commercial property and casualty insurers like State Auto Group, in exchange for making terrorism coverage available, may be entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal Government for a portion of their aggregate losses. As required by the Terrorism Acts, we offer policyholders in specific lines of commercial insurance the option to elect Terrorism coverage. In order for a loss to be covered under the Terrorism Act, the loss must meet the aggregate industry loss minimum and must be the result of an act of terrorism as certified by the Secretary of the Treasury. Policyholders may choose to reject terrorism coverage (terrorism coverage is mandatory for workers compensation). If the policyholder rejects coverage for certified acts of terrorism, we will only cover such acts of terrorism that are not certified acts under the Terrorism Acts and continue to apply policy exclusions that may limit any coverage from loss due to nuclear, biological or chemical agents. Our current commercial property reinsurance excludes certified acts of foreign terrorism and loss due to nuclear, biological or chemical agents. Insurers participating in the Terrorism Acts are required to provide information regarding insurance coverage for terrorism losses, including; (i) lines of business with exposure to such losses; (ii) premiums earned on such coverage; (iii) geographical location of exposures; (iv) pricing of such coverage; (v) the take-up rate for such coverage; and (vi) the amount of private reinsurance for acts of terrorism purchased. See Risk Factors- Terrorism" in Item 1A of this From 10-K. 
The Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) was established in 2010 by the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. The FIO is a separate office within the United States Department of Treasury. The primary objective of the FIO is to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry, including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the United States financial system. The FIO also coordinates and develops federal policy on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including representing the United States in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, assists in negotiating certain international agreements, monitors access to affordable insurance by traditionally underserved communities and consumers, minorities, and low- and moderate-income persons, and assists in the administration of the terrorism risk insurance program; however, the FIO has no authority as a regulator or supervisor of insurance companies.
