ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
We a newly incorporated blank check company, incorporated as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic location, we intend to focus our search for a target business that capitalizes on our sponsor’s sector expertise, network and experience.
The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on December 16, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”). On December 21, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 units (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit, each Unit comprised of one share of Class A Common Stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Public Shares”), and one half-of-one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at a purchase price of $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”), generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000. We granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. On January 11, 2022, the over-allotment option was partially exercised and the underwriters purchased 1,500,000 additional Units (the “Additional Units”) at $10.00 per Additional Unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $15,000,000.
On December 21, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 5,800,000 private placement warrants (the “Private Warrants”), at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, of which 5,050,000 Private Warrants were sold to Revelstone Capital, LLC (the “Sponsor”) and 750,000 Private Warrants were sold to Roth Capital Partners, LLC, one of the representatives of the underwriters (“Roth”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,800,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants sold in the IPO, except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement. On January 11, 2022, the Sponsor purchased an additional 450,000 Private Warrants when the underwriter partially exercised their over-allotment option, generating additional proceeds of $450,000.
A total of $166,650,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering, including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Warrants simultaneous with the Initial Public Offering and at the time of the partial exercise of the over-allotment option was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our stockholders.
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within eighteen (18) months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Our Company
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated in April, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target, and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities and activities related to this offering. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues unless and until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, debt or a combination of cash, shares of stock and debt.
Although we may pursue a business combination in any industry, our objective is to identify and consummate a business combination with a business in the consumer, media and/or technology sectors that leverages D2C engagement as its primary go-to-market channel. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased consumers’ focus on health, wellness and fitness, while simultaneously accelerating consumers’ adoption of digital and mobile commerce platforms. In addition, we believe that digital ubiquity, the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing consumer focus on health, wellness and fitness creates a significant opportunity for established D2C and digitally native brands focused on health, wellness and fitness (which we refer to as active consumer brands throughout this prospectus) to expand their customer bases, enhance market share and create sustainable value.
We believe that the deal generation, sector expertise, execution and operational capabilities of our management team, which is led by our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Morgan Callagy and Daniel Neukomm, will make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses, enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination, and bring compelling value to shareholders of the post-business combination company. In particular, each of Mr. Callagy and Mr. Neukomm, who are the co-founders of Revelstone Capital, an affiliate of our sponsor focused on investments across the active consumer brands ecosystem, bring more than 20 years of investment and operational experience, respectively, which we believe will enhance our ability to identify, underwrite and pursue an initial business combination with an attractive target business. We intend to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a partner that has extensive operational, capital markets and investment management experience in our areas of focus, and that presents potential for an attractive return to our investors. We believe that by optimizing its capital structure and allocating capital efficiently, and by operating under a deliberate long-term strategy, we can rapidly scale or bring about a transformation in our target business’ operations. Additionally, our management team has deep insight in building ecosystems and brands, consumer buying patterns and technologies required to put together powerful solutions and business models.

Further, affiliates of La Jolla Group are investors in the sponsor and have indirect interests in a portion of the founder shares, which we believe will further align their incentives with those of our stockholders. We believe that the industry expertise and relationships of our management team and board of directors, together with the resources and expertise of La Jolla Group, will help us identify, evaluate and pursue a substantial number of attractive potential business combination opportunities and allow us to add significant value to the initial business combination target we ultimately select.

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.
For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on December 20, 2021.
