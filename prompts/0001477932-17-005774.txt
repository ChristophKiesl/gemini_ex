ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 5, 1998, under the name “Octillion Corp.” On December 2, 2008, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name to New Energy Technologies, Inc. Effective as of March 9, 2015, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to SolarWindow Technologies, Inc.
 
We are exclusively focused on the commercialization, continued development and refinement of, and the marketing of our SolarWindow™ technology including, but not limited to, the development and design of, and the bringing to market of, products derived from our SolarWindow™ technology.

At the time of this filing, our proprietary patent-pending SolarWindow™ see-through (“transparent”) electricity-generating coatings are the subject of sixty (60) U.S. and international patent filings.
 
Our SolarWindow™ technology provides the ability to harvest light energy from the sun and artificial sources and generate electricity from a transparent, coating of organic photovoltaic (“OPV”) solar cells, applied to glass and plastics, thereby creating a “photovoltaic” effect. Photovoltaics are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons. Typically, conventional PV power is generated by making use of solar modules composed of a number of cells containing PV and electricity-conducting materials. These materials are usually opaque (i.e., not see-through) and only effectively generate electricity with sun light, Our researchers have replaced these materials with compounds that allow our SolarWindow™ technology to remain see-through or “transparent,” while generating electricity when exposed to either sun or artificial light.
 
Initially being developed for application on glass surfaces, SolarWindow™ could potentially be used on any of the more than eighty-five (85) million commercial and residential buildings in the United States alone.
 
We are continuing commercialization, continued development and marketing process directly through joint venture agreements with private entities and, in part, under the auspices of a Stevenson-Wydler Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (the “NREL CRADA”) with the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (the “Alliance for Sustainable Energy”), which is the operator of The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”).
 
On August 2, 2017, we entered into a Process Integration and Production Agreement (the “PIPA Agreement”) with TriView Glass Industries, LLC (“Triview”). Triview is a glass fabricator operating a manufacturing facility in City of Industry, California. The purpose and primary goals of the agreement are to:
 


1. | establish commercial scale manufacturing methodologies and processes to fabricate products based on SolarWindow technologies and 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | integrate SolarWindow™ technologies into the Triview’s manufacturing process, to fabricate specific SolarWindow™ transparent electricity-generating glass products.

 
We have achieved numerous important milestones and overcome major technical challenges in the development of our SolarWindow™ technology, including the ability to generate electricity on glass while remaining transparent. This year, our SolarWindow™ transparent electricity-generating coatings on glass were successfully processed through the rigorous autoclave system for window glass lamination at a commercial window fabricator. Layered with SolarWindow™ electricity-generating liquid coatings, glass modules were subjected to the extremely high heat and pressure of autoclave equipment located at the fabricator’s facility. Despite the SolarWindow™ modules being subjected to the harsh pressure and temperature conditions, subsequent performance testing confirmed that the modules continued to produce power.
 
Additionally, we have scaled-up our technology from a single solar cell – only one-quarter the size of a grain of rice – to a working array of solar cells which form a one-foot by one-foot working prototype – our largest-ever SolarWindow™. 
 
Our technological advancements over the past two years now enable us to fabricate a pane of glass coated with our SolarWindow™ technology by simply applying our transparent, electricity-generating coatings onto glass surfaces at room temperature and pressure; this process represents a significant technical achievement which may provide a manufacturing advantage over expensive and cumbersome high temperature and high positive or negative pressure-sensitive manufacturing methods common to conventional solar photovoltaic (“PV”) manufacturing.
 
To advance the technical development and commercialization of our SolarWindow™ products, we are actively seeking technology and product licensing and joint venture arrangements with additional research institutions, commercial partners, and organizations with established technical competencies, market reach, and mature distribution networks in the solar PV, building-integrated PV, and alternative and renewable energy market industries.

Our Important Milestones
 
We have been working to further designing, testing, our SolarWindow™ technology, as well as developing a prototype of our SolarWindow™, for application to commercial flat glass in tall towers since November 2006. 
 
To date we have achieved a number of important milestones in our SolarWindow™ product development efforts towards our ultimate goal, including, but not limited to:
 


· | processed our SolarWindow™ transparent electricity-generating glass modules through the rigorous autoclave system for window glass lamination at a commercial window fabricator; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | successfully completed important freeze/thaw performance testing necessary for the commercialization of our transparent electricity-generating coatings; modules were subjected to more than 200 freeze/thaw cycles, which yielded favorable performance results of the edge sealing processes and minimal impact on the device electrical performance;
· | expanded product development and successfully applied our electricity-generating coatings onto flexible glass – as thin as a business card (only 0.1-millimeter-thick) – that is flexible enough to be bent without breaking or cracking; 
· | entered into the NREL CRADA which is still in effect; 
· | filed sixty (60) patent applications for our electricity-generating coating and SolarWindow™ technology development efforts; 
· | expanded the use of our SolarWindow™ coatings to include two new product lines for commercial and military aircraft, and the safety and security of military pilots; 
· | generated electricity on flexible plastic using novel see-through SolarWindow™ coatings; 
· | developed new SolarWindow™ coatings with increased transparency and improved color; 
· | produced the largest OPV device ever fabricated at NREL in the institute’s history; 
· | successfully collected and transported electricity using a virtually ‘invisible’ conductive wiring system developed for SolarWindow™; and 
· | completed performance tests of its transparent electricity-generating coatings for glass and flexible plastics for glass-to-glass lamination processes.. 

 
Products Derived from our SolarWindow™ Technology
 
On September 16, 2010, we publicly unveiled a working four-inch by four-inch prototype of our proprietary SolarWindow™ technology. Scientists at the event powered lights on a scale-model house by exposing our transparent SolarWindow™ to artificial light from fluorescent lamps, mimicking lighting typically installed inside offices. 
 
Researchers also repeatedly opened and closed window shades, successfully powering LED lights each time SolarWindow™ was exposed to natural light. This demonstration mimicked outdoor exposure such as sunlight on the exterior façade of commercial buildings – our initial target market and, we believe, a promising early application of the technology.

Scientists at the debut event not only demonstrated the ability to generate “voltage” to power lighting, but also revealed SolarWindow™ capacity to produce “current” necessary for powering mechanical devices and appliances. Researchers successfully powered the mechanical rotor blades of a small helicopter using only a single, small-scale SolarWindow™ prototype exposed to a solar simulator.
 
In February 2012, we successfully developed the largest OPV device fabricated at NREL, measuring 170cm2, approximately 14 times larger than previous devices produced at NREL. In March 2012, we, in collaboration with NREL researchers, successfully collected and transported electricity using a virtually ‘invisible’ conductive wiring system developed for SolarWindow™. The ability to transport electricity on glass windows while remaining transparent is especially important to the eventual deployment of an aesthetically pleasing commercial product.
 
On March 8, 2014, we made public never-before-seen images of our largest area, high-performance SolarWindow™ arrays. These SolarWindow™ arrays measure over 232 cm² – a significant achievement for size, improving upon our previous achievements at NREL, and produced with highly-uniform, colored tints preferred by commercial window manufacturers for installation on skyscrapers, worldwide. Among the most important criteria for developing SolarWindow™ coating applications for today’s skyscrapers is providing a set of neutral colors that remain see-through and are uniform in fabrication. We revealed a record-breaking, largest-area transparent, OPV SolarWindow™ array that addresses tall-tower and commercial building glass requirements, they also bear the promise of facile scale-up capabilities and manufacturability. This SolarWindow™ array is over 35% larger than our previously-fabricated, 170 cm² working module achievement. That prior module was already 14 times larger than the then-previous largest-area OPV module for the same type device structure ever fabricated at the NREL.
 
In September 2014, we demonstrated SolarWindow™ electricity-generating coatings to Congress during the first ever National Lab Day on Capitol Hill. National Lab Day was cosponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. On April 8, 2015, Engineers and research scientists at the University of North Carolina Charlotte Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (“UNCC-EPIC”) have independently reviewed and validated our proprietary Model. The Model calculates a financial payback of less than one year for our transparent electricity-generating SolarWindow™ technology. UNCC-EPIC team of engineering and science experts, who independently validated the modeling assumptions, reference data, and technical basis important to calculating our one-year financial payback period for SolarWindow™ systems. UNCC-EPIC validation also confirmed the proficiency of our methodology for modeling the performance of competing PV technologies.
 
In May, 2015 we announced plans to replace traditional electrical wiring connections with a simplified next-generation system for collecting the power produced by its transparent electricity-generating windows. In addition to reducing costs, ease of electrical installation will be important to window fabricators, glass installers (i.e., glaziers), electricians, and maintenance personnel. The replacement of today’s cumbersome methods with our easy power connection system (‘module interconnects’) is also important for new construction and retrofit applications of SolarWindow™ electricity-generating window modules on skyscrapers and tall towers.
 
On August 20, 2015, we featured a first-ever demonstration of our working, electricity-generating window unit, during our webcast. Webcast participants witnessed clean electricity being generated on a demonstration window unit. Its glass is tinted in a high-demand color and framed in aluminum, popular with architects and developers of commercial towers – our target market. Participants also heard us explain exactly how we plan to: generate revenue, work towards product development and getting SolarWindow ™ ready for commercial manufacturing, build shareholder value, expand our name recognition and branding plans, increase investor outreach, engage media, and outlined important next steps for commercialization and bring SolarWindow™ products to market. 
 
On May 17, 2017, we featured the successful processing of our SolarWindow™ transparent electricity-generating coatings on glass through the rigorous autoclave system for window glass lamination at a commercial window fabricator. Layered with SolarWindow™ electricity-generating liquid coatings, glass modules were subjected to the extremely high heat and pressure of autoclave equipment located at the fabricator’s facility. Despite the SolarWindow™ modules being subjected to the harsh pressure and temperature conditions, subsequent performance testing confirmed that the modules continued to produce power.

We are currently developing seven products (collectively, the “SolarWindow™ Products”) derived from our SolarWindow™ technology:
 


· | SolarWindow™ – Commercial – A flat glass product for installation in new commercial towers under construction and replacement windows; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | SolarWindow™ – Structural Glass – Structural glass walls and curtains for tall structures; 
· | SolarWindow™ – Architectural Glass – Textured and decorative interior glass walls, room dividers, etc.; 
· | SolarWindow™ – Residential – A window glass for installation in new residential homes under construction and replacement windows; 
· | SolarWindow™ – Flex – Flexible films which may be applied directly onto “previously installed (window) glass, similar to aftermarket window tint films, for retrofit to existing commercial towers, buildings, and residential homes; Note these films can also be applied to otherwise conventional windows during construction
· | SolarWindow™ – BIPV – Components associated with BIPV applications in homes, buildings, and office towers; and 
· | SolarWindow™ - Retrofit Veneer - Transparent, tinted, and flexible veneers that installers can apply directly onto “previously installed (window) glass. 

 
Currently, we are concentrating on the development and deployment of SolarWindow™-Commercial, Structural, and Architectural glass products. 
 
Although our efforts have already produced early working prototypes for these applications, commercialization of the SolarWindow™ technology will require significant further product development and testing, and validation. This additional work should enable us to ascertain whether the SolarWindow™ technology can actually form the basis for a commercially viable technology or product.
 
Our commercialization pathway has led us to the PIPA Agreement with Triview, pursuant to which we are seeking to achieve the following goals:
 


1. | the establishment of commercial scale manufacturing methodologies and processes to fabricate products based on SolarWindow technologies and 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | the integration of our SolarWindow™ technologies into the Triview’s manufacturing process, to fabricate specific SolarWindow™ transparent electricity-generating glass products.

 
In addition to SolarWindow™-Commercial, Structural, and Architectural products, we are also developing SolarWindow™ Retrofit Veneer products as transparent, tinted, flexible and rigid veneers that installers can apply directly over top of existing windows. This expanded product line broadens our market reach beyond new and replacement installations, to include windows currently installed on the estimated five million commercial buildings constructed in the U.S. alone. As noted, the SolarWindow™ Retrofit Veneer products will be developed concurrently with the other SolarWindow™ products currently under development.

Our Industry and Market Opportunity
 
Overview
 
Global energy consumption is expected to increase 53% from 2008 to 2035, according to the Energy Information Administration, and domestic electricity prices have been rising as a consequence of the increased cost of conventional electricity generation fuels and the easing of price caps in some states.
 
From a total glass market perspective, the world demand for flat glass was estimated to be approximately 8.3 billion square meters. The global flat glass market was estimated to be worth approximately $8.3 billion in 2016. Importantly, the global market value of fabricated flat glass was estimated to exceed approximately $100 billion for 2016.
 
America is the world’s largest consumer of electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, with nearly 70% of the nation’s electricity generated by coal and natural gas; 50% of the total U.S. electrical generation relies on coal, a fossil fuel. The environmental impact and rising costs of these non-renewable fuels, along with the potential doubling of global electricity consumption in the coming years, illustrate the need for more creative, sustainable methods for generating electrical power. A forecast of US electricity demand shows an expected increase is usage of 40% by 2032.
 
We believe our products uniquely address a growing market opportunity for technologies able to generate sustainable electricity. Rising energy costs, increasing electricity consumption, and the need for a cleaner alternative to today’s non-renewable energy sources, all contribute to the growing demand for clean, renewable alternative energy sources. Renewable energy, especially solar and wind has reached a key tipping point whereby many renewable energy projects may compete directly with fossil fuel power plants without the need for subsidies. Legislation or fiscal support may no longer be needed to expand renewable energy. 
 
The Market Opportunity for our SolarWindow™ Technology and Products
 
Based on initial market research, there are no commercially marketed OPV see-through glass windows similar to our SolarWindow™ device technology capable of generating electricity, available for sale in the United States. We believe our SolarWindow™ technology and products could be uniquely positioned as first-to-market, if commercially launched.
 
Unprecedented levels of government initiatives, heightened residential demand for green construction, and improvements in sustainable materials are driving green building. Because buildings account for almost 50% of the energy consumed in developed countries, governments are putting increased focus on legislation and policies to improve their energy efficiency, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In North America, initiatives such as the environmental building rating system (LEED) run by the U.S. Green Building Council are helping to transform the market for added-value glazing, and this trend is expected to continue. We anticipate similar opportunities in Europe, through the development of a European Union-wide energy labeling system for windows. 
 
Our SolarWindow™ Products are under development for application to glass surfaces in such buildings, often referred to as “architectural flat glass” and “fabricated glass products.” In 2010, an industry report on flat glass by Pilkington, a major global glass manufacturer, noted that the ten largest cities in the United States had more than 444 million square feet of architectural glass. We do not believe that number has diminished over the past seven years; rather, we believe that this market is growing in volume, with global growth reported to be approximately 4-5% annually, with Europe, China and North America accounting for over 70% of global demand, according to the same report. Market research reports estimated the global flat glass market to be worth approximately $8.3 billion in 2016.

Competition for SolarWindow™ Technology and Products
 
The solar PV industry is highly competitive and such competition is increasing as participants in the industry keeps growing. Although we are not aware of other products utilizing technology substantially similar to our SolarWindow™ technology, numerous solar cell technologies have been developed, or are being developed, by a number of companies.
 
Such technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to, the use of organic materials, advanced crystalline silicon thin film concepts, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, copper-indium-gallium-selenide, titanium dioxide, and copper indium di-selenide, and others to generate electricity from the sun’s light. Given the time, investment and advances in manufacturing technologies, any of these competing technologies may achieve lower manufacturing costs, superior performance, or greater market acceptance than our SolarWindow™ technology product, currently under development.
 
We face competition from many companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and products) obsolete.

The descriptions of the products and technologies being developed or marketed by our competitors listed below have been taken from publicly available documents or reports filed by these companies:
 
 
· | Ubiquitous Energy is a company that began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is initially moving toward the electronics (tablet & E-reader, cell phone) market. Their first product seems to be a very clear, high VLT, low efficiency charging system for the electronics market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Solarmer is developing organic photovoltaic or OPV technology, targeting portable power, off-grid power, and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) markets. Solarmer will utilize its materials, devices, and roll-to-roll process technology to manufacture OPV modules with strategic partners throughout the world. Solarmer sells and provides OPV modules to product developers and system integrators who will integrate them into various products;
· | ONYX Solar is a new type of solar company, while they are not an OPV material company, the company is considered a competitor in the space for generating power under low light conditions. Their current technology is mixture of semitransparent amorphous Si, Crystalline Si and possibly Copper, Indium, Gallium, Selenide (CIS or CIGS) and is also working on OPV. They are currently in production, and are generating revenue; 
· | Sharp Corporation has developed mass-production technology for stacked triple-junction thin-film solar cells by turning a conventional two-active-layer structure (amorphous silicon plus microcrystalline silicon) into a triple-junction structure with amorphous silicon (two active layers) and microcrystalline silicon (single active layer); 

 
These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
 


· | significantly greater name recognition; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | established distribution networks; 
· | more advanced technologies and product development; 
· | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; 
· | processes that are operational and manufacturing prototype or final products; 
· | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products, and marketing approved products; and
· | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation. 

 
Our commercial success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensee or sublicenses’, if any, to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to: safety, price, marketing and distribution.
 
If our competitors were to succeed in developing products that are more effective than our SolarWindow™ technology, some or all of our SolarWindow™ Products could be rendered obsolete and non-competitive. Accordingly, in addition to our research and development efforts, we have undertaken a public relations, advertising, and market access outreach programs designed to establish our “brand” name recognition early on in our corporate development; we intend to continue to develop and market our brand name pending commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our research and development efforts. We believe our strategy ultimately will facilitate the marketing, distribution and public acceptance of any products we may derive from our research and development efforts if and when regulatory approval is received.
 

11

 
Competition with respect to our SolarWindow™ technology and ultimately, our SolarWindow™ Products is and will be based, among other things, on safety, reliability, availability, price, marketing, distribution and patent position. Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technology development and commercial sales. Another important factor will be the timing of market introduction of any SolarWindow™ Products we develop. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop our SolarWindow™ Products, complete safety approvals processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of any products we develop to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor.
