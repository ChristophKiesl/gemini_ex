Markets and Market Opportunity
 
There are two key market drivers for our long-term growth: Industrial IoT and 5G. We believe that Industrial IoT has the greatest long-term potential for our antennas and ruggedized radio devices to support smart utilities and automation for manufacturing and commercial applications.  Industrial IoT will continue to be a growing market to address remote control and data analysis.  The critical link for many of these systems is the wireless connection between the device and the core system, which is where PCTEL adds value with our antennas, radio devices and sensors.  Enabling reliable and robust wireless connections is critical for wireless Industrial IoT.
 
5G is still in the early phases of deployment to address capacity in dense user areas.  It has better reliability, security, and lower latency than Wi-Fi. Future releases and the availability of new shared spectrum such as Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) will drive further investment in 5G to support private networks and neutral host services in valuable mid-range spectrum.  Private networks provide a lower cost solution than cellular operators to support enterprises and rural areas.  
 
To capitalize on the market opportunities, we focus on the Industrial IoT, intelligent transportation and enterprise wireless markets:
 
Industrial IoT
 
Industrial IoT is about the efficient use of data to make better operating decisions.  Wireless connectivity is often the most critical link in an Industrial IoT system, and our long-term strategy is to be the RF hardware supplier of choice for these systems.  From a hardware perspective, wireless Industrial IoT solutions require antennas, radio modules, access points or modems, and sensors.  Our strategy is to provide a “toolbox” of hardware solutions to our existing OEMs and distributors for Industrial IoT systems.  We provide all of the field hardware required for wireless Industrial IoT systems - antennas, ruggedized Wi-Fi access points, radio modules, and integrated cellular sensors for Industrial IoT. Our go-to-market strategy for this growing sector is to sell more RF hardware components to our customers that traditionally purchase antennas from PCTEL.  We believe we are uniquely positioned to grow in IoT markets given our current antennas sales and our RF, radio hardware and mechanical expertise.

Manufacturing
 
We have historically done final assembly of most of our antennas in-house at our facilities in Tianjin, China, and Bloomingdale, Illinois.  To optimize the cost structure of our antennas and reduce our fixed costs in China, we are in the process of transitioning most of the manufacturing activities from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere.  We expect to substantially complete the transition by the end of fiscal year 2021.  We do final assembly of all our test & measurement products in-house at our facility in Clarksburg, Maryland.
 
By transitioning some of our manufacturing to multiple contract manufacturers with a variety of expertise, we avoid becoming dependent on any specific contract manufacturer.  If any contract manufacturer is unable to provide timely or satisfactory services for us, our other contract manufacturers will be available, provided, however, that transitioning production to a different contract manufacturer could cause delays, disruption and additional costs that could negatively impact timely delivery of our products and our earnings therefrom.  We have no material guaranteed supply contracts or long-term agreements with any of our suppliers, but we do have open purchase orders with several of our suppliers.  See the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section of Note 6 for information on purchase commitments.
