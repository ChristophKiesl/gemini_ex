Business Overview
 
Our mission is to optimize and grow brands on today’s leading online marketplaces. To deliver this mission, we provide a platform of software and services to empower brands to grow their online distribution channel on digital marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Target, and others. Our proprietary software platform of marketplace solutions has been developed with a tech-first approach over the last decade. Through our platform, more than a decade of marketplace expertise, and our subject matter expertise, Kaspien empowers brands to achieve their online retail goals. Through our diversified and flexible partnership approach, Kaspien supports brands all across their brands life cycle and maturity online.
 
By offering a one-stop-shop for all marketplace services, Kaspien intends to diversify its risk and leverage its assets to capture more market share across the seller services space.
 
The Company has positioned itself to be a brand’s ultimate online growth partner. We are guided by seven core principles:
 

Partner Obsession | Insights Driven
-----------------------+----------------
Simplicity | Innovation 
Results | Ownership 
Diversity and Teamwork |

The Kaspien marketplace growth platform allows for a diversified go-to-market approach, enabling economies of scale for multiple operations. A high-level overview of the Kaspien platform is shown in Figure 1 below:

Figure 1: Kaspien platform of products and services
 
The Kaspien marketplace growth platform is improved with increased utilization. It is built upon a data engine that synthesizes roughly one billion data points daily from over ten million unique products. The below image showcases the Kaspien “flywheel.” As brands and products use more services on our platform, Kaspien accumulates more data and derives greater insights, thereby strengthening the value of our platform. With increased growth, partners layer on additional software tools, creating even stronger integration and ultimately driving a more robust value proposition for brands. For Kaspien, this positive flywheel effect leads to partner growth and improved lifetime value of our brand relationships. We measure our success through gross merchandise value growth across the Kaspien platform.

Partners
 Kaspien views all brand customers of our platform as partners and defines them under this nomenclature. Our partners include brands, suppliers, distributors, liquidators, and affiliates such as venture capital firms and marketing agencies, as well as other industry brand aggregators.  Our market sectors include but are not limited to: Pets/Sporting Goods, Tools/Office/Outdoors, Health & Personal Care and Home/Kitchen/Grocery. In fiscal 2020, these top categories made approximately 68% of our total revenue. We organize our operations by category, developing a deep understanding and subject matter expertise in these areas, powering our platform to drive better results across these category focal points.
 
 The Company uses its proprietary data platform to identify brands that would be good strategic fits for its services. We utilize content marketing to strengthen its visibility within the industry. The Company’s public relations efforts consist of press releases, articles in industry publications, and articles on its website to build its brand. In addition, we regularly run advertisements on popular ad platforms such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to bring leads into its sales funnels. 
In addition, Kaspien recently adopted a brand acquisition strategy whereby we will deploy capital to acquire certain strategic brands, bring them onto our platform, increasing the scale of such brands. 


Partnership Models
 The Kaspien platform can be leveraged and engaged in three primary different business models.
 
Retail-as-a-Service (“RaaS”): We own inventory. We sell it.
 In this model, Kaspien buys inventory and sells it on marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, and eBay as a third-party seller. Additionally, Kaspien supports private label “dropship” integrations with various suppliers and distributors as well as incubates its own brands. At the end of fiscal 2019, Kaspien had a total of six (6) incubated brands – Jumpoff Jo, Brilliant Bee, Big Betty, Domestic Corner, Coy Beauty, Max Threads and Keto. In RaaS, our business model is the same as that of a wholesale retailer. During fiscal 2020, revenue per partner increased 40% to $237,000 from $169,000 in fiscal 2019.


Agency-as-a-Service(“AaaS”): Partner owns inventory. We sell it.
 In this model, Kaspien serves as an extension of a partner’s e-commerce team, providing full service and managed services in the areas of inventory management, marketing management, creative, brand control, tax, compliance and other marketplace growth services. Kaspien charges a subscription fee and receives a small percentage of the revenue generated.
 
Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”): Partner owns inventory and sells it.
 In this model, Kaspien provides partners access to software through its platform of proprietary technology to empower partners to self-manage their marketplace channel. Kaspien charges a subscription fee and receives a percentage of the transaction.
 
 The “Agency as a Service” and “Software as a Service” models are collectively called “Subscriptions.” The software products and tech-enabled services that form subscriptions are as follows:
 

Software: - Ad Management - Brand Protection and Seller Tracking - Cost Recovery and Case Management - Inventory Management and Advanced Supply Chain - Dropship Automation | Services: - Creative Services - Tax Compliance - Inventory Management & Supply Chain - Digital Marketing 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of January 30, 2021, we had 825 partners across our portfolio of external brand partners, including nearly 693 retail partners and 132 subscriptions partners. The Company’s subscriptions partner base increased 207% compared to fiscal year 2019.
 
While used for different models, the platform is designed to benefit from network effects. The more partners on our platform, the more data and insights it can collect. The more insights it gets, more products and services it can serve its partners and more marketplace integrations it can support. The more marketplace providers that can be integrated, the greater the number of possible partners to engage in our services.


Technology and Integrations
 
The Company’s marketplace platform is a one stop shop insights driven platform built upon over a decade of marketplace selling data. The platform includes a variety of artificial intelligent, data science solutions spanning across brand protection services, logistics and supply chain optimization, automated pricing, advertising marketing management, creative and content services, tax and compliance services, among others. This is all accessible through the Kaspien platform and can be leveraged through a managed service or a software as a service model.
 
The platform uses an insight driven approach to digital marketplace retailing using proprietary software. Using data collected from marketplaces, optimal inventory thresholds and purchasing trends are calculated within its advanced inventory management software developed in-house. Kaspien also has proprietary software related to pricing, advertisement management, marketplace seller tracking and channel auditing.
 
Additionally, the Kaspien platform can be extended to our business and service providers that are synergistic to Kaspien. This enables a network of partner integrations that can be extended and expanded upon. The Kaspien platform has formed strategic relationships and partnerships with these other listed marketplace service providers, including Deliverr and MyFBAPrep in the logistics and fulfillment space,  TaxCloud, a tax services provider, VantageBP, a brand protection agency, Levin Consulting, an electronics specialty retailer, and others.

Business Environment
   Digital marketplaces allow consumers to shop from a variety of merchants in one place and have become an integral part of many brand manufacturers’ businesses.
 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, total U.S. e-commerce sales in 2020 were $792 billion, up 32.4% from 2019 as the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdowns pushed shoppers to rely on internet retailers for their consumer needs. Total retail sales in 2020 increased 3.4% from the prior year. As a result, e-commerce sales ended the year accounting for 14% of all U.S. retail sales, up from 11% in 2019.
 
According to emarketer.com, worldwide e-commerce sales in 2020 were $4.3 trillion, up 27.6% from 2019. Total worldwide retail sales declined 3.0% to $23.9 trillion. Worldwide e-commerce growth is projected to increase 14.3% in 2021. Although the growth will slow, e-commerce penetration of total global retail continues to rise and is predicted to be 19.5% of total retail.
 
In the United States, we sell on marketplaces that represent 50% of national e-commerce sales (Amazon.com, Walmart.com, eBay.com, Target.com, Google.com, Sears.com, jet.com, Pricefalls.com, Overstock.com, Wish.com). Internationally, we sell on marketplaces in the U.K. (Amazon.uk), Germany (Amazon.de), Canada (Amazon.ca) and India (Amazon.in). In 2021, Kaspien intends to begin selling its services in Japan and Mexico.
 
Competition and Strategic Positioning
 Kaspien operates in a category within e-commerce called “Marketplace Growth Software and Services”. Businesses in this category provide services to brands and other sellers to facilitate growth on marketplaces. The market is very fragmented, and most providers are focused on a few focus areas where sellers have support needs. Subcategories in this market include: Account and Marketing Services, Supply Chain and Logistics Providers, Manufacturers and Product Suppliers, Legal Services and Accounting, Tax and Financial Services. In the Account and Marketing Services subcategory, services are further divided into retail services, agency services and software services. This is analogous to our business models – Retail as a Service, Agency as a Service and Software as a Service.
 
Kaspien positions itself as a comprehensive and fully customizable platform of software and services tailored towards online marketplace growth. Kaspien core focus is on the Account and Marketing Services subcategory and competes in this subcategory with Software Providers, Agencies and Retailers.
 
 Our focus on the platform and subscriptions services has fueled strong growth in our subscription services, growing our partner base by 214% from 42 to 132 partners within our subscription platform. Our annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) in our subscriptions business grew by 181% from $0.7 million to $1.8 million from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. 
Revenue Distribution
 Kaspien’s primary source of revenue is through its “Retail as a Service” business, specifically as a third-party seller on the Amazon US marketplace. In fiscal 2020, the share of our retail revenues generated from our Amazon US business was 86%, as compared to 91% in fiscal 2019. Our international retail business grew from 3.2% in fiscal year 2019 to 4.8% in fiscal year 2020. The remaining retail revenue is generated from other marketplaces including Amazon International, Walmart, eBay and Target+.
 
Kaspien focuses on a broad array of categories, including pet supplies, sporting goods, tools/office/outdoors, health & personal care and home/kitchen/grocery. In fiscal year 2020, these categories represented  approximately 68% of our total revenue. Kaspien organizes our operations by category, developing a deep understanding and subject matter expertise in these areas, enabling us to drive better results across these categories.

Human Capital

As of January 30, 2021, the Company employed approximately 136 people, of whom approximately 130 were employed on a full-time basis. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had department heads in the areas of marketing, supply chain, private label, business development, account management, human resources, accounting, FP&A, warehouse operations, compliance, product management, data, and engineering. Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully
 
The Company believes that its success depends on the ability to attract, develop, retain and incentivize our existing and new employees, consultants, and key personnel. It also believes that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of its key personnel significantly benefits its operations and performance. The principal purposes of equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of the Company’s core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect the Company’s workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. These actions include shutting down its headquarters for some months during 2020, wearing facemasks in common areas in the office, and allowing employees to work from home.
 
Customer Acquisition
 Kaspien engages its partners through a combination of brand building, inbound digital marketing, and outbound sales, as well as using its proprietary data platform to identify brands that would be a strategic fit for its services. Kaspien utilizes content marketing to strengthen its visibility within the industry.
