Item 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of cancer with an expertise in infectious diseases that drives specific opportunities. Our portfolio includes small-molecule and biologic immuno-oncology product candidates intended to treat a wide range of oncology indications. We have two small-molecule product candidates currently in clinical development that target a key immune checkpoint pathway, GDC-0919, in collaboration with Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech and indoximod. These product candidates are IDO pathway inhibitors and focus on breaking the immune system’s tolerance to cancer. Additionally, our biologic product candidates are based on our proprietary HyperAcute® Cellular Immunotherapy technology, which is designed to educate the human immune system to attack cancer cells. We have two HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates in clinical development, tergenpumatucel-L for patients with advanced lung cancer and dorgenmeltucel-L for patients with melanoma. In addition to our core immuno-oncology programs, we are using our expertise in infectious diseases to develop vaccines against Ebola in collaboration with Merck, and the Zika virus. 
We had a net loss of $85.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect to continue to have losses over the next several years as we advance our product candidates through late-stage clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates, and expand our commercialization activities in anticipation of one or more of our product candidates receiving marketing approval.
Founded in 1999 and headquartered in Ames, Iowa, and Austin, Texas, we have a clinical, research and development staff dedicated to our pipeline of product candidates for patients with cancer and other diseases. Additionally, we have offices in Devens, Massachusetts, where we manage the development of and strategic relationships relating to our infectious disease program.
Our strategy
Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of cancer where the needs of patients are unmet by current therapies. The critical components of our business strategy include:

• | Supporting the development of GDC-0919 through the strategic collaboration with Genentech.


• | Obtaining additional clinical data for indoximod in melanoma, brain, pancreatic, lung and prostate cancers.


• | Developing improved formulations of indoximod that will enhance clinical and commercial potential.


• | Seeking further regulatory approvals and exclusivity for the indoximod program.


• | Strengthening our pipeline of oncology product candidates though our active drug discovery and business development programs.


• | Completing the trials for and evaluating the data from the two HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates.


• | Supporting Merck in the further development of our Ebola vaccine product candidate, and developing the Zika program to the point at which it is appropriate for a strategic collaboration.

Checkpoint inhibitors - The IDO/TDO “pathway”
We have a clinical development program focused on the IDO (indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase) and TDO (tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase) pathways. Our small-molecule IDO pathway inhibitor product candidates currently in clinical development include GDC-0919 (in collaboration with Genentech) and indoximod (not in collaboration). Both product candidates are designed to counteract immunosuppressive effects of the IDO pathway, a fundamental mechanism regulating immune response. These two distinct small molecules target the IDO pathway by different mechanisms of action and therefore represent two different types of product candidates. IDO pathway inhibitors are another set of immune checkpoint inhibitors akin to the recently developed antibodies targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 and represent potential breakthrough approaches to cancer therapy. 
We believe that immune system failure is a fundamental reason for the inability of the human body to successfully fight cancer cells. Research into the inability of the immune system to respond to cancerous tumors indicates that tumors can induce 
4

the human immune system to tolerate the existence of the tumor. This immune tolerance and suppression represents a major barrier to successful treatment of cancer and is a significant target for new therapeutics.
Scientific understanding of the process leading to immune tolerance, while moving rapidly, is still in its early stages. We believe IDO is part of a system that may be used by some tumors as a mechanism to evade the immune system.
In cancer, the IDO pathway regulates immune response by suppressing T-cell activation, which enables local tumors to avoid immune response. The IDO pathway is expressed in many cancers, both within tumor cells as a direct defense against T-cell attack, and also within antigen presenting cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, whereby this pathway promotes peripheral tolerance to tumor associated antigens (TAAs). When hijacked by developing cancers in this manner, the IDO pathway may facilitate the survival, growth, invasion and metastasis of malignant cells whose expression of TAAs might otherwise be recognized and attacked by the immune system. 
The IDO pathway refers to a series of reactions initiated by IDO that result in the reduction of the amino acid tryptophan in the local tumor environment. We believe the local presence of tryptophan in adequate concentrations promotes antitumor T-cells, and the local reduction of tryptophan combined with the presence of the break-down product of tryptophan metabolism, kynurenine, is understood to suppress the activation of T-cells. We believe that GDC-0919 inhibits the IDO enzyme directly and thereby prevents the metabolism of tryptophan. Our current understanding is that indoximod acts in part directly on T-cells that have been suppressed by IDO mediated mechanisms. Indoximod is generally understood to alter this suppression, returning the immune system to a more active state. 
5

Indoximod may also “mimic” tryptophan and thereby signal the activation of antitumor T-cells in a local microenvironment where IDO is active. We are continuing to investigate the mechanism of action of indoximod.
While traditional chemotherapy places substantial stress on tumor-induced immune tolerance, this effect often dissipates following the end of chemotherapy treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to mitigate immune tolerance in several ways: (1) dying tumor cells release waves of TAAs for processing and presentation, (2) many chemotherapeutic regimens induce a period of transient lymphopenia and homeostatic recovery during which T-cells may become more susceptible to breaking tolerance, and (3) certain regimens can transiently deplete or inactivate tumor-protective T-regulatory cells. However, most chemotherapeutic agents do not appear to trigger a protective immune response against established tumors, as many tumors rapidly re-establish tolerance following each cycle of chemotherapy. We believe a potential portion of this mechanism underlying these phenomenon is IDO expression by APCs in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which triggers an immunosuppression and immune tolerance to cancer. Preclinical and, increasingly, early clinical data have suggested that IDO pathway inhibitors have anti-tumor effects in combination with a number of radiotherapy, chemotherapeutic drugs or other immunotherapy drugs and may work better together than IDO pathway inhibitor treatment alone.
The ability to acutely eliminate the protective IDO mechanism by administering IDO pathway inhibitor drugs, such as GDC-0919 or indoximod, may provide a therapeutic window in which to break tolerance in some tumors and reverse the inhibition of immune cells. 
We believe IDO pathway inhibitor technology has the following potential advantages in combating cancers:

• | Potential to break immune tolerance. The immune tolerance to cancerous cells represents a key barrier to the treatment of cancer. To date, there are several available therapies that have addressed the immune escape mechanisms of cancer. We believe inhibition of the IDO pathway, in combination with other therapies, has the potential to break a key immune escape mechanism of cancer cells and significantly enhance patient outcomes.


• | Tolerability. In early-stage clinical development, we have observed an encouraging safety profile thus far. We believe inhibition of the IDO pathway will selectively enhance the immune response against cancer cells. 


• | Oral bioavailability. Unlike many cancer therapies that require intravenous administration, our IDO pathway inhibitors are orally bioavailable, a potential advantage in ease of administration for patients and physicians. 


• | Synergy with existing cancer therapies. Inhibiting the IDO pathway, in conjunction with other immuno-oncology agents or chemotherapy or radiotherapy, has the potential to enhance the therapeutic effect of these agents. Used in such combination, IDO pathway inhibitors have the potential to delay or disrupt the reacquisition of immune tolerance to tumor antigens during the period following chemotherapy. In addition, our preclinical studies and early clinical studies have suggested the synergistic potential of IDO pathway inhibitors in combination with other immuno-oncology agents, including other checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL-1 antibodies. The safety profile in humans is thus 

6

far conducive to exploring combination therapy and the available data do not suggest severe or synergistic toxicities with many common oncology therapies used in combination thus far.
GDC-0919
GDC-0919 is currently in Phase 1 clinical development led by our collaborators at Genentech. GDC-0919 is being evaluated in a Phase 1b combination clinical trial of GDC-0919 and atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Enrollment began in July 2015 and a total enrollment of up to 305 patients is currently planned. In addition, the Genentech Agreement restricts our ability to communicate about GDC-0919 and other aspects of the collaboration without Genentech’s consent. In general, we expect to release more information about the GDC-0919 program concurrently with Genentech, or in connection with earning a material milestone payment from Genentech. In addition, we conducted a two-year pre-clinical research program with Genentech to discover novel IDO/TDO inhibitors that ended in November 2016.
Indoximod
Indoximod, our proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor, is in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. These trials combine indoximod with both standard of care cancer immunotherapy treatments as well as standard of care chemotherapy for patients with cancer. Indoximod is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for patients with melanoma, pancreatic cancer, malignant brain tumors, metastatic breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. We are concurrently attempting to optimize indoximod’s pharmaceutical properties by developing new formulations, and a prodrug (NLG802), with the objective of improving its clinical and commercial potential. We believe that new indoximod forms may also have the potential for strengthening the intellectual property governing indoximod, particularly outside the United States. Finally, for some such new indoximod formulations and prodrugs, we may be required to prove clinical safety and equivalence to the original formulation, which might have the effect of increasing the time and expense required to initiate a large-scale randomized clinical trial.
Indoximod has successfully completed initial Phase 1 clinical development. Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating indoximod were done in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis and enrolled a total of 65 patients. Indoximod appeared to be tolerated and a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was determined. No dose limiting toxicities were observed. Under the same collaboration, a Phase 1b clinical trial of indoximod in combination with docetaxel for patients with advanced solid tumors was performed. The combination was well tolerated, a dose of the combination was determined for the Phase 2 clinical trial, and clinical responses were observed.
Currently, indoximod is under clinical development in a variety of combinations across several cancer indications, including:

• | NLG2101 Phase 2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with taxane chemotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer was fully enrolled as of the end of 2015. We remain blinded to the results and expect to report such results by the end of 2017.


• | NLG2102 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with temozolomide for patients with refractory malignant brain tumors.


• | Phase 1b clinical results were reported in 2015 and confirmed the combination has an acceptable safety profile and demonstrated some potential, low level preliminary clinical activity of the combination therapy.


• | Phase 2 clinical trial is currently enrolling patients. We expect to report additional progress in 2017.


• | NLG2103 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with ipilimumab or anti-PD-1 antibody for patients with advanced melanoma.


• | Phase 1b clinical trial results were reported in 2015 and confirmed the combination has an acceptable safety profile.


• | The Phase 2 clinical trial is currently enrolling patients. We expect to report an interim analysis in the first half of 2017.


• | NLG2104 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.


• | Phase 1b clinical trial results were reported in 2016 and indicate the combination has an acceptable safety profile and demonstrated preliminary clinical activity.


• | The Phase 2 clinical trial portion has completed enrollment. We expect to report additional progress in 2017.


• | Currently, an additional cohort of patients is being enrolled in a paired biopsy cohort. These patients will supply biopsies of their tumors both before treatment and after two months of treatment with the study regimen.

• | NLG2105 Phase 1 clinical trial of indoximod in combination with temozolomide for pediatric patients with refractory malignant brain tumors is currently enrolling patients.


• | NLG2106 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of indoximod plus standard of care induction chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is currently enrolling in Phase 1b. We expect to provide an update on progress in the second half of 2017.

In addition, we anticipate that an investigator-initiated randomized, blinded, placebo controlled study of indoximod plus the vaccine Provenge® compared to Provenge alone in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer will report findings in the first half of 2017.
The chart below summarizes our current IDO pathway inhibitor product candidates and their stages of development. 
As part of the process to prepare indoximod for clinical trials that could lead to registration, we have been working to optimize the formulation and manufacturing process for indoximod. During this process, we identified several manufacturing changes that might enhance the clinical and commercial potential of indoximod. Specifically, we have identified optimizations that we believe could enhance both the solubility and therefore patient exposure of indoximod as well as intellectual property protections. We expect to bring our product candidates made with these optimizations into clinical trials in 2017. 
Additionally, we have developed a prodrug of indoximod, NLG802. This prodrug is intended to increase bioavailability and exposure to indoximod above the levels currently achievable by direct oral administration of indoximod, as well as provide increased intellectual property protection. We filled a new IND with the FDA in 2017 for this investigational drug and plan to bring it into clinical trials in 2017. The initial trial will be a standard Phase 1 study to assess preliminary safety and to determine the RP2D for subsequent evaluations. NLG802 is a new chemical entity with potential for worldwide expansion of our intellectual property position around this type of IDO pathway inhibitor.
PTEN    
We also have an active drug discovery program focused on Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog in Chromosome 10, or PTEN. Recent advances in the characterization of the IDO pathway have suggested that IDO activates a subset of PD-1-dependent regulatory T-cells, or Tregs, that are potently immunosuppressive. Evidence suggests that these Treg cells mediate systemic immunosuppression against tumor-associated antigens and that the function of PTEN may be important to maintaining the suppressive character of these cells. Based on data obtained in preclinical animal models, it is hoped that the efficacy of PTEN 
8

inhibitors could be enhanced when combined with different standard-of-care therapeutic approaches such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as with IDO pathway inhibitors such as indoximod.
Biologics - HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy
Our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform consists of novel biologic product candidates designed to educate the patient’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates are composed of human cancer cell lines that are tumor specific, but not patient specific. These cells have been modified to express alpha-Gal, a carbohydrate for which humans have preexisting immunity. These alpha-Gal-modified cancer cells are designed to stimulate an immune response against cancer cells. The objective of HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy is to elicit an antitumor response by “educating” the immune system to attack a patient’s own cancer cells. HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies do not require any tissue from individual patients and use intact whole cells rather than cell fragments or purified proteins.
In May 2016, we announced that our Phase 3 clinical trial IMmunotherapy for Pancreatic REsectable cancer Survival Study, or IMPRESS, for algenpantucel-L, which utilizes our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology, failed to achieve its primary endpoint. In light of these results, we conducted an early analysis of our second Phase 3 clinical trial, Pancreatic Immunotherapy with algenpantucel-L for Locally Advanced non-Resectable disease, or PILLAR. There was no difference in survival between the treatment group and the control group. The PILLAR study has been closed. 
We have two HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates currently under clinical development.

• | Tergenpumatucel-L is being investigated in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of tergenpumantucel-L with indoximod and docetaxel for patients with advanced NSCLC.


• | Dorgenmeltucel-L is being investigated in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial for patients with advanced melanoma.

We expect these clinical trials will be completed during 2018.
Vaccines for tropical diseases
Our primary infectious disease program is a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, or rVSV, an advanced vaccine technology developed for the Ebola and Marburg viruses. The rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP vaccine product candidate was originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and is designed to utilize the rVSV vector to induce immunity against Ebola and Marburg viruses when replacing the VSV glycoprotein with corresponding glycoproteins from filoviruses. In November 2014, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement, or the Merck Agreement, with Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp., or Merck, to develop and potentially commercialize our rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP vaccine product candidate and certain other aspects of our vaccine technology. Under the Merck Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million in October 2014, and in February 2015 we received a milestone payment of $20.0 million. We have the potential to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries, if the vaccine is approved and if Merck successfully commercializes it. In addition to milestone payments from Merck, the Company was awarded contracts for development of the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP from the BioMedical Advanced Research & Development Agency (BARDA) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) totaling $52.1 million during 2016 and $67.0 million during 2014 and 2015, for total awards of $119.1 million. 
In July 2015, we announced that the international partnership studying the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP vaccine candidate in Guinea released interim data suggesting that it is effective in the prevention of Ebola disease in a large Phase 3 clinical trial.  According to the announcement, the interim results suggest that the vaccine candidate demonstrates efficacy within about 10 days of administration to a person without the infection. In February, 2017 the final report from the trial was published in The Lancet, which confirmed the interim assessment that rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP offers substantial protection against Ebola virus disease, with no cases among vaccinated individuals from day 10 after vaccination in both randomized and non-randomized clusters.
In February 2016, we announced our initiative to develop a vaccine against the Zika virus. We believe that the experience gained in the development of our Ebola vaccine candidate will give us an advantage in this program. The focus of the program is to develop a product that we may be able to strategically partner.
Cancer Market Overview
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States; the American Cancer Society estimated that more than 600,000 deaths will occur in 2017 and almost 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017. Despite a number 
9

of advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer over the past decade, overall five-year survival rates from all cancer types is 69% for the period spanning 2006-2012 according to the American Cancer Society.
Cancer is characterized by abnormal cells that grow and proliferate, forming masses called tumors. Under certain circumstances, these proliferating cells can metastasize, or spread, throughout the body and produce deposits of tumor cells called metastases. As the tumors grow, they may cause tissue and organ failure and, ultimately, death. To be effective, cancer therapies must eliminate or control the growth of the cancer.
The specialized cells of the immune system recognize specific chemical structures called antigens. Generally, foreign antigens trigger an immune response that results in the removal of disease-causing agents from the body. Cancer cells, however, frequently display antigens that are also found on normal cells. The immune system may not be able to distinguish between tumors and normal cells and therefore may be unable to mount a strong anti-cancer response. Additionally, tumors often express abnormal proteins that could be recognized by the immune system. However, tumors also have various immune-suppressive defense mechanisms that may prevent the immune system from fully activating and recognizing these abnormal antigens.
Current therapies, such as surgery, radiation, hormone treatments and chemotherapy, do not directly address this immune-evasive characteristic of cancer and may not have the desired therapeutic effect. Active immunotherapies stimulate the immune system, the body's natural mechanism for fighting disease, and may overcome some of the limitations of current standard-of-care cancer therapies.
Limitations of Current Cancer Therapies
We believe current cancer treatment alternatives suffer from a number of limitations that impair their effectiveness including:

• | Toxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents are highly toxic to the human body and often cause a variety of side effects, which may include nausea and vomiting, bleeding, anemia and mucositis. Targeted therapeutics may have fewer systemic toxicities, but still tend to have off-target effects such as gastrointestinal inflammation, severe skin reactions and breathing difficulties. These effects limit a patient's ability to tolerate treatment thereby depriving the patient of the potential benefit of additional treatments or treatment combinations that might otherwise destroy or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Once educated as to the limited efficacy, limited increased survival and potentially significant toxicity of existing treatment alternatives, patients diagnosed with terminal cancer often choose to limit or forego therapy in order to avoid further compromising their quality of life. Patients with advanced stage cancer often cannot tolerate cancer therapy, and certain therapies have been shown to hasten death in some cases as the patient's health deteriorates. 


• | Development of resistance. While many current therapeutic approaches may be effective against a particular target, the overall impact of these therapies on treating cancer is limited because the abundance and diversity of tumor cells are believed to enable cancers to adapt and become resistant to these treatments over time resulting in reduced longer-term efficacy. 


• | Short-term approach. Incremental survival benefit is the primary objective of many currently marketed and development-stage cancer therapeutics. In general, many drugs show modest impact on overall survival or only affect progression-free survival. Other than surgical tumor removal, curative intent is often not a focus or realistic potential outcome of many current cancer therapies. 


• | Immune system suppression. Cancer is difficult to treat in part because cancer cells use sophisticated strategies to evade the immune system. Current approaches to cancer treatment generally involve introduction of an agent, such as a chemical, an antibody or radiation. These agents cause cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) or inhibit the proliferation of all cells, including immune cells, thereby indirectly suppressing the immune system. A weakened immune system not only further inhibits the body's natural ability to fight cancer, but also causes patients to become more susceptible to infections and other diseases. 

Grants and Contracts with the United States Government
Other than the upfront payments received in 2014 from Genentech and Merck, grants and contracts with the United States Government accounted for substantially all of our revenue in each of the last three fiscal years. In December 2014, we announced that BARDA had awarded us a contract, as the prime contractor, in the amount of $30.0 million to support the manufacturing and development activities of our Ebola vaccine product candidate, including clinical development through a new 330-person Phase 1b clinical trial. In 2015, BARDA awarded us another $4.5 million under the base contract and exercised an $18.0 million option 
10

on our existing contract to support the scale-up of the manufacturing process related to our Ebola vaccine product candidate. In 2016, BARDA awarded us additional awards under the base contract of $24.5 million, for a total amount of $76.8 million received in awards. In October 2016, we announced that BARDA had issued us a new $24.8 million contract to support the advanced development of the investigational rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP vaccine candidate, designated V920, designed to induce immunity against the Ebola Zaire virus. The new award includes an additional $51.0 million of contract options which may be exercised by BARDA.  The new funding is in support of manufacturing facility readiness, manufacturing process qualification activities, and additional clinical trials to support regulatory approval of the V920 vaccine.
We have also received funding from the United States Department of Defense to support the development of contract manufacturing for the vaccine product candidate for clinical trials. We were awarded funds of $6.4 million from DTRA under the initial base contract and additions to this contract during 2014. In September 2015, DTRA awarded us another $8.1 million base contract with future options totaling $5.2 million to support various development activities of our Ebola vaccine product candidate. In March 2016, DTRA awarded us another $2.9 million base contract with future options totaling $6.3 million. 
Manufacturing
We currently contract with manufacturing organizations to develop and manufacture the novel formulations for our indoximod and prodrug product candidates. We believe that many suppliers would be available for the production of this product candidate, if required. We currently have no plans to build our own manufacturing facility to support this product candidate.
Genentech will be responsible for the manufacturing of GDC-0919 and any other product candidate developed in accordance with the Genentech Agreement.
We manufacture our HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapies at our facilities in Ames, Iowa. We believe this facility is adequate to supply all of the clinical trial drug requirements for the two remaining HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates.
We have entered into an agreement with an established contract manufacturing organization to produce our Ebola vaccine product candidate. After a transition period and subject to conditions, Merck will assume responsibility for manufacturing the Ebola vaccine product candidate in accordance with the Merck Agreement.
Sales and Marketing
We currently own exclusive worldwide commercial rights to our indoximod and HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates. We plan to build a commercial infrastructure to support any of these products, should they receive FDA authorization for marketing and sales in the United States. In addition, we may pursue collaborations or co-promotion arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to complement these efforts or for particular indications or in specific territories. We intend that our commercial infrastructure will be a fully integrated and highly experienced team, consisting of sales, marketing, medical affairs, market access and other positions necessary for a successful product launch in the U.S. market. Outside the United States we will either commercialize and distribute approved products independently or establish collaborations to address specific needs as we have with Genentech and Merck for our other product candidates. 
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Given the significant unmet patient need for new therapies, oncology is an area of focus for many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the discovery and research and development of products for cancer. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new oncology products. In addition, there are a number of multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same cancer indications as our product candidates.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic collaborators, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drugs, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
11

We also face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private research organizations in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants and developing and acquiring technologies, obtaining patent protection, and securing sufficient capital resources for the often lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sales. Moreover, technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors, thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We will also compete for the services of third parties that may have already developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies to target the diseases on which we have focused both inside and outside of the United States. 
Immunotherapy Products for Cancer
The cancer immunotherapy landscape is broad but still in the early stages of development as compared to more established approaches like cytotoxic chemotherapy. Several immunotherapy approaches to cancer have been approved in recent years. As a class of therapeutics, only one FDA-approved active cellular immunotherapy product has been approved to date. Multiple drugs classified as checkpoint inhibitors have been approved since 2011 targeting either CTLA-4 or PD-1 via antibody blockade. Additionally, one oncolytic virus therapy has been approved. The indications for which these agents have been approved include some indications that we are pursuing such as melanoma and NSCLC. Other indications, such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and malignant brain tumors, do not currently have any FDA approved immunotherapy approaches. 
We face intense competition in our development activities. We face competition from many companies in the United States and abroad, including a number of large pharmaceutical companies, firms specialized in the development and production of vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, and other immunotherapies, and major universities and research institutions. Our competitors in the field of immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines include AdaptImmune LLC, Aduro Biotech, Advaxis, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol Myers-Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp., Incyte Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd, and Sanofi SA, among many others. Many other companies are developing or commercializing products in areas that we have targeted for product development. Some of these products use therapeutic approaches that may compete directly with our product candidates. Most of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting preclinical and nonclinical testing and human clinical trials of product candidates, scaling up manufacturing operations and obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and manufacturing facilities. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for drugs more rapidly than we do. If we obtain regulatory approval and launch commercial sales of our product candidates, we also will compete with respect to manufacturing efficiency and sales and marketing capabilities, areas in which we currently have limited experience. 
Strategic Collaborations
Genentech Agreement
In October 2014, we entered into the Genentech Agreement for the development and commercialization of GDC-0919, our clinical stage IDO pathway inhibitor, and a research collaboration for the discovery of next generation IDO/TDO inhibitors to be developed and commercialized under the Genentech Agreement. Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we received an upfront non-refundable payment of $150.0 million. We may be eligible to receive in excess of $1.0 billion in milestone payments based on achievement of certain predetermined development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as escalating royalties on potential commercial sales of multiple products by Genentech. The rates of such royalties will vary based on the stage of the compound at the signing of the Collaboration Agreement, regulatory exclusivity, intellectual property status, and other considerations.
Genentech will be responsible for and will fund development, manufacturing and commercialization of GDC-0919 and next generation IDO/TDO compounds. Genentech also provided us with funding to support our participation in the research collaboration, which ended in November 2016. We have the right to continue to pursue development activities associated with the combination of GDC-0919 with our novel HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform. Additionally, we have retained the option under the Genentech Agreement to co-promote GDC-0919 and next generation IDO/TDO products with Genentech in the United States, subject to certain conditions, if and when such products are approved for sale.
Under the Genentech Agreement, we granted to Genentech an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain of our patents and know-how relating to IDO/TDO, and we have agreed to work exclusively with Genentech with respect to IDO/TDO compounds for a specified number of years. 
12

In addition, the Genentech Agreement restricts our ability to communicate about GDC-0919 and other aspects of the collaboration without Genentech’s consent. In general, we expect to release more information about the GDC-0919 program concurrently with Genentech, or in connection with earning a material milestone payment from Genentech.
Unless earlier terminated, the Genentech Agreement will continue in effect for as long as Genentech has payment obligations to us. Each party may terminate the Genentech Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach of the Genentech Agreement or the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. After the end of the research collaboration in November 2016, Genentech may terminate the Genentech Agreement for convenience upon 180 days written notice.
We have retained all rights to indoximod, our proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor and reformulations or prodrugs related to indoximod, including the ability to develop, commercialize, license and divest indoximod in our discretion.
Merck Agreement
In November 2014, we entered into the Merck Agreement to research, develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate and certain other aspects of our vaccine technology. The Ebola vaccine product candidate was originally developed by PHAC. Under the Merck Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $30.0 million in 2014 and a milestone payment of $20.0 million in 2015, and we have the potential to earn royalties on sales of the vaccine in certain countries, if the vaccine is approved and if Merck successfully commercializes it. In July 2015, we announced that the international partnership studying the rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP (Ebola) vaccine candidate in Guinea released interim data suggesting that it is effective in the prevention of Ebola in a large Phase 3 clinical trial.  According to the announcement, the interim results suggest that the vaccine candidate demonstrates efficacy within about 10 days of administration to a person without the infection. The rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP product candidate will continue to be studied in clinical trials. In February, 2017 the final report from the trial was published in The Lancet, which confirmed the interim assessment that rVSV∆G-ZEBOV GP offers substantial protection against Ebola virus disease, with no cases among vaccinated individuals from day 10 after vaccination in both randomized and non-randomized clusters.
Under the terms of the Merck Agreement, Merck is granted the exclusive rights to the Ebola vaccine product candidate, as well as any follow-on products. The Ebola vaccine product candidate is under an exclusive licensing arrangement with BioProtection Systems, our wholly owned subsidiary and a licensee of PHAC. Under these license arrangements, PHAC retains non-commercial rights pertaining to the vaccine candidate. 
Unless earlier terminated, the Merck Agreement will continue in effect for as long as Merck has royalty payment obligations to us. Merck may terminate the Merck Agreement for convenience upon a specified period of notice or for certain safety reasons with immediate effect. In the event of Merck’s uncured material breach of its obligations under the Merck Agreement with respect to a particular product, we may terminate the Merck Agreement with respect to that product. We may also terminate the Merck Agreement with respect to certain products in the event Merck pursues an alternate product under certain circumstances. Each party may terminate the Merck Agreement for the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
Intellectual Property
We believe that patent protection and trade secret protection are important to our business and that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain our technology licenses, maintain trade secret protection, obtain and maintain patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and abroad. We believe that obtaining identical patents and protection periods for a given technology throughout all markets of the world will be difficult because of differences in patent laws. In addition, the protection provided by non-U.S. patents, if any, may be weaker than that provided by U.S. patents. We have established and continue to build proprietary positions for our IDO pathway inhibitor technology and our HyperAcute technology in the United States and abroad. As of December 31, 2016, our patent portfolio included twenty patent families relating to our IDO pathway inhibitor technology and seven patent families relating to our HyperAcute technology. 
Our IDO pathway inhibitor technology patent portfolio contains several key U.S. patent families that protect indoximod and GDC-0919. A series of patents covering indoximod were exclusively licensed from Augusta University Research Institute, formerly known as Georgia Regents Research Institute, Georgia Health Sciences University Research Institute, Inc. and the Medical College of Georgia Research Institute. The first patent family contains five issued U.S. patents expiring in 2018, 2019 and 2021. This family contains patents having claims to pharmaceutical compositions of 1-methyl-tryptophan (US 8,198,265), methods of increasing T-cell activation (US 6,451,840) and methods of augmenting rejection of tumor cells (US 6,482,416) by administering an IDO inhibitor. The second patent family contains four issued U.S. patents directed to pharmaceutical compositions of indoximod (US 8,232,313, expires in 2024) and to methods of using indoximod to treat cancer (US 7,598,287, US 8,580,844 and 9,463,239 
13

expires in 2027, 2025, and 2024, respectively). In addition, we have pending patents covering indoximod prodrugs and novel formulations of indoximod (PCT/US2016/035391 and US 15/171,031). We do not currently have any non-U.S. patents covering indoximod prodrugs and novel formulations of indoximod, and we cannot assure that we will be able to secure any such patents. 
We believe that significant barriers to entry in the IDO space are provided by three key patent families covering compositions of matter and methods of use of different classes of IDO inhibitor compounds, and are fully owned by us: 1) PCT/US2008/085167 with granted applications in Europe (EP2227233), China, Japan, Canada, and Hong Kong; 2) PCT/US2010/054289, with granted patents in the US (8,722,720), Europe (EP10779364.8) and Canada (CA2778115); and 3) PCT/US2012/033245, which covers the IDO inhibitor compound GDC-0919, currently in clinical development. The national counterparts of the third family provide protection at least until 2032, not counting any patent term adjustment in the United States. This patent has been granted in the United States, Europe, Australia, Israel, Japan, Mexico and New Zealand with multiple applications pending in other countries. Additional barriers to entry are provided through exclusive licenses with Lankenau Institute for Medical Research, or LIMR, and various NewLink-owned inventions, in which we are pursuing patent protection for specific combination therapies targeting the IDO pathway, as well as protection for novel families of inhibitor compounds and second generation products. Four patent families that cover different classes of IDO inhibitor compounds and methods of treatment of cancer have been licensed from LIMR and are represented by several international pending cases and the issued patents US 7,714,139, US 8,476,454, CA 2520586, US 7,705,022, US 8,008,281, JP 4921965, CN ZL200480014321.1, CA 2520172, US 8,383,613, US 8,389,568. An additional patent family co-owned by us and LIMR covers compositions and methods of use of another family of IDO inhibitor compounds (PCT/US2009/041609, with issued patents US 8,748,469, US9174942, Canada 2722159, China 102083429 and pending applications in Europe and Japan).
There is one principal family of patents and patent applications relating to our HyperAcute product candidates and HyperAcute technology. That patent family is exclusively licensed from Central Iowa Health System and includes two pending patent applications and 25 registered U.S. and foreign patents related to the HyperAcute technology. This patent family is expected to provide basic composition of matter patent protection and methods of manufacturing and use of such compositions extending until 2024 and has already resulted in granted patents in U.S. (US 7,763,461, US 8,551,474, US 8,535,658, US 9,474,801, US 9,474,771), Europe (EP 1549353 B1), Mexico (278681), Japan (4966496) and Canada (2501744), all covering pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting pre-established tumor growth comprising attenuated allogeneic tumor cells modified with alpha-Gal. Similar composition claims as well as methods of use for treating pre-established tumors are currently being further pursued in the U.S. and China.
We exclusively license from Central Iowa Health System or own several other patents relating to alpha-Gal technology, which we believe provide additional barriers to entry in the space occupied by our HyperAcute technology. Additional coverage include five applications issued in the United States (US Patents No. 7,998,486, 8,357,777, 8,916,169, 9,090,643 and 9,512,158) and Europe (EP 07867281.3) covering isolated tumor antigens comprising alpha-Gal residues. The issued United States and European patents expire between 2027 and 2029. Additional patent applications have been filed covering the use of carbohydrate-modified glycoproteins (PCT/US2014/025702, PCT/US2013/026271) and US 13/463,420, and correlates of efficacy to tumor vaccine (PCT/US2014/038231).
A family of patents, which relate to the use of alpha-Gal in viral and cancer vaccines and which was previously a second principal family of patents for our HyperAcute product candidates and HyperAcute technology, has expired. The last remaining patent in such family, U.S. Patent No. 5,879,675, expired in March 2016 and our exclusive license from Drexel University to such patent family terminated.
In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets and know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of confidential information. The agreements also oblige our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign or license to us ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work with us. We cannot be sure that these agreements will maintain confidentiality, will prevent disclosure, or will protect our proprietary information or intellectual property, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property.
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and patents have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products or new technologies that may be competitive with those being developed by us. Therefore, any of our product candidates may give rise to claims that it infringes the patents or proprietary rights of other parties now or in the future. Furthermore, to the extent that we, our consultants, or manufacturing and research collaborators, use intellectual property owned by others in work performed for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights to such intellectual property or in related or resulting know-how and inventions. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties. A license required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be available to us, or 
14

may not be available on acceptable terms. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that we are prevented from the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in legal proceedings instituted before patent and trademark offices in the United States, the European Union, or other ex-U.S. territories, or in a suit brought against us by a private party based on such patents or proprietary rights, or in a suit by us asserting our patent or proprietary rights against another party, even if the outcome is not adverse to us.

LIMR Exclusive License Agreement (IDO-2)
We are a party to a license agreement, or the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement, executed December 21, 2007 with LIMR. The LIMR IDO-2 Agreement grants us an exclusive, worldwide license, under specified LIMR patent rights relating to inhibitors of the target Indoleamine 2,3 Dioxygenase-2, or IDO-2, and under related LIMR know-how or technology, to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale products and services that are covered by such patent rights, for all uses. Such license is subject to LIMR's retained non-exclusive right to use such LIMR patent rights and technical information for internal non-commercial, educational and research purposes only. In addition, the license is subject to certain rights of and obligations to the U.S. government under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding provided by a U.S. federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under the LIMR IDO-2 license, provided that each sublicense complies with the terms of the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement.
In consideration of such license grant, we have paid to LIMR an upfront license fee and annual license maintenance fees, and are obligated to pay LIMR annual license maintenance fees, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $1.52 million per licensed product, subject to reductions if milestones also qualify under the IDO-1 Agreement, and, if a licensed product is commercialized, royalties as a low single-digit percentage of “net sales” of the licensed product, subject to reduction for our royalty payments to third parties. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under the licenses granted by LIMR, we must pay to LIMR a percentage of the consideration paid by the sublicensee to us. The payment provisions of the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement provide that, in the event a product for which we have payment obligations under the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement is also covered by payment obligations under the LIMR IDO-1 Agreement, we will not be obligated to pay both such obligations but rather will pay to LIMR the higher of the amounts owed under the two agreements.
Under the LIMR IDO-2 Agreement, we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to develop and exploit products covered by the license. We have the obligation, at our expense and in our reasonable discretion, to conduct the prosecution and maintenance of the LIMR patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. In addition, LIMR granted us the exclusive option to obtain exclusive, worldwide licenses on commercially reasonable terms to future inventions and discoveries of LIMR related to IDO-2 or inhibitors of IDO-2.

Following is a licensing agreement covering technologies and intellectual property rights useful to our PTEN drug discovery program:
Augusta University Research Institute License Agreement (PTEN)
We are party to a License Agreement with AURI dated March 15, 2016, or the AURI PTEN License Agreement, pursuant to which AURI granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license, under specified AURI patents and related technology, to make, use, import, sell and offer for sale, in the cancer field, PTEN inhibitor products, or royalty-bearing products, that are covered by licensed patents or certain of our patents or that were researched or developed using licensed technology. Our license from AURI is subject to AURI's retained right to use such AURI patents and technology for research and educational purposes, including collaborative research with other academic institutions. In addition, the license is subject to certain rights of and obligations to the U.S. government under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding 
17

provided by a U.S. federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under such license, provided that each sublicense complies with the terms of the AURI PTEN Agreement.
Under the terms of the AURI PTEN License Agreement, we paid an upfront payment to AURI of $1.0 million and we are obligated to pay AURI potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $4.3 million and royalties at a single-digit or less percentage of net sales of royalty-bearing products. In addition, if we grant of a sublicense under the license granted by AURI or we grant a license to certain of our patents that cover royalty-bearing products, we must pay to AURI a percentage of certain specified consideration that we receive from the sublicensee or licensee. 
Under the AURI PTEN License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to bring at least one royalty-bearing product to market in a least one specified country for use in cancer. We can satisfy this obligation by spending a specified amount on research and development of royalty-bearing products within a specified period of time or by having a research or marketing program that meets certain criteria.
Unless terminated earlier, the AURI PTEN License Agreement will continue in effect for as long as we have royalty obligations under the AURI PTEN License Agreement. Our royalty obligations expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (1) expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patents or our patents covering such royalty-bearing product in such country and (2) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Each party may terminate the AURI PTEN License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. We may terminate the AURI PTEN License Agreement at will upon 30 days prior written notice. Unless the AURI PTEN License Agreement is terminated for AURI’s uncured material breach, the our obligation to pay milestones and royalties will not terminate upon early termination of the AURI PTEN License Agreement but will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of (a) expiration of the last valid claim of our patents covering such royalty-bearing product in such country and (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
Concurrent with the execution of the AURI PTEN License Agreement, we entered into a Research Services Agreement with AURI, or the AURI PTEN Research Services Agreement, pursuant to which AURI will perform certain research services directed to PTEN inhibitors as agreed by the parties from time to time during the term of the agreement in exchange for compensation to be agreed upon by the parties at such time. We will own all data and results generated by AURI under the AURI PTEN Research Services Agreement. All other know-how and all patents arising from AURI’s work under the AURI PTEN Research Services Agreement will be included in the exclusive license that we receive from AURI under the AURI PTEN License Agreement. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of the parties, the AURI PTEN Research Services Agreement will expire after two years. 
Following are licensing agreements to which BPS is a party covering technologies and intellectual property rights applicable to BPS’s development of vaccines for the biodefense field:
Public Health Agency of Canada License Agreement
BPS is a party to a license agreement dated May 4, 2010, with PHAC, or the PHAC License. The PHAC License grants BPS a worldwide, personal, non-transferable, sole, revocable, royalty-bearing license for commercialization of specified Canada patent rights relating to technology based on rVSV. The license is subject to Canada's retained right to use the PHAC patent rights and technology to improve the patent rights, carry out educational purposes, and development of the patent rights where BPS cannot obtain regulatory approval or meet demand. BPS may grant sublicenses under the PHAC License, provided that each sublicense is consistent with the terms and conditions of the PHAC License and contain certain mandatory sublicensing provisions.
In consideration of the license grant, BPS must pay to Canada specified patent and signing fees, annual license maintenance fees, patent prosecution costs, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately C$205,000 per licensed product, and royalties as a low single-digit percentage of the sales price of the licensed products sold by BPS, which royalty rate varies depending on the type of licensed product. In addition, if BPS grants a sublicense under the licenses granted by Canada, BPS is required to pay to Canada a percentage of certain consideration BPS receives from the sublicensee. BPS is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market the licensed products. If BPS breaches its obligations and fails to cure the breach, PHAC may terminate the PHAC License.
In November 2014, we entered into a licenses and collaboration agreement with Merck to develop and potentially commercialize our Ebola vaccine product candidate. The Merck Agreement includes a sublicense of the patents subject to the PHAC License. 
Unless terminated earlier, the PHAC License will remain in effect until the expiration of the last of the PHAC patent rights. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we currently expect the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2023, excluding any patent term 
18

adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. Canada may terminate this agreement for BPS's failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize, failure to pay, breach of confidentiality, cessation of business, criminal conviction or other breach of its obligations under the agreement. BPS may not assign the PHAC License to a third party without the prior written consent of Canada, not to be unreasonably withheld. This agreement will terminate automatically if we assign the PHAC License without prior written consent or if BPS files for bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
The Ohio State University License Agreement
We are a party to a license agreement dated June 28, 2013 with The Ohio State University, or OSU. This agreement grants us exclusive rights in the United States and its territories, in all fields of use, to patents related to pharmaceutical compositions and vaccines comprising antigens associated with L-Rhamnose and Forssman epitopes, including patent application US 13/463,420, which is co-owned by us and OSU.
In consideration of the license grant, we are obligated to pay OSU specified license fees and are obligated to pay to OSU specified annual license maintenance fees, patent prosecution and maintenance costs, potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount up to approximately $2.75 million for the first licensed product, and royalties as a low single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed products if a licensed product is commercialized, with minimum royalties for the first three years in which a licensed product generates revenue. In addition, if we grant a sublicense under this agreement, we must also pay to OSU a percentage of certain consideration received by us from the sublicensee. Under this agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and market the licensed products and to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain milestones by agreed-upon deadlines.
Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will continue until the expiration of the last licensed patent rights which extend until 2024. We may terminate the agreement at any time for any reason with 90 days prior written notice. OSU may immediately terminate the agreement if we materially breach our obligations to OSU and do not cure the breach within the specified period, or if we or our affiliates or sublicensees participates in a challenge to the validity, enforceability or scope of the licensed patents. The agreement will also terminate if we agree with OSU that the agreement should be terminated or if we cease business operations or become involved in any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation-related activities.  If the agreement is terminated, we will lose our license from OSU to the licensed patents but we will retain our rights as owners of all licensed patents that are co-owned by us and OSU.
Following are licensing agreements covering technologies and intellectual property rights useful to our HyperAcute product candidates and technologies:
Central Iowa Health System License Agreement
We are a party to a license agreement, or the CIHS Agreement, dated August 2, 2001, as amended on December 30, 2013 with the Central Iowa Health System, or CIHS. The CIHS Agreement grants to us an exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale products that are covered by certain CIHS patent rights, proprietary information or know-how relating to our HyperAcute immunotherapy technology. The license is subject to CIHS's retained right to use, and to permit other academic and research institutions to use, the CIHS patent rights and information for non-commercial bona fide research purposes. The license is also subject to certain rights of and obligations to the United States government under applicable law, to the extent that such intellectual property was created using funding provided by a United States federal agency. We may grant sublicenses under the license, so long as the sublicense is subordinate to, and complies with, the CIHS Agreement.
In partial consideration of the license under the CIHS Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with CIHS, under which we issued to CIHS shares of our common stock and granted CIHS certain rights related to ownership of such shares. In addition, we must reimburse CIHS for out-of-pocket costs incurred for patent prosecution and maintenance. If we or our sublicensees commercialize a licensed product, we also have the obligation to pay CIHS royalties as a low single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed product, subject to annual minimum royalties and a reduction for any royalty payments we must make to third parties. If we grant a sublicense under the licenses granted by CIHS, we must pay to CIHS, in addition to the royalties described above, a percentage of certain consideration paid by the sublicensee to us. We have no obligation to pay fees to CIHS as a result of payments between us and our affiliates.
Under the CIHS Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and to launch and market such products in specified markets. As part of such efforts, we must deliver to CIHS certain information including an annual progress report detailing our progress towards commercial use of licensed products. At specific dates after the effective date we must satisfy certain obligations to conduct specified development on the licensed product, expend specified amounts on development of the licensed technology, or raise specific minimum amounts of equity capital. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate appropriate sponsored research programs 
19

with researchers at CIHS. If CIHS concludes that we have not met any of these obligations, and we fail to cure such failure, CIHS may either terminate the agreement or convert the license to a non-exclusive license. In addition, if CIHS determines that we have failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to, or to grant sublicenses to, develop or commercialize a licensed product in a particular field within the licensed field of use and we fail to cure such failure, CIHS may terminate, or convert the license to a non-exclusive license with respect to such particular field.
Unless terminated earlier, the CIHS Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty obligations under the agreement. Our royalty obligations expire on a country-by-country and a licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (1) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents covering a licensed product in a country or (2) 12 years following the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country. Pending the status of certain patent applications and the payment of appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees, we expect that the last patent will expire under this agreement in 2023, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions or additional patents issued that are included under the license. Upon expiration of the CIHS Agreement we will retain a fully-paid, nonexclusive license under the licensed technology to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import licensed products. We may terminate the agreement, or specific patents covered by the agreement, after written notice to CIHS or for CIHS' uncured material breach of the agreement. CIHS has the right to terminate for our uncured material breach of the agreement after written notice. Upon termination of the agreement we may sell our existing inventory of licensed products for a period of three months after such termination. We have the right to assign the CIHS Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets relating to the agreement, but any other assignment requires CIHS' written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
On December 30, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the CIHS Agreement, or the CIHS Amendment. Under the terms of the CIHS Amendment, certain provisions of the CIHS Agreement were amended, in part to clarify that we are not obligated to pay fees to CIHS as a result of payments between us and our affiliates with respect to the intellectual property rights licensed by CIHS to us pursuant to the CIHS Agreement. The CIHS Amendment includes, without limitation, clarifications to (1) the definitions of “Third Party(ies)” and “Net Sales”, (2) provisions with respect to our obligations to take actions to enable CIHS to meet its obligations under certain federal statutes and (3) provisions with respect to the sublicensing fee payable by us to CIHS. In addition, the CIHS Amendment updates the list of patents that are licensed to us under the CIHS Agreement. We entered into the CIHS Amendment in connection with our sublicensing of certain intellectual property to our wholly owned foreign subsidiary.
Government Regulation
We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and the Public Health Service Act, among others.
The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these laws and regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologic license applications, or BLAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other 
20

information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, good clinical practices, or GCP, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential Phases, but the Phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. 
In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target disease, these studies may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1B clinical trials. Additionally, when product candidates can do damage to normal cells, it is not ethical to administer such drugs to healthy patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The marketing application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. Submission of an NDA or BLA also requires the payment of a substantial user fee, unless a waiver applies.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of marketing applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within 10 months of their acceptance for filing, and for priority designated applications, within six months of their acceptance for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. The FDA may also inspect one or more non-clinical study sites to assurance compliance with GLP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the proposed facility or the facilities at which the drug substance or drug product is manufactured, tested, packaged or labeled. The FDA will not approve the product unless it has compliance with GCP, GLP, and current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, is satisfactory and the marketing application (the NDA or, in the case of biologics, the BLA) contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication or indications studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with FDA's general biological product standards to demonstrate that the product is safe, pure and potent.
21

After the FDA evaluates the marketing application and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an Approval Letter, or a Complete Response letter. A Complete Response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed in a resubmission of the marketing application, FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an Approval Letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual for the FDA to issue a Complete Response letter because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive.
An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indication or indications. As a condition of approval of the marketing application, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for marketing of a drug or biologic through an NDA or BLA, respectively, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or FDA approved method of using this product. Upon approval of a product, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA applicant and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA applicant and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug.
Ongoing Regulatory Requirements
Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer 
22

advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indication or indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, or in the case of biologics, a new BLA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for our product candidates for any other indications or any other product candidate for any indication on a timely basis, if at all.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced, routine or for-cause inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to access compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
Federal and State Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to increase the transparency of and restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years. These laws include the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes.
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, are also applicable to our business. We could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and was amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. There are also state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Regulation Outside the United States
Drugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain approval in the United States, we will be subject to separate regulatory approval standards in foreign countries. In the E.U., for example, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries of the E.U. (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the E.U. can be used to obtain approval in another country of the E.U. under two simplified application processes, the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, 
23

both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After regulatory approval is received through any of the European registration procedures, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries.
Price Controls
In many of the markets where we may do business in the future, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. In the United States, the Medicare program is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS and pursuant to CMS's subregulatory coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict how CMS may apply those regulations and subregulatory determinations to newly approved products, especially novel products, and those regulations and interpretive determinations are subject to change. Moreover, the methodology under which CMS makes coverage and reimbursement determinations is subject to change, particularly because of budgetary pressures facing the Medicare program. Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations also may determine who may be reimbursed for certain services.
In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom, which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Legal Proceedings
In addition to the legal proceedings described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe we are party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016 we had 122 employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Facilities 
Our executive offices and manufacturing facilities are located in the Iowa State University Research Park in Ames, Iowa. In June 2010, we completed the expansion of approximately 23,500 square foot facility, which includes executive offices as well as approximately 14,000 feet dedicated to manufacturing, testing and product storage. The manufacturing portion of the facility became operational on October 17, 2010. The lease expires January 31, 2020, and we have the option to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods upon the same terms as the base lease.
On November 14, 2011, we entered into a Memorandum of Agreement, or the Memorandum, with Iowa State University Research Park Corporation, or ISURP. The Memorandum is an addendum to the lease, or the Lease, dated September 30, 2009 between us and ISURP covering our facilities in Ames, Iowa. The Memorandum added approximately 26,600 square feet of additional space to the Lease. During 2012 operating rents to ISURP increased by $211,000. During 2012, ISURP provided a building allowance of $622,000 and assisted in securing an additional $456,000 in debt financing for us. This lease for the initial 
24

14,800 square feet expired on February 28, 2017 but was subsequently extended through February 1, 2018. The remaining 11,800 square feet will expire on March 31, 2018.
On December 29, 2014, we added an additional 6,770 square feet of offices located in the Iowa State University Research Park in Ames, Iowa. On July 9, 2015 we added 2,070 square feet of offices adjacent to the 6,770 square feet. Both leases expire January 31, 2018. 
On February 24, 2014, we signed a lease for 6,430 square feet of additional executive and administrative offices in Austin, Texas and amended the lease in February 2015. On February 16, 2015, we added an additional 3,468 square feet to the Austin facility. The lease expired September 30, 2016 and we amended the lease and moved into a smaller space with 2,686 square feet.
On August 25, 2014, we entered into a lease for 47,250 square feet of space in Ankeny, Iowa where we planned to manage the final production steps, including irradiation and packaging, and to distribute our potential HyperAcute product candidates, if any are approved. We currently have no plans to use this space for such purposes. The lease expires October 31, 2017.
On December 15, 2014, we entered into a lease for 1,310 square feet of office space in Devens, Massachusetts to support our development efforts related to our Ebola vaccine product candidate. The lease expired December 14, 2015 and we are currently leasing the space under a monthly lease.
