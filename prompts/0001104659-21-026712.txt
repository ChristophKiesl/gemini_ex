Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Enzon,” “we” or “us”) is positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and more fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and enhance stockholder value.
 
In September 2020, we initiated a rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) for our common and preferred stock (see below and Note 14 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), which closed in October 2020, and we realized $43.6 million in gross proceeds. This has enabled us to embark on our plan to realize the value of our approximately $103 million NOLs by acquiring potentially profitable businesses or assets. To protect the NOLs, in August 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 rights plan (see Note 13 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
 
Historically, we have received royalty revenues from licensing arrangements with other companies primarily related to sales of certain drug products that utilized Enzon’s proprietary technology. In recent years, we have had no clinical operations and limited corporate operations. We have a marketing agreement relating to the drug Vicineum, which, if approved, will potentially generate milestone and royalty payments to us in the future. We cannot assure you that we will earn material future royalties or milestones.
 
Corporate Events
 
On August 4, 2020, our Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jordan Bleznick and Mr. Randolph C. Read as directors to the Board, effective August 4, 2020, to fill the vacancies created by the resignations of Mr. Jonathan Christodoro and Dr. Odysseas Kostas as of the same date. At the annual stockholders’ meeting held on December 18, 2020, Messrs. Bleznick and Read and Ms. McNealey were elected as directors to the Board and will each serve until the next annual meeting of our stockholders and until such director’s successor is elected and qualified, subject to such director’s earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Currently, our Finance and Audit Committee consists of Mr. Read, as chairman, and Ms. McNealey. Mr. Read was determined by the Board of Directors to qualify as an “audit committee financial expert,” as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.
 
Mr. Bleznick was appointed by our Board of Directors after discussions with Mr. Carl C. Icahn, who, with his affiliates, is currently the Company’s largest stockholder, and after consideration by the Governance and Nominating Committee. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Bleznick and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Bleznick was selected as a director. Mr. Read was appointed by the Board after consideration by the Governance and Nominating Committee. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Read and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Read was selected as a director.
 
On January 4, 2021, we announced that Mr. Andrew Rackear had, on December 30, 2020, communicated to the Board his intent to retire from his role as our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) effective February 26, 2021. On December 30, 2020, we also announced that Mr. Richard L. Feinstein, Enzon’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), was appointed as CEO and Secretary, effective February 26, 2021, and would remain as the Company’s CFO.

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights
 
We have a portfolio of issued U.S. patents, many of which have foreign counterparts. Of the patents owned or exclusively licensed by us, one relates to PegIntron. The patent related to PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b) expired in the United States in 2016 and expired outside of the United States in 2018 (including any patent term extensions), except for Japan, where the patent was extended until 2021, Malaysia, where the patent expired in 2020, and Chile, where it will expire in 2024. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition and we may be entitled to potential royalty rights and/or milestone payments, we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, will afford us adequate protection from competing products, or will not be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us. At this time, we do not expect to apply for or receive any additional patents.
 
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Many of our patents have expired or are nearing the end of their patent protection period. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 
Prior to 2017, we received royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”). In 2019 and 2020 net royalties from PegIntron have not been significant. There is a dispute with Merck regarding royalties (see Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). We have a licensing agreement regarding SC Oncaspar and certain other drugs.
