Superior Products: | With a focus on our core products, we provide customers with market-leading solutions with predicable quality that meet or exceed their expectations. 
World-Class Operations: | We are committed to driving sustained excellence through the Cooper Standard Operating System (“CSOS”), our customized set of global best business practices. It is how we will continue to optimize performance on a global scale. 
Engaged Employees: | Our employees are the foundation of the Company and the key factor to our success. Committed to excellence and driven to succeed, our employees are focused on the Company’s overall vision and strategy. 

Cooper Standard’s global alignment around these strategic pillars continues to drive further value in many areas of the business, including: 
Operational and Strategic Initiatives
As part of Cooper Standard’s world-class operations, the Company implemented CSOS to fully position the Company for growth and ensure global consistency in engineering design, program management, manufacturing process, purchasing and IT systems. Standardization across all regions is especially critical in support of customers’ global platforms that require the same design, quality and delivery standards everywhere across the world. Cooper Standard operates Global Councils focused on technology, customer and manufacturing initiatives to better leverage the scale of the Company, identify best practices and transfer them around the world. As a result of these initiatives, the Company has leveraged CSOS to drive an average savings from improved operating efficiency of approximately $75 million each of the past five years. 
Cooper Standard continues to progress its diversification strategy through its Advanced Technology Group which is charged with accelerating and maximizing expertise in the Company’s core process types for applications in the industrial and specialty markets. This business also drives growth and diversification through the Company’s applied materials science offerings, which include the Fortrex™ chemistry platform that provides performance advantages over many other materials.
The Company’s CS Open Innovation initiative aims to position Cooper Standard as the partner of choice for start-ups, universities and other suppliers through a proactive outreach program. The initiative is focused in the areas of materials science, manufacturing and process technology, digital/artificial intelligence and advanced product technology. 
In addition, the Company has recently implemented a defined, focused plan to return to double-digit ROIC to help deliver sustained value for all of our stakeholders.
Leverage Technology and Materials Science for Innovative Solutions
We utilize our technical and materials science expertise to provide customers with innovative solutions. Our engineers combine product design with a broad understanding of materials science for enhanced vehicle performance. We believe our reputation for successful innovation in product design and materials is the reason our customers consult us early in their vehicle development and design process of their next generation vehicles.
Cooper Standard utilizes its i Innovation Process (Imagine, Initiate, Innovate) and CS Open Innovation as mechanisms to capture ideas while promoting a culture of innovation. Ideas are carefully evaluated by our global technology council, and those that are selected are put on an accelerated development cycle. We are developing innovative technologies based on materials expertise, process know-how, and application vision, which may drive future product direction. Fortrex™, the 
Company’s chemistry platform, offers reduced weight while delivering superior material performance and aesthetics. We have also developed several other significant technologies, especially related to advanced materials, processing and weight reduction. These include: FlushSeal™, an advanced integrated solution for frame under glass static sealing systems offering better appearance, improved aerodynamics, quieter ride and reduced weight; MagAlloy™, a processing technology for brake lines that increases long term durability through superior corrosion resistance and Easy-Lock™, a small package coolant and fuel vapor quick connect. Given the trajectory and anticipated future growth of electric vehicles Cooper Standard has developed innovations to provide lightweight plastic tubing with our PC2000 multilayer tubing, smooth and CVT mid temperature multilayer tubing, and our next generation ErgoLock™ VDA quick connectors for glycol thermal management needs.
Among our newer technologies is Cooper Standard’s artificial intelligence (A.I.)-enhanced development cycle for polymer compounds that has shortened material development times while realizing rapid discovery of new compounds that offer superior performance properties, which yield superior products. We have also developed proprietary technology for A.I.-enhanced continuous processes controls. This technology enables full automation of polymer extrusion and other complex continuous processes, reducing process variation (a top driver of scrap), increasing product quality, improving operational metrics and reducing our carbon footprint.
Our innovations are receiving industry recognition. Cooper Standard’s artificial intelligence-enhanced development cycle for polymer compound development was named a finalist for the 2019 Automotive News PACE Awards. In addition, Fortrex™ was named a 2018 PACE Award winner and a 2018 and 2019 Society of Plastics Engineers Innovation Award finalist.
Pursue Acquisitions and Alliances to Enhance Capabilities and Accelerate Growth
Our strong balance sheet allows us to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures to enhance our customer base, geographic penetration, scale and technology. Consolidation is an industry trend, which has been encouraged by the OEMs’ desire for global automotive suppliers. We believe we have a strong platform for growth through acquisitions based on our past integration successes, experienced management team, global presence and operational excellence. 
Industry
The automotive industry is one of the world’s largest and most competitive. Consumer demand for new vehicles largely determines sales and production volumes of global OEMs. The business and commercial environment in each region also plays a role in vehicle demand as it relates to fleet vehicle sales and industrial use vehicles such as light and heavy trucks.
OEMs compete for market share in a variety of ways including pricing and incentives, the development of new, more attractive models, branding and advertising, and the ability to customize vehicle features and options to meet specific customer needs or demands. They rely heavily on thousands of specialized suppliers to provide the many distinct components and systems that comprise the modern vehicle. They also rely on these automotive suppliers to develop technological innovations that will help them meet consumer demands as well as regulatory requirements. 
The supplier industry is a highly competitive industry generally characterized by high barriers to entry, significant start-up costs and long-standing customer relationships. The criteria by which OEMs judge automotive suppliers include quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and global footprint. Over the last decade, suppliers that have been able to achieve manufacturing scale globally, reduce structural costs, diversify their customer base and provide innovative, value-added technologies have been the most successful.
The technology of today’s vehicles is evolving rapidly. This evolution is being driven by many factors including consumer preferences and social behaviors, a competitive drive for differentiation, regulatory requirements, environmental impact and safety. Cooper Standard supports these trends by providing innovations that reduce weight, increase life-cycle and durability, reduce interior noise, enhance exterior appearance and simplify the manufacturing and assembly process. These are innovations that can be applicable and valuable to virtually any vehicle (including fuel, hybrid or electric-powered powertrains) or vehicle manufacturer and, in many cases, can also be transferred to non-automotive applications in adjacent markets. Cooper Standard remains closely aligned with our customers and is prepared to meet their evolving needs as they shift their fleets and offer more electric vehicle options. We are focused on growing our business in this segment by leveraging our technology and innovation to provide value-add solutions for increasingly specialized technical requirements. 
Markets Served
Our automotive business is focused on the passenger car and light truck market, up to and including Class 3 full-size, full-frame trucks, better known as the global light vehicle market. This is our largest market and accounts for approximately 92% of our global sales. 
Customers
We are a leading supplier to the following OEMs and are increasing our presence with major OEMs throughout the world. The following charts show the percentage of sales to our top customers for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Our other customers include OEMs such as Renault-Nissan, BMW, Toyota, Volvo, Jaguar/Land Rover, Honda and various other OEMs based in China. Our business with any given customer is typically split among several contracts for different parts on a number of platforms.
Subsequent Events
In January 2021, one of the Company’s top customers announced restructuring activities in South America including their intention to cease manufacturing operations in Brazil. As a result, Cooper Standard’s Brazil manufacturing operations and sales attributable to that customer will be significantly impacted. The Company is assessing the impact of this announcement on our 2021 financial results, but does not expect the action to have a material impact on the business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In January 2021, two of the Company’s top customers, FCA and Groupe PSA, completed a merger. The combined business was renamed Stellantis. The Company does not expect this merger to have a material impact on the business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
Products
We currently have three distinct product lines: sealing systems; fuel and brake delivery systems; and fluid transfer systems. These products are produced and supplied globally to a broad range of customers in multiple markets. On April 1, 2019, we completed the divestiture of the AVS product line within our North America, Europe and Asia Pacific segments. On July 1, 2020, we completed the divestiture of the European rubber fluid transfer and specialty sealing businesses, as well as our Indian operations.

(Dollar amounts in millions)
2020 | $ | 101.6 | | 4.3 | %
2019 | $ | 114.9 | | 3.7 | %
2018 | $ | 122.5 | | 3.4 | %

Intellectual Property
We believe that one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to translate customer needs and our ideas into innovation through the development of intellectual property. We hold a significant number of patents and trademarks worldwide.
Our patents are grouped into two major categories: (1) specific product invention claims and (2) specific manufacturing processes that are used for producing products. The vast majority of our patents fall within the product invention category. We consider these patents to be of value and seek to protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. While in the aggregate these patents are important to our business, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any one patent would materially affect our Company. We continue to seek patent protection for our new products and we develop significant technologies that we treat as trade secrets and choose not to disclose to the public through the patent process. These technologies nonetheless provide significant competitive advantages and contribute to our global leadership position in various markets. We believe that our trademarks, including FlushSeal™, Gen III Posi-Lock™, Easy-Lock™, MagAlloy™, Ergo-Lock™, PC2000 and Fortrex™, help differentiate us and lead customers to seek our partnership.
We also have technology sharing and licensing agreements with various third parties, including Nishikawa Rubber Company, one of our joint venture partners in sealing products. We have mutual agreements with Nishikawa Rubber Company for sales, marketing and engineering services on certain sealing products. Under those agreements, each party pays for services provided by the other and royalties on certain products for which the other party provides design or development services. We also have licensing and joint development agreements for commercial applications of our Fortrex™ chemistry platform in non-automotive industries.
Supplies and Raw Materials
Cooper Standard is committed to building strong relationships with our supply partners. We recognize the importance of engaging with suppliers to create value for our customers.
The principle raw materials for our business include synthetic and natural rubber, carbon black, process oils, and plastic resins. Principle procured components are primarily made from plastic, carbon steel, aluminum and stainless steel. We manage the procurement of our direct and indirect materials to assure supply continuity and to obtain the most favorable total cost. 
Procurement arrangements include short-term and long-term supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing, based on commodity indices. These arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our products with suppliers located around the world, although we continue to manage, with our supplier partners, short-term disruptions in production and logistics throughout our supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Raw material prices are susceptible to fluctuations which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. Costs related to raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and oil and oil-derived commodities, continue to be volatile. As such, we have implemented strategies with both our suppliers and our customers to help manage these fluctuations. These actions include material substitutions and leveraging global purchases. Our global supply chain optimization efforts include using benchmarks and selective sourcing from strategic suppliers. We have also made process improvements to ensure the efficient use of materials through scrap reduction, as well as standardization of material specifications to maximize leverage over higher volume purchases. With some customers, on certain raw materials, we have implemented indices that allow price changes as underlying material costs fluctuate. 
Seasonality
Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Sales to OEMs are lowest during the months prior to model changeovers or during assembly plant shutdowns. Automotive production is traditionally reduced during July, August and year-end holidays, and our quarterly results may reflect these trends. However, economic conditions and consumer demand may change the traditional seasonality of the industry.
Backlog
Our OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a firm and definitive backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally six to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur.
Human Capital and Safety
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 25,000 employees, including 3,100 contingent workers. We maintain good relations with both our union and non-union employees and, in the past ten years, have not experienced any major work stoppages. We renegotiated some of our domestic and non-domestic union agreements in 2020, and have several contracts set to expire in the next twelve months. 
The attraction, retention and development of our employees is critical to our success. We accomplish this by developing the capabilities of our employees through continuous learning and performance management processes. Additionally, building an internal talent pipeline supports the achievement of this priority. In 2020, our internal fill rate was approximately 56%. This metric, which is based on salaried director level positions and above, helps us to understand where employees are advancing in their career and the effectiveness of our internal development programs. Our voluntary employee turnover rate was approximately 13%. We believe that our culture and continued effort to provide our employees with growth opportunities contributes to retaining our strong talent. 
In addition, we aim to diversify our workforce because we recognize the value of engaging different opinions and backgrounds in a global company. We are committed to recruiting, developing and retaining a high-performing and diverse workforce. A global measurement for our diversity is women in the company and women in leadership. In 2020, women made up approximately 36% of our workforce. Of our leadership positions, defined as vice president positions and above, women held approximately 20% of such roles. 
Safety continues to be a top priority and primary focus of management. An emphasis on reducing workplace incidents helps Cooper Standard to maintain a safe workforce and continue to deliver world class results for product quality. In 2020, our total incident rate (“TIR”) was 0.32, which represents an Occupational Safety and Health Administration measurement of on-the-job injuries in relation to total hours worked. Based on our review of industry peer sustainability reports, we have a lower TIR relative to our peer group. Additionally, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers. After the onset of COVID-19, we adopted enhanced safety measures and practices across our facilities to protect employee health and safety and ensure a reliable supply of products to our customers. We monitor and track the impact of the pandemic on our employees and within our operations and proactively modify or adopt new practices to promote their health and safety.
Also in 2020, the Company was named to Newsweek’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies for the second consecutive year and was recognized as one of the 2020 World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. These awards are further testament to Cooper Standard’s commitment to ESG (environmental, social and governance) topics, including our core value of integrity. 
Community Involvement
Supported by the Cooper Standard Foundation, our employees are highly engaged in their local communities. The Foundation’s mission is to strengthen the communities where Cooper Standard employees work and live through the passionate support of children’s charities, education, health and wellness, and community revitalization. The Cooper Standard Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization with oversight by our Philanthropic Committee and Board of Trustees. For more information on the Company’s community involvement, please visit our Corporate Responsibility Report located on the Cooper Standard website. 
Environmental
Cooper Standard considers itself a steward of the environment, and we monitor the environmental impact of our business and products. We prioritize our environmental management as a means of driving and sustaining excellence. We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, including regulations governing: emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and human health and safety. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While our costs to defend and settle known claims arising under environmental laws have not been material in the past and are not currently estimated to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, such costs could be material to our financial statements in the future. Further details regarding our commitments and contingencies are provided in Note 23. “Contingent Liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Report”).
