ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
WindGen Energy Inc. (the “Company”) intends to acquire technology (the “Technology”) from DASH B.S.T. Ltd, an Israeli entity that has developed next-generation solar energy solutions to underrepresented and/or growing market segments. The Company is currently targeting high-growth agriculture solar market segments for its advanced solar power generation systems (“solar systems”). The Company is prepared for conducting business in multiple locations throughout the United States and possibly Israel. Our business office is located at 8432 East Shea Blvd, #101, Scottsdale, Arizona 85250. Our Technology development office is located at 33 Ozer Haim St, Petah Tiqwa, Israel 4936157
 WindGen Energy, Inc. (“WindGen” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a Utah corporation on June 16, 1983 under the name of InMedica Development Corporation. On December 4, 2009, a majority of the Company’s shareholders executed a consent resolution to amend the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to WindGen Energy, Inc. (“WindGen” or the “Company”) and to increase the number of authorized common stock shares from 40,000,000 to 100,000,000. A Certificate of Amendment for such amendments was filed by the Company with the Secretary of State of Utah effective on December 16, 2009. The name changes and the new trading symbol, “WGEI,” was approved by FINRA on March 16, 2010.
 
Beginning in January 2009 through 2019, management refocused the Company on small turbine wind energy devices. On April 17, 2009, we entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Wind Sail Receptor, Inc. of Boulder City, Nevada (“WSR”), pursuant to which we were granted the exclusive license to assemble and market WSR’s wind sail receptor energy generation devices using blades of 15 feet or less in length in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland, with nonexclusive rights in the rest of the world except Latin America. Under the License Agreement, we were to acquire 100 blades from WSR during the first year after WSR is able to manufacture the blades.
 
During 2010, the Company issued 1,900,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock to WSR in consideration of amending the License Agreement. The proposed amendment to the License Agreement between the Company and WSR was not executed. The reasons are various and include, but are not limited to, finalizing details regarding the need for the Company to be involved in assembly of the wind turbines in various license territories outside the US, final pricing that the units will be sold by WSR to the Company, final terms of the product Warranty to be provided by WSR, and possible additional exclusive territory added to the License. 
 
On March 20, 2012, the Company entered into two new agreements with WSR. These two agreements replaced the exclusive sales and distribution License Agreement previously held by the Company. One agreement is a perpetual royalty agreement whereby WSR will pay to the Company a royalty on each Wind Sail Receptor Small Wind Turbine System sold in the United States and Canada. The royalty amounts payable are $250 for three-foot blade diameter units sold, $500 for six-foot blade diameter units sold and $1,500 for twelve-foot blade diameter units sold. A further provision of the new agreement with WSR returns the 1,900,000 restricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock. These shares were canceled on the books and records of the Company reducing the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The second agreement awarded the Company a dealership for the exclusive sale and distribution of the Wind Sail Receptor Small Wind Turbines with a blade diameter not to exceed twelve feet for the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. To date WSR has not sold any of its small wind turbines and the Company has not received any royalties from sales. The two agreements remain in full force and effect. 
 
The Company’s common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Market’s Pink Sheets under the symbol “WGEIPK”.

Recent Developments
 
On August 11, 2021, the Company entered into a binding letter of intent with DASH B.S.T. Ltd to acquire its proprietary solar energy technology focused on the agriculture greenhouse market segment. The Company intends to enter into a definitive Purchase Agreement not later than October 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 the Company has not yet entered into a definitive Purchase Agreement with DASH B.S.T. Ltd while on final approval of the DASH B.S.T. Ltd Israel Patent.
 
On August 11, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously elected Shomron Dasht as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors pursuant to the terms of the August 9, 2021 binding letter of intent between the Company and DASH B.S.T. Ltd.
 
Business Overview
 
WindGen Energy Inc is currently focused on providing access to solar energy for agriculture greenhouse energy consumers. The Company is prepared for conducting business in multiple locations throughout the United States and possibly Israel. 
 
The Company has been involved primarily in organizational activities associated with finalizing the development of the Technology and creating a final marketing plan to sell its solar power systems. The Company intends to developed relationships with selective existing distributors of agriculture greenhouse solar solutions. The Company hopes to leverage these relationships to offer for sale and installation of its unique solar energy solutions. 
 
The Company currently has no manufacturing or installation capabilities and will rely upon third-parties for manufacturing and installation of our solar systems. Each sale and installation affiliate will be paid on a project-by-project basis in installments as they complete various phases of the project and reach applicable milestones within each respective distribution agreement. However, we have not yet entered into any specific distribution agreements so therefore we cannot predict exactly what such terms will be or if any if these relationships will produce any revenue.
 Applications of Solar Energy in Agriculture
 Energy is one of the highest overhead costs in agriculture, more so for farmers with greenhouses. Traditional sources of power, such as fossil fuels, harm the environment affecting agriculture. Therefore, adopting solar energy for agriculture alleviates the costs, and it is good for the environment. 
 Also, reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable as the resource are declining. Solar energy comes from a never-ending resource. Following are some possible applications of solar energy in agriculture. 
 Solar Energy-Powered Water Pumps
 In most areas without access to electricity, Photovoltaic (“PV”) water pumping systems are effective. Additionally, these systems provide water to remote pastures.
 Usually, simple PV systems are designed to work when the sun is shining, providing water where needed. In these cases, solar storage batteries are unnecessary because farmers store the water in tanks or pump it directly to fields. However, larger systems can use tracking mounts, storage channels, and inverters.
 Farmers who install a large-sized PV system do little maintenance because the power is reliable throughout. These systems are useful for irrigation, livestock water supply, pond aeration, and many others.

Water and Space Heating
 Livestock and dairy operations have varying space and water heating demands. Modern-day farmers rear animals such as cattle and poultry in enclosed structures. Due to this, the needs for temperature and air quality control are vital for such buildings. To remove moisture, dust, and toxic odors, the farmer needs to replace air regularly.
 Also, heating such large spaces requires a considerable amount of energy. Incorporating a well-designed solar energy system can heat the air even before it gets into the building. The system can also supply additional ventilation.
 Apart from heating spaces, solar is applied in agriculture to heat water. A solar water heating system reduces the costs for the farm. Mostly, in dairy farms where energy costs are high by 40%.
 Crop and Grain Drying
 Using the sun for drying grains is one of the oldest uses of solar energy in agriculture. The least expensive and most simple technology is where farmers spread fruit and grain in the sun to dry naturally. Sadly, elements such as wind, dust, and animals such as rodents can contaminate the crops.
 Thanks to innovation, there are efficient solar dryers that can protect the produce. As a result, you prevent crop losses, and the crops dry evenly and much faster. Additionally, the crops have better quality than open field drying.
 A solar dryer’s components are a shed or an enclosure, screened drying racks or trays, and a solar collector. It is glazed on the south of the shed, allowing sunlight to dry the crops. The air is then heated in the air collector, where it moves naturally or a fan forces it.
 Currently, there are few solar grain dryers in the world. However, its application in agriculture helps farmers find an effective way to dry perishable goods.
 Green House Heating
 Another way farmers rely on solar energy in agriculture is in greenhouse heating. Typically, commercial greenhouses use sunlight for lighting and not for heating. Mostly, they depend on oil and gases for maintaining the required temperatures for plant growth.
 Solar greenhouse heating systems provide heat and light. A solar greenhouse has a solar mass to collect and store the energy. Also, it contains insulation, thus retaining heat during cold days and nights.
 Ideally, the structure maximally utilizes southern glazing exposure. The northern side is well insulated as it has little or no glazing. The glazing is more effective in reducing heat loss. Using a solar greenhouse is the right choice for small growers instead of relying on fossil fuels.
 Remote Supply of Electricity
 Photovoltaic systems generate electricity from sunlight. In places where there are no utility power lines, these systems can be quite useful. They are also much cheaper than using fossil fuels, and they require low maintenance.
 Some farms are located in such areas, thus making solar panels an ideal option. Most of these farms have installed solar panels to provide lighting for the farm and home appliances. They are also useful in electric fencing, opening gates, automating feeding, and many other farm functions.
 Cooling Application
 Cooling in agriculture is still a niche market though it continues to grow. PVs can also be used to refrigerate farm yields, which prevents them from going bad. Cooling is an energy-intensive process. However, in rural areas, solar refrigeration options provide an effective clean energy option. It enables production at low costs as well as reduces spoilage leading to higher yields for farmers.

Conclusion
 Agriculture significantly suffers from unreliable power. Some farmers have faced severe losses as a result. Solar energy for agriculture is relatively cheaper than traditional sources of electricity.
 Also, solar energy used for agricultural activities can be instrumental in solving drought-related issues. In areas with water scarcity, using solar energy, especially for pumping water or irrigation, can help mitigate the problem. Farmers can also experience technological advancement as the industry can become more receptive to innovation.
 Solar also solves the issue of interrupted power supply. Solar power, coupled with an effective energy storage system guarantees the farmer readily available electricity. The energy is undoubtedly one of the most important resources to be adopted in agriculture.
 Lastly, farmers are the most affected group when it comes to global warming. Therefore, they need to be at the center of adopting sustainable energy growth. Solar energy offers limitless opportunities in farming.
 Agriculture Greenhouse Solar Systems
 
The agriculture industry is becoming more and more technology oriented while at the same time technology is becoming more cost effective for farmers to use in their day-to-day operations. In particular the use of microclimate-controlled environmental greenhouses is becoming more and more common worldwide. Having said that, Hi Tech devices are electrical energy power depended for control, data communication, and software etc. that are being used in agriculture greenhouses. 
Company Strategy
 The technology the Company is seeking to acquire combines hybrid solution for self-sufficient electric power with the traditional greenhouse’s sunlight energy, eliminating the need for electric infrastructure or air polluting generators.
 The Company intends to generate initial revenue by arranging for the sale, installation, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of solar systems in the commercial agriculture greenhouse market segment. We will be required to pay for the products and services needed to build and install these systems before their completion and before these systems will be able to produce electricity for the customer. The Company has not yet generated any revenues from these activities.
 
The Company’s strategy is to develop and continually increase sales by offering fundamentally unique solar power systems and to introduce a highly customizable and personalized approach to after-sales customer service through a unique type of contractual relationship with its customers.
 
We will endeavor to make the move to solar energy simple for our agriculture greenhouse customers by identifying and arranging quality installers and arranging the financing, permitting, installation and maintenance of our energy solutions. We intend to work with a group of contractors who permit, install, and interconnect a suitable solar energy solution to the utility grid, simplifying the installation of our agriculture greenhouse solar systems. Although we will engage third-parties for distribution and installation logistics, we will be the party who communicates with the customers throughout the entire period of services of our energy solutions.
 
During the next six months it is the Company’s plan to:
 

● | Raise capital to complete development of the Technology and to build an initial inventory of solar systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Initiate aggressive online and offline marketing campaigns to build our brand, market awareness, and recognition.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase sales via increased advertising and marketing campaigns.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hire additional key employees to help strengthen the Company.

The Technology 
 
The technology the Company is seeking to acquire involving the integration of photovoltaic cells into modular nylon sheets whereby the majority of the components are off the shelf, readily available, and “Combat Proven”. The unique aspect is in the design of the modular sheets. DASH B.S.T. Ltd is currently undergoing final review for the filing of a Patent in Israel. Once approved the company will seek the registration of the Israeli Patent in other domiciles. (Patent is undergoing final details). We have several ideas under development which will increase the whole efficiency each individual Greenhouse by higher levels of controls and automation. Installation of the solar energy systems is simple and can be done by applying the modular covering sheets on any greenhouse. The electrical connections are modular and can be made by a trained technician. An electrician is not required due to the components being low voltage. 
 
The hybrid solar energy technology will achieve multiple purposes with only one application.
 Saving costs in materials and labor
 Offers Dynamic adaption to the operator.
 Will allow remote sites away from a Grid to be “Highly Robotized”
 Our materials are more resistant to degradation when compared with others.
 The solar energy products are very competitive by using off the shelf components that represent very matured and reliable technologies. 
 The agriculture greenhouse operators will achieve multiple economic benefits.
 Description of Products and Services
 
The Company endeavors to provide solar energy solutions to underrepresented and/or growing agriculture greenhouse market segments that seek renewable energy solutions but don’t have direct access to them. We believe that our revenues will be derived directly from the sale, installation, and servicing of solar systems to our customers. The Company will not begin the installation of any solar facilities until it has obtained all necessary approvals for the installation of the system from local authorities and utility electricity providers. 
 
An interconnection agreement is generally required from the applicable local electricity utility to interconnect a solar energy system with the utility grid. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed. We would prepare and submit these agreements on behalf of our customers to ensure compliance with interconnection rules. 
 
Certain regulatory agencies have net metering requirements in place that provide a method of crediting customers who produce electricity on-site in excess of their own electricity consumption. In most situations, the utility will credit excess electricity generated from the solar system, although the compensation varies significantly depending on utilities or regulatory agency policies.
 
Hybrid solar energy technology uses a combination of solar energy used in the traditional way and photovoltaic energy cells woven into modular sheets made of elastic nylon. Traditional photovoltaic cells are normally not trans lucid, which does not allow sun light to pass through to whatever agriculture product is being grown in order to trigger the required Photosynthesis process. The technology the Company is seeking to acquire integrates photovoltaic cells into modular nylon sheets in such a way that allows translucency so that the sun light will pass through to the plants being grown and as a result there is no interference with a plant’s Photosynthesis process. The combination of producing both electricity while allowing continual plant growth will have an overall positive impact on both the greenhouse economics and productivity. 

10

The Company believes that the proprietary solar energy technology it is seeking to acquire is unique and creates a competitive first mover edge in that currently there does not appear to be available in the solar energy market segment a product that offers a lightweight, cost-effective means to produce electricity while not interfering with a plant’s Photosynthesis process. This hybrid solar energy solution will open the way for remote sites, away from the grid, will allow an effective path for low cost environmentally clean electric energy for more automated and therefore more cost-effective production of organic agriculture products.
 
In addition to sales, we expect to function as the project coordinator, arranging the financing, permitting, and installation of the system. We plan to purchase the solar systems utilizing our proprietary technology for from a qualified manufacturer, who will provide a warranty for the system equipment. Our contract installers who the company will train will specify the appropriate system components, and may perform the follow-up maintenance over the life of the solar system. Although we may eventually develop an in-house team of installers, we currently do not have such a team. 
 
Plan of Operation
 
Upon completion of the development of the solar energy technology the Company plans to continue to marketing its renewable energy generation systems, focusing on solar resources, as a replacement of fossil fuel energy generation equipment. In the next twelve months we intend to focus on finalizing the acquisition of a proprietary solar energy technology as well as completing the development of said technology, and develop and implement a marketing strategy for the sale distribution and installation of solar energy products for the agriculture greenhouse market segment. 
 
We currently lack the funding to complete the development of the solar energy technology. To effectively fund our business plan, we will need to raise additional capital in the form of equity, debt or a combination thereof. We have historically raised operating capital through the sale of our securities or debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient capital on terms acceptable to the Company to complete any or all of these projects.
 
During the 2nd quarter of 2022, we will require approximately $750,000 to complete the development of the solar energy technology, develop its marketing plan, and the general operating overhead of the Company. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise these funds or that it will be able to do so on terms that are favorable to the Company. 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2022, providing the Company has completed the development of the solar energy technology, the Company expects to commence the implementation of its marketing plan in order to achieve revenue generating operations. The Company anticipates it will be required to raise additional capital through the sale of its securities or debt in order to expand the sales, distribution and installation of its solar energy products for the agriculture greenhouse market. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise these funds or that it will be able to do so on terms that are favorable to the Company.
 
The amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose may vary significantly, and will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of the sale and installation of each solar energy system, conditions in the markets for the services required to complete solar energy systems, changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies, as well as any applicable legal or regulatory changes which may occur.
 
If we are unable to raise capital for the sale of our securities or other financing activities that we believe are needed to fund our business plan, we may be required to scale back our development plans by reducing expenditures for employees, consultants, business development and marketing efforts, and other envisioned expenditures. This could reduce our ability to complete existing solar energy system projects or initiate new ones, or require us to seek further funding earlier, or on less favorable terms, than if we had raised the full amount of the offering.
 
If management is unable to implement its proposed business plan or employ alternative financing strategies, it does not presently have any alternative proposals.

11


We cannot assure you that our solar energy systems will be completed in a timely manner or at all, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing, we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required to severely curtail, or even to cease our operations.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
At December 31, 2021, the Company had $0 of cash and negative working capital was ($359,698) as compared with $0 in cash and negative working capital of (460,841) at December 31, 2020 a decrease of ($101,143).
 
In 2021, funds used in operating activities included: expenditures for legal and professional fees. The Company needs to obtain capital; however, no assurance can be given that it will be able to obtain this capital on acceptable terms, if at all. In such an event, this may have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. If the need arises, the Company may attempt to obtain funding or pay expenses through the continued sale or issuance of restricted common or preferred stock. The Company may also use various types of short-term funding, related party advances and expenses payment deferrals and external loans. The Company’s auditors have issued a going concern opinion.
 
Management is actively exploring additional required funding through debt or equity financing pursuant to its plan. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations. Management believes that the results of the management plan, the Company’s existing resources and access to the capital markets will permit us to fund planned operations and expenditures. We believe that we will need to raise additional capital by way of equity, debt, debentures, or other methods, to support our anticipated operational expenses. Management is cautiously optimistic, however, that it will be able to generate the funding required to fund operations through the end of the year. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient capital on terms acceptable to the Company to complete any or all of these projects. 
 
Competition
 
Although many small and medium-sized companies are still in the process of understanding how solar energy can make sense for them, the Company believes that a large number of Fortune 500 companies have already received significant results by using solar power.
 
Nevertheless, we believe our primary competitors are the traditional local utilities that supply energy to our potential customers. We expect to compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems rather than fossil-based alternatives. We believe that our pricing and focus on customer relationships allow us to compete favorably with traditional utilities in the regions we intend to service.
 
Other sources of competition are other solar energy system providers such as Tesla, Inc., Vivint Solar Inc., Sunrun Inc., Sungevity, Inc., Tiger Reef, Inc., and many others. These companies may offer products that are similar to our solar energy systems, and we primarily expect to compete with these companies based on price. We believe that we will compete favorably with these companies. 
 
Potential direct competition to our products are the following technologies that are currently being developed: 
 
Poly-silicone, thin film materials are becoming available that allow light through. This material can be placed between two layers of glass or plastic and then used as the glazing on the greenhouse. As it reduces light transmission about 30 percent, only part of the roof is covered with the PV panels. MaineAsia LLC along with the Maine Sustainable Agriculture Society has a grant to build a couple of greenhouses with this technology.

12

Another company, Solaria Corporation in Fremont, Calif. has developed photovoltaic modules that alter the light spectrum by converting some of the sunlight to power with the rest remaining for plant growth. The pink light transmitted increases production while reducing disease problems.
 ULMA Agricola in Spain has developed greenhouse-mounted, optical lens-based PV modules that allow light through during cloudy weather and divert it to solar cells when it is sunny.
 One area that has just begun to be explored is making energy/shade screens into solar collectors. When a screen is extended to provide shade, it could provide a large area for collection.
 Currently being researched is a clear spray-on PV material that will generate electricity without much reduction in light transmission. 
 The Company anticipates that the following factors will give us a competitive advantage because we expect to become a technology company insulated by proprietary technology to competition and expect the customers to select the Company because:
 

● | We offer unique innovative products.
--+-------------------------------------


● | We intend to offer a flexible financing options and types of agreements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In regions where utility costs are high and/or incentives for solar energy systems are available, we intend to offer an attractive alternative to conventional power sources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development Costs
 
We expect to incur minimal research and development costs related to our new solar energy products in the future because all of the development costs are currently the responsibility of DASH B.S.T. Ltd from whom the company is seeking to acquire the solar energy technology.
Employees
 
The Company had one employee, its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Conquest. The Company also uses a part-time accounting consultant. Upon the intended completion of the acquisition of the solar energy technology the Company will seek to employ the following personnel: 
 
Electronic/Electric Engineer
 Agriculture Specialist.
 Energy Specialist
 Mechanical Engineer
 Logistic Manager
 Purchasing Agent
 3 General Skilled Workers
 General Manager
 Bookkeeper 
 Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company holds no patents, nor at this time, has any patent pending. DASH B.S.T. Ltd, the entity that the Company is currently seeking to acquire its proprietary solar energy technology, is currently undergoing final review for the filing of a Patent in Israel. Once approved the company will seek the registration of the Israeli Patent in other domiciles, particularly the United States.
 
13

The Company relies on a combination of trade secrets and contractual protections to establish and protect its intellectual proprietary rights. It may rely on patents held by its partners with whom the Company will have entered into a contractual relationship.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
An interconnection agreement is generally required from the applicable local electricity utility to interconnect a solar energy system with the utility grid. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection agreements are signed. We prepare and submit these agreements on behalf of our customers to ensure compliance with interconnection rules.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. We expend resources to comply with OSHA requirements and industry best practices. The prevailing wage is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification or type of work within a particular area. Prevailing wage requirements are established and enforced by regulatory agencies. Our in-house personnel monitors and coordinates our continuing compliance with these regulations when required.
 
Some jurisdictions place limits on the size or number of solar energy systems that can be interconnected to the utility grid. This can limit our ability to sell and install solar energy systems in some markets. The regulatory environment is constantly changing.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
The Company does not have any plans to manufacture the products it intends to market, sell and install. The manufacturers of these products may use, generate, and discharge toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes in its research and development, manufacturing, and construction activities. These companies will likely be subject to a variety of federal, state, and local governmental laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. In addition, these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the operations associated with our assets. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may in certain circumstances impose “strict liability,” rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. If these companies do not comply with these regulations and are unable to manufacture the products we intend to market and sell, we may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain replacement manufacturers and products which may be costly and may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Government Incentives and Policies
 
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives, and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, production-based incentives, tax abatements, and rebates. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage measures, including the installation and operation of residential and commercial solar energy systems.
 
Following the extension of the Solar Investment Tax Credit in December 2015, the Internal Revenue Code allows a United States taxpayer to claim a tax credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar energy system that is placed in service on or before December 31, 2019. This credit is scheduled to decline to 26% effective January 1, 2020, 22% in 2021, and then to 10% for commercial projects and 0% for residential projects in 2022.

14


Many U.S. states and local jurisdictions have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems, which include exemptions, exclusions, abatements, and credits. Many state governments, investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and co-operative utilities offer rebates or other cash incentives for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy-related products.
 
Many states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in excess of electric load used by customers.
 
Some states have established limits on net metering, fees on solar energy systems, or reduced the credit available for electricity generated by solar energy systems that are connected to the utility grid. For example, Hawaii, Nevada, and Mississippi have announced net metering policies that establish wholesale rates, not retail rates, for crediting electricity produced by solar energy systems. This has adversely impacted the attractiveness of solar energy to residential customers in these markets. The California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling that maintains the net energy metering credit at full retail value but adds new charges and requirements for customers installing a solar energy system. On the other hand, other states continue to expand their net metering programs. New York, for example, has suspended its cap on solar photovoltaic systems covered by the state’s net metering program.
 
Some states like Massachusetts have offered Solar Renewable Energy Credits (“SRECs”) that provide cash payments based on the electricity produced by solar energy systems as an incentive for customers to invest in these systems. These programs are generally capped and must be reauthorized or extended when the cap is reached in order for the incentives to be continued. The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources announced that the total capacity available under its most recent SREC program (SREC-II) for projects over 25 kW had been exceeded in early 2016, however it was announced on January 31, 2017, by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources that their new program, called Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (“SMART”), is targeted to start in April 2018 and that the SREC II program would be extended in order to bridge between the two programs. The SREC II program was ultimately extended until November 26, 2018, at which point the first applications for SMART were accepted. The first SMART incentive allocations began on January 15, 2019.
 
On January 22, 2018, the Office of the President of the United States approved in substantial form, recommendations by the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose a tariff of 30% on imports of solar cells and photovoltaic modules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, unless specifically excluded. The 30% tariff declines 5% per year over the four-year term of the tariff. Further, the provisions of the 201 Tariff are applicable to imported solar cells and modules from Canada, despite its being a member of the North American Free Trade Act.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operating results for solar energy system installations are difficult to predict and may, in the future, fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in state, federal, or private utility company subsidies, as well as weather, economic trends and other factors. The industry historically experienced seasonality in our solar installation business, with the first quarter representing our lowest installation quarter of the year, primarily due to adverse weather. Additionally, the industry historically experienced seasonality in sales of solar systems similar to ours, with the fourth and first quarters of the year seeing fewer sales orders than the second and third quarters. We do not have the historical experience to assess seasonality for this line of our own business.
