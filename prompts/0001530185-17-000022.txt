Item 1. Business
History and Organization
 
We were incorporated on December 27, 2010 as ATVROCKN, a Nevada corporation. On June 20, 2017, our corporate name was changed to Ameritek Ventures. We consider ourselves to be an emerging growth company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. (See “Implications of Being an ‘Emerging Growth Company’ ” below in this Section. Under our original business plan, it was our intention to market a "housing molding" product to place audio equipment and lighting on 4-wheel drive vehicles such as All Terrain Vehicles (“ATV”) and Utility Terrain Vehicles (“UTV”). We did not manufacturer any units as we utilized the services of a contract manufacturer to make the unit for us. We had no material agreement with our contract manufacturer other than we paid them to produce product for us based on our needs. As we were undercapitalized, we were unable to produce the required housing molding(s) we believe would best sell in the ATV/UTV aftermarket.
 
In August 2017, the Company completed its move into a new production and design facility in Roanoke, Virginia. On August 30, 2017, the Company acquired fiber optic assets from its largest shareholder and director. These assets will be used to fabricate and assemble machines incorporating its new PCVD (Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition) technology that is used in the manufacturing of specialty optical fiber preforms, which is the basis for specialized optical fiber production to satisfy a variety of fiber optic cable applications. In addition to building PCVD machines, the Company will be finalizing design work for its first 5 million km/year VAD/OVD (Vapor Axial Deposition/Outside Vapor Deposition) optical fiber preform production line, slated for assembly, testing and production in 2018. This process makes optical fiber preforms that are the mainstay for fiber optic cable that is used in the telecommunications industry to transmit large amounts of data to and from communication towers for the Internet, cable television and telephone industries. This new VAD/OVD production line represents the first phase of a planned 20 million km/year preform manufacturing facility. Ameritek Ventures’ brand new design and technology hub will help execute the Company's sustained growth and emergence strategy as a provider of high quality optical fiber preforms for the rapidly expanding Fiber Optic Cable worldwide market that in the past has been dominated by firms like Corning Incorporated, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd., Prysmian SpA, Jiangsu Fasten Co. Ltd and Fujikura Ltd.
 
Implications of Being an “Emerging Growth Company
 
As a public reporting company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:

· | are not required to obtain an attestation report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes); 
· | are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 
· | may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A; 
· | are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act; and 
· | are exempt from any PCAOB rules relating to mandatory audit firm rotation and any requirement to include an auditor discussion and analysis narrative in our audit report. 

 We intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under §107 of the JOBS Act.
 
Certain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Furthermore, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as we (1) have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter; or (2) for so long as we have a public float of zero, have annual revenues of less than $50 million during our most recently completed fiscal year.
 
Investors should be aware that we will be subject to the "Penny Stock" rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in Penny Stocks. These regulations may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for our stock, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.
