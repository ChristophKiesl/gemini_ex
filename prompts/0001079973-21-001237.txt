Filed Pending Patent Applications
 
A Cannaboside Composition and Method to Produce
 This patent application was filed on January 18, 2021 (U.S.P.T.O. #17/151,607) and is currently pending review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Company currently filed this patent application for international patent protection through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT/US2021/013830). The Patent Cooperation Treaty was ratified by the United States and 152 other countries which constitute the International Patent Cooperation Union for the cooperation in the filing, searching, and examination, of applications for the protection of inventions, and for rendering special technical services amongst the treaty members. The application is pending. This patent application seeks protection for a method to allow the easier mixing of cannabis into foods and beverages. Generally, cannabis extracts are oil-based and do not mix well with water-based foods and beverages. The technology invented by the company involves feeding oil-based cannabis extracts to insects. The insects then process the extracts through their bodies resulting in water-based compounds being excreted in the insect bodies. These newly created water-soluble compounds can then be harvested for use in foods, beverages, or pharmaceuticals. The patent claims coverage of both the process to create the compounds, and the use of the compounds in foodstuffs and pharmaceutical preparations.
Electrosprayed and Electrospun Cannabinoid Compositions and Process to Produce
 This patent application was filed on November 4, 2020 (U.S.P.T.O. #17/089,497 and is currently pending review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Company currently filed this patent application for international patent protection through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT/US2020/058937). The Patent Cooperation Treaty was ratified by the United States and 152 other countries which constitute the International Patent Cooperation Union for the cooperation in the filing, searching, and examination, of applications for the protection of inventions, and for rendering special technical services amongst the treaty members. The application is pending. The compositions invented by the company are nanoparticles and nanofibers made from cannabinoids. Nanoparticles and nanofibers are very small units of a substance. In the case of the technologies invented by the company, the units of cannabinoids created are in the areas between 100 nanometer and 700 nanometers wide. One nanometer is equal to one billionth of a meter. It is thought that cannabinoids of these sizes are more available to the human body and can be utilized in a host of different product applications to increase efficacy. An added feature of the invented technology is that the nanoparticles and nanofibers are based on all natural ingredients. This differs, in the company's opinion, significantly from other preparations that previously existed. Considering growing consumer taste for clean label products, the company believes natural compositions of cannabinoids will be highly preferred by consumers.
Cannabinoid Enriched Composition and Method of Using
 This patent application was filed on December 11, 2020 (U.S.P.T.O. 17/120,042) and is currently pending review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Company currently filed this patent application for international patent protection through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT/US2021/64683). The Patent Cooperation Treaty was ratified by the United States and 152 other countries which constitute the International Patent Cooperation Union for the cooperation in the filing, searching, and examination, of applications for the protection of inventions, and for rendering special technical services amongst the treaty members. The application is pending. This patent application was filed on December 11, 2020 (U.S.P.T.O. 17/120,042) and is currently pending review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Company currently filed this patent application for international patent protection through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT/US2021/64683). The Patent Cooperation Treaty was ratified by the United States and 152 other countries which constitute the International Patent Cooperation Union for the cooperation in the filing, searching, and examination, of applications for the protection of inventions, and for rendering special technical services amongst the treaty members. The application is pending. Specifically, the technology for which the company seeks protection are cannabinoids in the form of free-flowing powders that can be used in foods and beverages. The Company believes use of the technology could potentially significantly lower manufacturing costs for numerous manufacturers. Cannabinoids are typically sticky and unstable substances that are difficult to work with relative to the manufacturing of foods, beverages, and pharmaceutical products. The cannabinoid containing free-flowing powders invented by the company are significantly easier for manufacturers to utilize, thus potentially reducing manufacturing costs.

Polymeric Nanoparticles and Polymeric Nanofibers Research Program
 The Company has an active research and development program to develop novel polymeric nanoparticles and nanofibers of cannabinoids and hemp extracts. Polymeric nanoparticles are very small solid particles with a size in the range of 10–1000 nanometers (nm or billionth of a meter) and are made of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers or copolymers, in which cannabinoids or other active ingredients can be entrapped or encapsulated. Polymeric nanoparticles are noted for and have attractive characteristics, such as small size, near water solubility, high degrees of bioavailability, long shelf life and stability during storage. These properties are thought to be especially beneficial relative to delivery of cannabinoids and hemp extracts to the human body.
 Polymeric nanofibers are fibers with diameters several orders of magnitude smaller than conventional fibers, typically in the size range of a few nanometers to one micrometer. Due to their large surface areas per unit mass and extremely small pore size, these nanofibers demonstrate unique properties, making the technology especially well-suited to transdermal delivery of active ingredients, including cannabinoids.
 Project Varin
 The primary goal of Project Varin is the development of THC-V delivery methods that improve bioavailability of the cannabinoid to the human body. The project was recently expanded to include cannabinol (CBN) an additional rare cannabinoid.
 In the first stage of the program researchers produced THC-V polymeric nanoparticles and nanofibers based on the Company’s patent-pending technologies. In the second phase of development, the Company plans to apply its ongoing cannabinoid glycosides research to THC-V, in order to produce THC-V with unparalleled levels of availability at minimal usage levels.

As a result of Project Varin, the Company has developed several new methods to produce cannabinoid nanoparticles and nanofibers, which the Company plans to formulate into food and beverage ingredients for used in its own products or to be sold to other companies for inclusion in food, beverage, or other consumer goods. The Company plans to continue other areas of delivery systems research via Project Varin including its programs pertaining to cannabinoid glycosides, polymeric cannabinoid nanoparticles and nanofibers, and its hemp extract-based alcohol replacement technologies.
 
Edible, Dissolvable Film Enhanced with Solid Nanoparticles of Cannabinoids Research Program
 The Company is seeking to commercialize a unique invention of edible, disposable film enhanced with solid nanoparticles of cannabinoids under an agreement with Kirby & Padgett, LLC, a California limited liability company, entered into during June of 2019. Management believes there are numerous applications for such a product, such as a container for ready-made foods, protein powders, vitamins, and nutraceuticals that can be simply dropped into cold beverages, thus allowing the consumer to avoid additional steps of mixing ingredients. Additionally, since the film is impregnated with what is believed to be highly bioavailable cannabinoids, the film will perhaps serve a dual purpose as a delivery vehicle for cannabinoids to the body. Future versions of the film could include ingredients such as vitamins, trace minerals or active pharmaceutical ingredients. On June 6, 2019, the Company entered into a joint intellectual property ownership and consulting agreement with Kirby & Padgett, LLC, a California Limited liability company in order to more fully develop and to commercialize the invention. Any intellectual property developed under the collaboration effort will be considered joint property with all rights, title and interest assigned jointly to the Company and Kirby. Each Party shall work with the other Party relative to all business and monetization of such new Joint Intellectual Property and neither Party shall have any preferred rights over the other. Additionally, either party shall have the right to market the new invention with any and all revenues, costs, and profits to be shared on a fifty percent/fifty percent (50%/50%) shares by the parties. All expenses will be agreed to in advance, with each Party sharing based on predetermined percentages of such expenses.
Industry Overview
 Industrial Hemp
 Industrial Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) has been cultivated by humans for thousands of years. Hemp was originally cultivated as a source of fibers with most of this early cultivation occurring in temperate climates, thus most genotypes had very low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content. Hemp was introduced into North America in the early part of the 17th century, and it played an important part in early American agriculture throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, with cultivation in virtually every one of the original American colonies.

Hemp seed oil became an important industrial input that was used in inks, paints, varnishes, and many other products. The proliferation of cotton cultivation and the significant profitability of tobacco cultivation in the mid-1800s led to a sharp decline in hemp production. From the mid 1800s through the pre-World War II period, hemp cultivation continued at relatively low levels. During World War II, hemp production increased to meet the military needs for fibers to support various industrial production.
 The early 1930’s was a period when higher THC strains of cannabis native to southeast Asia were introduced to North America and Western Europe and as a result, psychoactive strains became associated with very low THC containing industrial strains that were being cultivated in North America. This resulted in efforts to prohibit the cultivation and possession of Cannabis sativa L. in the United States.
 Since 1937, Cannabis sativa L. has been a federally regulated Schedule I illegal drug under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 811 (the “CSA”), regulated by the Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”).
 It was not until 2014 when a distinction between the use of Cannabis sativa L. for medical, recreational, and industrial purposes was made via Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014, which cleared a legal path for industrial hemp to be grown in three limited circumstances, 1) by researchers at an institute of higher education, 2) by state departments of agriculture, or 3) by farmers participating in a research program permitted and overseen by a state department of agriculture.
 In 2016 the DEA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the FDA issued a joint statement detailing the guidelines for growth of industrial hemp as part of state-sanctioned research programs. Those guidelines state that hemp can only be sold in states with pilot programs, plants and seeds can only cross state lines as part of permitted state research programs, and seeds can only be imported by individuals registered with the DEA.
 We believe the recent passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will allow the Company to expand its marketplace opportunities. On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp-derived CBD were classified as a Schedule I controlled substances, and so illegal under the CSA. With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under federal law and would thus face no legal protection under this new legislation and would be an illegal Schedule 1 drug under the CSA.
 Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.

The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3% THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 The FDA regulates product manufacturing and labeling under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Products containing CBD are not included in the definition of a dietary supplement under the Act. FDA is currently evaluating the regulatory frameworks that apply to certain cannabis and hemp-derived products that are intended for non-drug uses, including whether any new FDA regulations may be warranted (see below).
 Psychoactive Cannabis
 A total of 35 states, District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands have approved some form of cannabis legalization or decriminalization. These laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal CSA, which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision.
 Medical cannabis decriminalization is generally referred to as the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and use of cannabis by adults, including cultivation for personal use and casual, nonprofit transfers of small amounts. Legalization is generally referred to as the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis, where consumers purchase from a safe, legal, and regulated source.
 The dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury have issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, as banks can still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, there is widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 In November 2016, California approved marijuana use for adults over the age of 21 without a physician’s prescription or recommendation, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. Despite the changes in state laws, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
 In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“the AUMA”), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process, and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA.

The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.
 We are monitoring the Biden administration’s, the DOJ’s and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Since the start of the new Congress in January 2021, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Government’s approach to cannabis. The DOJ has not signaled any change in their enforcement efforts. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
 Although the possession, cultivation, and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in California, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with all state and local laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state, or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 FDA Regulation of Hemp Extracts
 The United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) is generally responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of (1) prescription and over the counter drugs; (2) biologics including vaccines, blood & blood products, and cellular and gene therapies; (3) foodstuffs including dietary supplements, bottled water, and baby formula; and, (4) medical devices including heart pacemakers, surgical implants, prosthetics, and dental devices.
 Regarding its regulation of drugs, the FDA process requires a review that begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND) application, with follow on clinical studies and clinical trials that the FDA uses to determine whether a drug is safe and effective, and therefore subject to approval for human use by the FDA.
 Aside from the FDA’s mandate to regulate drugs, the FDA also regulates dietary supplement products and dietary ingredients under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. This law prohibits manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients from marketing products that are adulterated or misbranded. This means that these firms are responsible for evaluating the safety and labeling of their products before marketing to ensure that they meet all the requirements of the law and FDA regulations, including, but not limited to the following labeling requirements: (1) identifying the supplement; (2) nutrition labeling; (3) ingredient labeling; (4) claims; and, (5) daily use information.
 The FDA has not approved cannabis, marijuana, hemp, or derivatives as a safe and effective drug for any indication. As of the date of this filing, we have not, and do not intend to file an IND with the FDA, concerning any of our products that contain CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis to be delivered in the State of California. Further, our products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp are not marketed or sold using claims that their use is safe and effective treatment for any medical condition subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction.

The FDA has concluded that products containing cannabis or industrial hemp derived CBD are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, respectively. The FDA’s position is that products containing cannabis, CBD or derivatives are Schedule 1 drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, and so are illegal. Our products containing CBD derived from industrial hemp or cannabis delivered in the State of California are not marketed or sold as dietary supplements. However, at some indeterminate future time, the FDA may choose to change its position concerning generally cannabis and products containing hemp derived CBD and may choose to enact regulations that are applicable to such products. In this event, our industrial hemp-based products containing CBD and cannabis may be subject to regulation.
 Effective on July 1, 2019, the Company acquired Action Nutraceuticals, Inc., a California Corporation (“Action Nutraceuticals”) and its assets from our CEO, Arman Tabatabaei, in exchange for $1,000 (see “Related Party Transactions”). Action Nutraceuticals is a developmental stage company engaged in research and development relating to powdered soft drink, coffee, and tea mixes containing non-psychoactive CBD. No intellectual property, patents or trademarks were acquired in the transaction.
 The Company’s research and development efforts will center on methodologies to infuse hemp extracts, CBD, and other cannabinoids into highly bioavailable powders to be used in the Company’s products or sold to other manufacturers. The Company plans to utilize its internally developed infusion technologies, technical knowhow and equipment acquired from Action Nutraceuticals to develop, manufacture and sell consumer-oriented powdered drink mixes that include industrial hemp derived, non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient. All products sold are being specifically developed with a composition containing less than three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) of THC concentration by dry weight. As of the date of this filing, our Hemp You Can Feel Product research and development operations are suspended pending regulatory guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We intend to restart our research and development if and when the FDA issues regulatory guidance on the use of hemp and hemp-based CBD.
 The Drug Enforcement Administration has issued a rule regarding the scheduling of hemp and marijuana manufactured cannabinoids
 The ruling creates uncertainty relating to the regulatory status of the manufactured cannabinoids we are researching and developing. Should the DEA conclude that manufactured cannabinoids are regulated under the CSA, we might not be able to continue to our plans to continue the research and development of possible products based on manufactured cannabinoids. This could affect our business opportunities in the future.
 The Rule states there are only four conforming changes, The rule reiterates these changes outlined below were already mandated under the 2018 Farm Bill: “DEA’s regulatory authority over any plant with less than 0.3% THC content on a dry weight basis, and any of the plant’s derivatives under the 0.3% THC content limit, is removed as a result.”
 
1. | The definition of “Tetrahydrocannabinols” on Schedule I of the official “Schedule of Controlled Substances” is modified to carve out “any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that falls within the definition of hemp” (as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, i.e., any plant with less than 0.3% THC content on a dry weight basis, and any of the plant’s derivatives under the 0.3% THC).

Sales and Marketing
 The Company recently began sales and marketing activities for its products and inventions. The Company primarily plans to market its non-psychoactive products via a “white label” strategy where the company produces products marketed and sold by other companies. The Company also plans to market its products directly to consumers.
 Please reference the section labeled “Risk Factors to our Business” for additional information.
 Significant Customers
 The company has no significant customers.
 Competition
 We are entering markets that are highly competitive.
 Relative to our prospects for commercializing polymeric nanoparticles and nanofibers, there are many competitors with various approaches to cannabinoid infusion for foods, beverages and other consumer products. While these currently available technologies are not directly competitive with us, such technologies may be viewed as being directly competitive by the marketplace in the future. Many of the current market participants are well established with considerable financial backing. We expect the quality and composition of the competitive market in the hemp processing environment to continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new states and geographies enter into the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate cannabis and hemp products, including the 2018 Farm Bill. We believe the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our expected operations and results relating to our hemp processing businesses.
Employees
 
The Company has one employee, CEO, Arman Tabatabaei. Additionally, the Company relies on the services of numerous consultants who perform various tasks for the Company. Our U.S employee is not represented by a labor union.
