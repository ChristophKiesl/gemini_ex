ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are a medical technology company primarily focused on the design, development and commercialization of innovative medical devices to advance gastrointestinal therapeutic endoscopy.
Our Endoscopy product portfolio consists of the OverStitchTM Endoscopic Suturing System, X-TackTM Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System and Orbera® Intragastric Balloon.
Our products are used by gastroenterologists and bariatric surgeons in a variety of settings to treat multiple gastrointestinal ("GI") conditions including closure of acute perforations and chronic fistulas; tissue closure after the removal of abnormal lesions in the esophagus, stomach or colon (also known as endoscopic submucosal dissections, endoscopic mucosal resections and endoscopic full thickness resections); the treatment of swallowing disorders (peroral endoscopic myotomy, or "POEM"); esophageal stent fixation and obesity.
Corporate Background
Apollo was founded in 2005 and is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in Austin, Texas. The Company was founded to develop and commercialize innovations originating from a collaboration of physicians from the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, Medical University of South Carolina, the University of Texas Medical Branch and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who called themselves the Apollo Group. The work of the Apollo Group resulted in a significant portfolio of patents in the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery aimed at minimizing the trauma of surgical access by taking advantage of natural orifices to deliver surgical tools to targeted areas.
In December 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the obesity intervention division of Allergan, Inc. The assets acquired were the Lap-Band® System and related laparoscopic surgery accessories (the Surgical product line) and the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System. In conjunction with this purchase agreement, we entered into several agreements whereby Allergan agreed to provide manufacturing and distribution support over a two-year period as we established our own capabilities. 
In December 2016, we completed a business combination (the "Merger") with Lpath, Inc. ("Lpath"), a publicly traded company. Following the Merger, Lpath was renamed "Apollo Endosurgery, Inc." and our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "APEN." 
In December 2018, Apollo entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement") with ReShape Lifesciences, Inc. ("ReShape") pursuant to which, among other things, ReShape acquired from Apollo substantially all of our assets exclusively related to the Surgical product line, which consisted of the Lap-Band® System and related laparoscopic accessories for $10.0 million in cash and future cash consideration of $7.0 million. As additional consideration, we also received from ReShape substantially all of their assets exclusively related to their intragastric balloon product line. On December 31, 2018, we ceased sales of ReShape's intragastric balloon product and have since withdrawn its premarket approval ("PMA").

Overview of the Market
Our Endoscopy products are designed to treat a variety of gastrointestinal conditions including closure of gastrointestinal defects, managing gastrointestinal complications and the treatment of obesity.
Interventional and therapeutic gastroenterology is a high growth area within medicine and our suturing products are used in both the upper and lower GI tract. Examples of upper GI applications include fistula closure, esophageal stent fixation, and tunnel closure for POEM. Fistulas are chronic or acute defects that can form between two sites in the GI tract, cavity or skin, often occurring as a result of abdominal surgery. Esophageal stents are often used as part of the treatment of esophageal blockage from cancers or benign scarring and fixation is designed to prevent the premature migration of the stent, especially in benign conditions, which is common and costly. Clinical evidence shows that esophageal stents that are not fixed in place will have as high as a 60% migration rate. Suturing stents in place helps reduce stent migration, saving an average of $860 per patient by preventing repeat procedures and complications for the patient. Achalasia is a condition where a patient has difficulty swallowing. As the incidence of achalasia increases, there is growing interest in endoscopic treatment options that can be offered, such as the POEM procedure. Suturing of the tunnel following the esophageal muscle dissection and release during a POEM secures a quick and low profile solution for the patient.
In the lower GI tract, there are over 20 million colonoscopies performed annually in the United States alone. Cancer screening followed by the endoscopic resection of complex flat and large polyps can provide patients with an alternative to surgical resections. Delayed bleeding is a general risk of endoscopic resection and patients over the age of 50 are more often on anti-thrombotic (blood thinning) medications which carry a higher risk of bleeding. Suturing the resection site aids in healing and helps prevent delayed bleeding following the procedure.
Obesity as a disease is increasing worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated that 93 million adults are obese or clinically obese with a body mass index ("BMI") of 30 or more. Worldwide, over 650 million people are considered obese. Traditional obesity intervention has been bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and gastric banding), which is mostly performed laparoscopically. Today, based on U.S. population demographics and physician society reported bariatric procedure volumes, less than 1% of the population eligible for bariatric surgery elect to have a procedure each year. Based on published surveys, the eligible patient's primary detraction from bariatric surgery is fear of surgery in general, but more specifically fear associated with the invasive nature of bariatric surgery, permanent anatomical alteration, potential for non-permanent results and the post-operative severe complications that have been reported with bariatric surgery.
Apollo's Strategy
Our objective is to provide products that advance endoscopic solutions for a wide range of patient needs ranging from gastrointestinal defect and stent management to the treatment of obesity. Our "Endoscopy" products allow these solutions to be delivered endolumenally by an endoscopist using a flexible endoscope, thus providing patients with treatment options that remove or defer the need for traditional surgery.
The key elements of our strategy include:
•Support the adoption of our Endoscopy products - We accomplish this today through our medical education activities, field sales support, and clinical investments that support product adoption and use. Our most important clinical study currently is the Multi-center ESG Randomized Intervention Trial ("MERIT") study, which is expected to support future payor reimbursement decision-making for the endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty procedure for obesity.
•Continue to deliver innovative products and broaden the product portfolio - In December 2020, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System. The X-Tack system expands the use of our suturing technology to a larger population of gastrointestinal procedures in the lower GI tract. In late 2018, we also introduced the OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System which enabled our full thickness suturing technology to be used with multiple manufacturers' single-channel flexible endoscopes, representing the majority of flexible endoscopes in use today. We intend to continue to broaden our portfolio of products through internal product development efforts and will consider acquisitions that complement our current business.
•Expand into new markets -We intend to continue to pursue regulatory clearance for our products in key international markets where we believe there is strong market demand for our products.
Apollo Products
Endoscopy
The Apollo Endoscopy products consist primarily of the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System, X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System and the Intragastric Balloon System (most often branded as Orbera). For the year ended December 31, 2020, 64% of our total Endoscopy sales related to the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System and 36% related to the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System products. We received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for X-Tack in December 2020. 
OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System
The OverStitch and OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System ("ESS", "OverStitch", or "Sx") enables advanced endoscopic procedures from within the GI tract, or endolumenally, by allowing physicians to suture, especially full-thickness, and secure the approximation of tissue. OverStitch and OverStitch Sx are currently the only U.S. cleared flexible endoscopic suturing devices capable of full-thickness suturing of tissue. OverStitch is a single-use suturing device that is attached to a flexible endoscope. The flexible endoscope, with the OverStitch device attached, allows a physician to access a patient's upper and lower GI tract and accurately suture the tissue inside the GI tract for different clinical needs, including a range of defect repairs, esophageal stent fixation to prevent stent migration, and volumetric space reduction. The OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System received FDA 510(k) clearance in August 2008 and CE Mark in November 2012. The OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System received FDA 510(k) clearance in June 2018 and CE Mark in November 2018.
The OverStitch device that was 510(k) cleared in August of 2008 is compatible with a specific dual channel flexible endoscope that has limited market presence, representing less than five percent of the flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world. Beginning in November 2018, we began the first commercial shipments of the OverStitch Sx that is compatible with four major scope manufacturers and over 20 single-channel flexible endoscopes with diameters ranging from 8.8 mm to 9.8 mm. These Sx compatible single-channel endoscopes represent the majority of flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world today.
Since its market introduction in 2008, over 60,000 OverStitch units have been sold for procedures worldwide.
We estimate that the majority of OverStitch uses, approximately 60%, were for bariatric procedures, the endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty and the revision of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy anatomies to reintroduce weight loss. The other uses were for non-bariatric procedures, closure of various defects in the upper and lower GI tract and the fixation of stents in the esophagus. 
One of the most promising newly developed weight-loss procedures is commonly referred to as endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty ("ESG"), which transorally uses endoscopic suturing with OverStitch to reduce the volume of the stomach and remodel the stomach into a small diameter sleeve; similar to the goal of a surgical sleeve gastrectomy procedure but without the invasiveness and need for amputation of a significant portion of the patient's stomach. The advantages of the ESG as compared to a surgical sleeve gastrectomy include keeping the original structural and functional integrity of the stomach, lower procedure adverse events, reversibility, relative ease of revision or maintenance, reduced recovery time, avoidance of surgical incisions, and reduced costs.
ESG is based on the placement of full-thickness sutures to secure the approximation of tissue which is the labeled indication of OverStitch. However, the labeled indication of the OverStitch device does not include a claim for weight-loss. The first ESG multi-center study was presented in May 2016 at Digestive Disease Week which was later updated as a 24-month follow-up study that was published in April 2017 in Obesity Surgery, the Journal of Metabolic Surgery and Allied Care. 
Subsequently, there have been numerous published investigator-initiated ESG studies conducted by a variety of physicians around the world. In 2019, four separate meta-analyses were published that pooled the results from eight published ESG studies involving more than 1,700 patients. These four meta-analyses demonstrated between 15% to 20% total body weight loss measured at periods between 6 to 24 months and low adverse event rates.
In 2017, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota to undertake the MERIT trial to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ESG compared to efficacy endpoints set forth in a consensus statement of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ("ASGE") and the American Society of Metabolic Bariatric Surgery ("ASMBS") and its impact on obesity related comorbidities in patients with obesity and BMI range of 30 to 45.
The MERIT-Trial was designed to enroll two hundred patients, stratified into three groups (Obesity, Obesity with hypertension, Obesity with diabetes). The trial has two levels: (1) the randomized study phase with primary outcomes for both treatment and control participants evaluated at twelve months, and (2) the crossover, non-randomized study phase with outcomes for (a) the initial treatment participants at 24 months after their ESG, and (b) the control cross-over participants evaluated at twelve months after their ESG. The MERIT trial subsequently received an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA in 2019. The primary outcomes for the first level procedures of the study are measured after a one-year follow-up period. The final enrolled patient completed their 12-month follow-up during the fourth quarter of 2020. Primary outcomes data is expected in mid-2021. Crossover patients and first level procedure recipients will continue to be followed through 2021 to measure the study's secondary outcomes. Final secondary outcomes data is expected to be available in the first half of 2022. 
During 2017, we entered into a Registry Funding Agreement with the American Gastroenterological Association ("AGA") Center for GI Innovation and Technology to develop and administer a registry (the “AGA Registry”) to collect real-world evidence related to the safety and efficacy of a number of flexible endoscopic suturing-enabled procedures, including the revision of gastric bypass (known as an outlet revision) who have experienced weight regain after their initial bariatric surgery; the fixation of esophageal stents to prevent migration; and other suturing procedures currently in practice. The resulting data will be used to present the benefits of endoscopic suturing procedures relative to traditional therapies. Enrollment for the endoscopic revision of a gastric bypass procedure has concluded and the follow up will continue into the fourth quarter of 2021. Data from other endoscopic suturing procedures which have been collected in the registry has been analyzed and submitted to SAGES 2021 and DDW 2021. 
During 2018, we established a European multi-center, longitudinal data repository for ESG and outlet revision procedures. This registry will collect outcomes across participating European centers related to procedure safety and effectiveness. In addition, a second, multi-center, retrospective data repository for gastrointestinal applications performed using the OverStitch System was also created. The objective of this registry is to collect European demographic, procedural and outcome data when OverStitch is used during various non-bariatric procedures including closure of full thickness and mucosal defects, post-operative leaks, perforations, stent fixation, treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding and other procedures. The goal is to support the clinical use and benefits of endolumenal suturing as well as provide real-world data on safety and effectiveness which can support physicians, patients and payors in making informed decisions. Both registries are expected to provide interim reporting.
Additional applications for endoscopic suturing are emerging as physicians gain suturing proficiency and identify additional patient needs. In June 2018, Endoscopy International published for example a study of a novel resection and plication anti-reflux procedure ("RAP") using OverStitch. In this patient series, RAP was performed on 10 patients with gastroesophageal reflex disease ("GERD") and on long-term proton pump inhibitor ("PPI") therapy. All the patients underwent RAP without adverse events and were discharged on the same day. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 24 months, with the median being 9 months, and all patients were reported as having significant improvement in their GERD based quality of life scores, and 8 of the 10 patients had eliminated their daily PPI use.
X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System
The X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System (“X-Tack”) is a novel, through-the-scope, suture-based device designed specifically for closing and healing defects in the lower gastrointestinal tract. It is expected also to have application in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The X-Tack device enables physicians to easily address the challenges commonly encountered when closing large or irregularly shaped defects. The procedure involves suture-tethered HeliX Tacks, independently positioned into healthy tissue adjacent to a defect, then cinched to close the construct. X-Tack fulfills a long-expressed need for advanced closure devices to improve healing and address potential adverse events that can occur following standard colonic polypectomy 
and endoscopic mucosal resection of complex polyps, such as delayed bleeding or perforation. X-Tack received FDA clearance on December 15, 2020 and the first clinical cases were successfully completed in January 2021.
The endoscopic removal of upper gastrointestinal and colorectal neoplasia has a 2% risk of perforation and 8% risk of delayed bleeding. These two serious adverse events often result in additional endoscopic as well as surgical interventions, hospitalizations, expanded health care costs, and significant distress for both patients and their physicians. The closure of resection sites has been reported to significantly reduce the incidence of these two adverse events and has generated growing advocacy among physician societies. 
Today, closure of polyp resection sites can be accomplished by applying through-the-scope (TTS) metallic (hemostatic) clips, over-the-scope (OTSC) large metallic clips or suturing with our OverStitch device. However, clips have limited use for large or irregular shaped defects while suturing requires use of a gastroscope, limiting access to the full length of the colon and also requires removal of the scope from the patient in order to mount the suturing device. 
The X-Tack closure device is intended to resolve the limitations of TTS clips, OTSC and endoscopic suturing by offering functionality through the working channel of any standard gastroscope or colonoscope with precise HeliX Tack placement and tight closure of sites of varying shapes and sizes.
Each X-Tack device enables physicians to place up to four individual HeliX Tacks into healthy tissue adjacent to a defect using a novel Persian drill handle. The HeliX Tack design includes barbs on the coil for enhanced tack fixation.
Each HeliX Tack has an eyelet tethering it to a suture. Pulling tension on the suture approximates the HeliX Tacks and, in turn, closes the tissue defect. A suture cinch is then used as the final step to secure the suture in place. Because it offers multiple points of fixation, we believe the X-Tack enhances a physician’s ability to overcome challenges of closing large or irregularly shaped defects. 
Orbera Intragastric Balloon System
The intragastric balloon system ("IGB", the "Orbera System" or "Orbera") is currently marketed under three brands depending on geography: the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System, the BIB, and the Orbera365 Managed Weight Loss System ("Orbera365"). Our IGB is a non-surgical alternative for interventional weight loss. Orbera is the global market leader among intragastric balloons and is available in over 75 countries and more than 300,000 units have been sold worldwide. Our IGB is a single silicone balloon that is filled with saline after its endoscopic placement into the patient's stomach. Once in the patient's stomach, the balloon serves to reduce stomach capacity, causing patients to consume less following the procedure, and delay gastric content emptying which assists the patient in losing weight. Placement of the balloon is temporary and at the end of its indwell time it is removed endoscopically, typically, under conscious sedation.
Outside the U.S., the BIB was CE marked in May 1997 and the Orbera365 was CE marked in August 2017. In the U.S., Orbera was approved by the FDA in August 2015. 
In the U.S., Orbera is indicated for an indwell period of up to six months for adults within a BMI range of 30 to 40 who have tried other weight loss programs, such as supervised diet and exercise, but who were unable to lose weight and keep it off. Outside the U.S., Orbera is generally indicated for patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 27, and depending on the specific product label, is indicated for an indwell time of six or twelve months. In some cases, generally higher BMI patients, Orbera is indicated for use prior to general surgery in order to lose weight, reduce their surgical risk and improve recovery time.
Today, IGBs are frequently used for aesthetic weight loss purposes and because of this, the IGB procedure is typically not covered by insurance and is paid for directly by the patient. While aesthetics is a significant market today for Orbera; we believe that IGB use for medical purposes is a potentially larger opportunity.
Specific to Orbera, there is a substantial and increasing body of evidence that shows that the level of weight loss with Orbera is very effective in the treatment of comorbidities associated with obesity. The clinical effectiveness and safety profile of the Orbera System as a non-ulcerogenic weight loss device has been reported in over 250 peer reviewed publications. Although not specifically indicated for the treatment of any individual obesity-related comorbidities, studies have consistently reported resolution or improvement in a patient's pre-existing comorbidities at the time of Orbera removal. Orbera is currently the only balloon or other endoscopic product that has been recognized in the ASGE Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations assessment to have met its threshold standards for the treatment of obesity. The meta-analysis performed by the ASGE was based on the aggregation of certain clinical studies conducted outside the U.S. and reported an estimated TBWL at six months of approximately 13.2%.
In the January 2021 Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Journal, physicians from Mayo Clinic presented on their prospective open-label FDA-approved study of Orbera patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ("NASH"). Of the patients treated, 65% achieved resolution of NASH on biopsy; 80% had at least a two point improvement in their non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease activity score; and 15% had tissue evidence indicating regression of fibrosis (liver scarring). NASH is expected to become the most common cause of liver cirrhosis by 2030, leading to increased risk of liver-related death and higher rates of malignancy.
Our development strategy is to further establish the medical relevancy of Orbera in areas of unmet medical need such as fatty liver disease and increase clinician awareness.
As part of the FDA approval of Orbera, we were required to conduct a post-approval clinical study. The Orbera Post-Approval Study (PAS) was a prospective, multi-center, open-label study of the safety and effectiveness of Orbera as an adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older) with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2. The Orbera PAS completed enrollment in September 2018 with 281 patients treated with Orbera from 11 U.S. clinical study sites. The study's primary endpoint was a serious adverse event rate of less than 15% and secondary endpoint was total body weight loss of at least 7.5% at the time of Orbera's removal. All study endpoints were met and our PAS obligation is complete. 
As part of the CE mark approval for Orbera 365, we committed to perform a post-approval clinical study. The Orbera 365 CE post approval study will enroll 100 patients at four to five centers in different European countries who will be followed for 24 months. The start of this study was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the first clinical site began enrollment in February 2021.
In February 2017, the FDA issued a letter to health care providers related to adverse events following placement of liquid-filled balloons which were not seen during the U.S. pivotal studies, specifically related to events of spontaneous balloon over-inflation and, separately, reports of acute pancreatitis. We subsequently developed updates to Orbera's product labeling and physician training materials, and these were approved by FDA and implemented in June 2017. The labeling changes included additions to the “Warnings” and “Possible Complications” sections and an update to the “Clinical Evaluations…” sub-section within the “Adverse Events” history for Orbera.
In August 2017, the FDA issued a second update to alert health care providers of five reports of unanticipated deaths that occurred since 2016 in patients with a liquid-filled intragastric balloon implant. Four of the deaths involved patients who had received an Orbera and had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process. Following this letter, we interactively worked with the FDA to provide further updates regarding the risks of gastric and esophageal perforation, aspiration, and death and updated the label disclosure for these adverse events as well as the physician training material to provide more detailed descriptions of the patient symptoms that may indicate persistent (or refractory) intolerance, methods of assessing these patients, and recommendations for the management of symptoms and removal of the device.
In June 2018, the FDA approved new Orbera labeling and concurrent with their approval issued a third update to alert health care providers of the label updates and provide an update on new reports worldwide of unanticipated deaths that had been reported since their August 2017 letter to Health Care Providers. Four of the reported deaths in this third update involved patients who had received our IGB product. In each case, the occurrence had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process. In the period from January 1, 2008 through March 30, 2020, there were 31 reported deaths of patients while they had an Orbera which is an incident rate of less than 0.02% based on the more than 165,000 Orbera balloons distributed during that same time period. 
In April 2020, the FDA issued a fourth update to healthcare providers upon the successful completion of the Orbera PAS. The FDA advised physicians to consider the PAS results and emphasized that patients should be instructed to recognize the symptoms of potentially life-threatening conditions. 
In the U.S., we also offer Apollo Care, a professional nutritionist support service for Orbera patients and non-Orbera patients who are trying to lose weight.
Surgical
In December 2018, Apollo entered into an agreement with ReShape to divest its Surgical product line. As part of the agreement Apollo and ReShape entered into a set of transition services agreements under which Apollo continued to distribute the products in markets outside the U.S. for up to 12 months and continued to manufacture the Surgical product line for up to two years. As of December 31, 2020, Apollo's transition, distribution and manufacturing obligations are complete. 
Competition
We are the only manufacturer with a cleared device for full thickness endoscopic suturing currently on the market in the U.S. or outside the U.S. Competing technologies for closure during certain GI applications are offered by large and established manufacturers in the GI space including Boston Scientific Corporation, Olympus Medical, Steris (US Endoscopy) and Cook Medical. Outside the U.S., there are a variety of local and regional competitive intragastric balloon manufacturers including SC MedSil, Medicone, Allurion Technologies and Spatz Laboratories. In the U.S., there is one other manufacturer with an intragastric balloon approved by the FDA at this time, Obalon Therapeutics, Inc.
We face competition from other interventional therapies for the treatment of obesity. These other therapies are primarily surgical in nature, such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy is a surgical weight-loss procedure in which the stomach is reduced to about 15% of its original size by the longitudinal resection and removal of a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature. The result is a sleeve or tube-like structure. The procedure permanently alters the stomach although weight regain after a few years is common. Gastric bypass surgery refers to a surgical procedure in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch excluding the much larger lower residual stomach and then the small intestine is rerouted to connect to the small upper pouch. The procedure leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food. Both procedures are normally performed laparoscopically and rely upon surgical staplers as their principal surgical tool. As a result, these procedures are supported by the suppliers of surgical staplers, the largest of whom are Johnson & Johnson (Ethicon) and Medtronic (Covidien). Both companies have substantially more resources and ability to influence physicians and policy makers than we do.
Sales and Distribution
We currently market and sell our products principally to providers of medical services and procedures including hospitals, outpatient surgical centers, clinics and physicians through an employee sales force in the U.S., Australia and certain countries in Europe. In addition, we sell products to third party distributors in certain markets where we have regulatory clearance for our products but do not have employees. In total, our products are offered in over 75 countries.
Obesity procedures that utilize our Endoscopy products are often cash pay procedures which means the patient must pay for the procedures out of pocket, although there are exceptions. Revisions of prior bariatric surgery using endoscopic suturing are routinely receiving reimbursement from select payors for patients treated at specific hospitals in the U.S. Some of these same hospitals have also established relationships with select payors for the reimbursement of ESG procedures. Other times, reimbursement occurs on a case-by-case basis following a review of the patient's specific situation. Medical procedures that utilize endoscopic suturing products in the treatment of GI complications generally receive reimbursement, but coverage can vary by country, state and procedure performed. IGB treatment is reimbursed in some countries for patients who meet certain criteria. 
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We operate a manufacturing facility in the Coyol Free Trade Zone in Alajuela, Costa Rica that performs assembly of select components of the OverStitch system, and final assembly of our new X-Tack System and IGB products. We also have the ability to manufacture select product components and sub-assemblies at our engineering facility in Austin, Texas. We manage all aspects of product supply through our operations team based in Austin, Texas and in our Costa Rica facility. In addition, we rely on several third-party suppliers to provide other OverStitch system components. We have identified several gross margin improvement projects intended to lower our product costs and improve capacity utilization of our manufacturing facility over the next three years.
We believe that our existing manufacturing facilities give us the necessary physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of products to meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months. Our manufacturing facility is certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and operates under the FDA's good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices set forth in the Quality System Regulation, ("QSR").
During 2020, we completed our obligation to manufacture the LapBand product pursuant to the terms of the December 2018 sale of our Surgical product line.
Intellectual Property
We have developed and acquired significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality agreements and contracts. However, these methods afford only limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technology, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval.
We protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.
As of December 31, 2020, we own over 105 U.S. patents and 165 foreign patents. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2037 and our foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2034 subject to the payment of the requisite renewal fees. We also own 20 pending U.S. patent applications and 18 pending foreign patent applications. We believe patents will be issued pursuant to such applications but cannot guarantee it. Moreover, neither the timing of any issuance, the scope of protection, nor the actual issue date of these pending applications can be forecasted with precision. Where we have acquired or licensed patent rights from third parties, we are generally required to pay royalties. While our patents are an important element of our products and future product development, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent.
In 2009, we entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement, with Olympus Corporation and the "FTE Group" comprised of The Johns Hopkins University, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, The University of Texas Medical Branch, MUSC Foundation for Research Development and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, whereby the FTE Group has assigned to us a Joint Research Agreement with Olympus Corporation, including their rights in certain inventions, patents and IP rights developed by the FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement, which relate to the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery. Olympus Corporation has retained rights as a joint owner of certain inventions and related patents developed jointly by the FTE Group and Olympus Corporation under the Joint Research Agreement and retained a license granted by the FTE Group to Olympus Corporation to the inventions and related patents developed by the FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement. The patents covered by the agreement pertain to endoscopic procedures and endoscopic suturing devices that relate to the OverStitch products and may also be incorporated into potential new products that we may develop in the future. As consideration for the assignment, we are obligated to pay to each of Olympus and the FTE Group one half of a royalty in the low single digits on net sales of our products covered by the patents, which royalty shall be reduced if related patents have expired or no longer exist. In addition, we have the right to sublicense our rights under the Joint Research Agreement to the patents and technologies. The term of the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement is through and until termination. The agreement may be terminated upon written notice a) by Olympus if we materially breach any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice, b) by the FTE Group if we materially breach any of the material terms that pertain to the FTE Group and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice or c) by us if Olympus materially breaches any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice.
Following the Merger, we also own 20 U.S. and 13 foreign issued patents and 4 pending U.S. and 6 foreign patent applications relating to technologies and inventions developed by Lpath prior to the Merger (the “Lpath IP”). The Lpath IP is not aligned with our current business activities. In January 2018, we entered into a royalty-bearing License Agreement with Echelon Biosciences, Inc., ("Echelon") under which Echelon may manufacture and sell certain antibody products covered by the Lpath IP for non-clinical research use only, clinical diagnostics and immunohistochemistry. In January 2018 we also entered into a Technology Transfer Agreement with Resolute Pharma, Inc. (“Resolute”) whereby we transferred certain scientific and research materials to Resolute and granted Resolute a license to certain patent rights related to the Lpath IP. Under the terms of the agreement with Resolute, Resolute has obligations to develop and commercialize licensed products and we maintain rights to terminate the agreement if certain development and commercialization milestones are not met. Under the agreement, Resolute is responsible to pay for any ongoing costs and fees associated with the Lpath IP, and we are entitled to a royalty for any revenues related to the Lpath IP including sales of licensed products, and a Tech Transfer Fee of $0.75 million.
Government Regulation
The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (or "FD&C Act") also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a premarket approval ("PMA") application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Device Classification
Under the FD&C Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent," as defined in the statute, to either:
•a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or 
•another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
To be "substantially equivalent," the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured.
Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification, including modification to or deviation from design, manufacturing processes, materials, packaging and sterilization that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the FDA requires a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, the applicant may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is received. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite 510(k) or PMA application(s). 
If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA's satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA's satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
The Orbera intragastric balloon is a Class III device. The OverStitch and the X-Tack devices are Class II devices. We also sell accessory products, some of which are Class I.
The Investigational Device Process
In the U.S., absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") application. Some types of studies deemed to present "non-significant risk" are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a "significant risk" to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA's approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product's safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA's regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product or a specific indication for use. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a 510(k), for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
•patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
•patients do not comply with trial protocols;
•patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;
•patients experience adverse events;
•patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial;
•device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences;
•side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA's view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or clearance of a 510(k) or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing;
•institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
•third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations or other FDA or IRB requirements;
•third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA;
•data collection, monitoring and analysis is not performed in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations;
•third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
•regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
•changes in government regulations or administrative actions;
•the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or
•the FDA concludes that our trial design is unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
The PMA Approval Process
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant's response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application is to take 180 days, although the review generally takes between one and three years, or longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
•the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA's satisfaction;
•the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;
•the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
•changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA's evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, components, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of postmarket study or surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may require postmarket surveillance for certain devices approved under a PMA or cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility, devices where the failure of which would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, or devices expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•the FDA's QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
•advertising and promotion requirements;
•restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
•PMA annual reporting requirements;
•PMA approval or clearance of a 510(k) for product modifications;
•medical device reporting ("MDR"), regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health;
•recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
•unique device identifier and device tracking requirements; and
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained authorization to manufacture from the FDA. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA Office of Compliance within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Our business is regulated by laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by significant criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Anti-Kickback Statute
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, recommending, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for, a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including payments to physicians or other providers, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything of value at less than fair market value. The Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") are responsible for enforcing the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the OIG is primarily responsible for identifying fraud and abuse activities affecting government healthcare programs.
Penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include substantial criminal fines and/or imprisonment, substantial civil fines and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and do not include comparable exceptions to those provided by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
The OIG has issued safe harbor regulations that identify activities and business relationships that are not treated as offenses under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These safe harbors exist for various types of arrangements, including certain investment interests, leases, personal service arrangements, discounts and management contracts. The failure of a particular activity to comply with all requirements of an applicable safe harbor regulation does not mean that the activity violates the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or that prosecution will be pursued. However, activities and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG.
In recent years, the federal government and several states have enacted legislation requiring biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies to establish marketing compliance programs and file periodic reports on sales, marketing and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and available guidance is limited.
Federal False Claims Act
The federal False Claims Act ("FCA") prohibits knowingly filing or causing the filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. A claim that is filed pursuant to an unlawful kickback may be a false claim under this law and, in a number of cases, manufacturers of medical products have entered into settlements based on FCA allegations that their financial relationships with customers "caused" these customers to submit false claims. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Private individuals can file suits under the FCA on behalf of the government. These lawsuits are known as "qui tam" actions, and the individuals bringing such suits, sometimes known as "relators" or, more commonly, "whistleblowers," may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Since complaints related to “qui tam” actions are initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before a defendant is even aware of such action. 
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
HIPAA also protects the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates. HIPAA restricts the use and disclosure of patient health information, including patient records. Although we believe that HIPAA does not apply directly to us, most of our customers have significant obligations under HIPAA, and we intend to cooperate with customers and others to ensure compliance with HIPAA with respect to patient information. Failure to comply with HIPAA obligations can result in civil fines and/or criminal penalties. Some states have also enacted rigorous laws or regulations protecting the security and privacy of patient information.
Transparency Reporting
In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ("ACA").
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act ("PPSA"), which is part of the ACA, requires manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians, certain non-physician healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals and to report this data to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted in several states, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. In addition to reporting, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. Failure to report may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.
International Regulation
Our business is also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which our products are sold. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The European Union ("EU") requires that Apollo Endosurgery’s devices comply with the Medical Device Directive. The Medical Device Directive is being replaced 
by the Regulation 2017/745 on Medical Devices, or the MDR, effective May 26, 2021. The MDR contains additional requirements beyond those required to comply with the directives they replace, and often require the submission of more detailed data to support approval. Notably, the requirements for clinical evidence and postmarket surveillance are more rigorous. All affected companies must comply with the MDR by May 26, 2021, specifically the transition requirements dealing with registration, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance reporting. To support compliance under the MDR, we intend to obtain additional clinical data for Orbera 365. We are in the process of determining the regulatory pathway, including determining requisite clinical evidence requirements, for pursuing a CE mark for the X-Tack product. 
In order to place a medical device in the European market, a CE mark must be obtained. To obtain a CE Mark, medical devices must meet certain minimum standards of safety and quality and, depending on which class of medical device they fall into, as such classes are defined in the MDR for the new regime, they may need to undergo an appropriate conformity assessment procedure conducted by a Notified Body. A Notified Body will, amongst other things, assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and verify that the subject device conform to the requirements set out in the relevant legislation. Once the appropriate conformity assessment procedure for the medical device has been completed, a declaration of conformity will be created and the manufacturer will affix the CE mark to the device. The device can then be marketed throughout the European Economic Area (being the Member States of the EU, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Notified bodies may perform surveillance and unannounced audits at the manufacturer and critical suppliers with respect to the devices covered by the certificates issued by them. If non-conformities raised during the audits are not remedied in a timely manner by the manufacturer, the notified body may (partially or wholly) suspend or withdraw the certificate concerned. 
In the EU, we are also required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell products and are subject to regulations and periodic review from various regulatory bodies in other countries where our products are sold. Lack of regulatory compliance in any of these jurisdictions could limit our ability to distribute products in these countries. Additionally, we are subject to foreign laws and regulations governing the marketing and promotion of our products including transparency reporting obligations.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities and employees (such as physicians at state-owned or state-operated hospitals) and are therefore subject to various anti-bribery laws.
Other Regulations
We are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our products is subject to compliance with various international and federal laws and regulations and by various foreign, state and local agencies.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 158 full-time employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Our non-U.S. employment contracts comply with the applicable country mandated collective agreement in the locations where we operate. We have never experienced any work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
