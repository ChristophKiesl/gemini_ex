Recent Developments
Refer to “Fiscal Year 2022 Highlights” in “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K.
The risks and uncertainties regarding the future of our business due to the impact of COVID-19 and regulatory uncertainty, combined with our historical lack of profitability, have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.
Business Update Regarding COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting employers, employees, communities and business operations, as well as the world’s economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.
To date, we have been able to continue our operations and do not anticipate any material interruptions in the foreseeable future. However, we are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our industry and our company.
Marijuana Industry Overview
As of December 2022, there are a total of 38 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have passed legislation related to medicinal cannabis. Of these states, 21, plus the District of Columbia, have legalized recreational cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”). The CSA classifies cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse and has no currently-acceptable use for medical treatment.
Although the possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis for medical and adult use is permitted in California, Oregon, and Nevada, cannabis is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding cannabis may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability, and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
Our Marijuana Dispensaries, Cultivation and Manufacturing Operations
Black Oak Gallery/Blüm Oakland
On April 1, 2016, we acquired Black Oak Gallery, which operates a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California under the name “Blüm”. Blüm opened its retail storefront in Oakland, California in November 2012.

In addition to multiple grades of medical and adult use marijuana, Blüm sells edibles, which include cannabis-infused baked goods, chocolates, and candies; cannabis-infused topical products, such as lotions, massage oils and balms; clones of marijuana plants; and numerous kinds of cannabis concentrates, such as hash, shatter and wax. Blüm Oakland’s location consists of a retail dispensary storefront, a distribution area and a gated 20-car capacity parking lot with armed security.
Blüm San Leandro
We incorporated Blüm San Leandro on October 14, 2016, which is a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary and delivery service in San Leandro, California originally operating under the name “Silverstreak”.

The San Leandro dispensary opened on January 11, 2019. In June 2022, the San Leandro dispensary was temporarily closed and reopened in December 2022 under the name “Blüm”.

On October 26, 2017, the Company entered into joint venture agreements with NuLeaf Sparks Cultivation, LLC and NuLeaf Reno Production, LLC (collectively, “NuLeaf”) to build and operate cultivation and production facilities for our brand of cannabis products in Nevada. The agreements were subject to approval by the State of Nevada, the City of Sparks and the City of Reno in Nevada.
