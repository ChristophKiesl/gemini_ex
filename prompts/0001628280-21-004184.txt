Item 1. Business
Corporate History:
We were formed as a Nevada corporation on May 14, 2008. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 19, 2008, by and between Vertex Holdings, L.P. (formerly Vertex Energy, L.P.), a Texas limited partnership (“Holdings”), us, World Waste Technologies, Inc., a California corporation (“WWT” or “World Waste”), Vertex Merger Sub, LLC, a California limited liability company and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Subsidiary”), and Benjamin P. Cowart, our Chief Executive Officer, as agent for our shareholders (as amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”). Effective on April 16, 2009, World Waste merged with and into Merger Subsidiary, with Merger Subsidiary continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, (i) each outstanding share of World Waste common stock was cancelled and exchanged for 0.10 shares of our common stock; (ii) each outstanding share of World Waste Series A preferred stock was cancelled and exchanged for 0.4062 shares of our Series A preferred stock; and (iii) each outstanding share of World Waste Series B preferred stock was cancelled and exchanged for 11.651 shares of our Series A preferred stock.
Additionally, as a result of the Merger, as the successor entity of World Waste, we assumed World Waste’s filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission and our common stock began trading on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board under the symbol “VTNR.OB” effective May 4, 2009. Subsequently, effective February 13, 2013, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “VTNR”, where it has continued to trade. 
Prior Material Acquisitions and Transactions

Effective as of August 31, 2012, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Vertex Acquisition Sub, LLC (“Acquisition Sub”), a special purpose entity consisting of substantially all of the assets of Holdings and real-estate properties of B & S Cowart Family L.P. (“B&S LP” and the “Acquisition”). Prior to closing the Acquisition, Holdings contributed to Acquisition Sub substantially all of its assets and liabilities relating to the business of transporting, storing, processing and re-refining petroleum products, crudes and used lubricants, including all of the outstanding equity interests in Holdings’ wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Cedar Marine Terminals, L.P. (“CMT” or "Cedar Marine Terminals"), which operates a 19-acre bulk liquid storage facility and terminal on the Houston Ship Channel, which serves as a truck-in, barge-out facility and provides throughput terminal operations and which terminal is also the site of our proprietary, patented, Thermal Chemical Extraction Process ("TCEP") (described below); Crossroad Carriers, L.P.

Additionally, Chris Carlson, our Chief Financial Officer, owned a 10% interest in Holdings at the time of the acquisition.
Omega Refining Acquisition
In May, 2014, we acquired certain of the assets of Omega Refining, LLC (“Omega Refining”), Bango Refining NV, LLC (“Bango Refining”) and Omega Holdings Company LLC (“Omega Holdings” and collectively with Omega Refining and Bango Refining, “Omega” or the “sellers”) related to (1) the operation of oil re-refineries and, in connection therewith, purchasing used lubricating oils and re-refining such oils into processed oils and other products for the distribution, supply and sale to end-customers and (2) the provision of related products and support services. The assets included Omega’s Marrero, Louisiana plant which produces vacuum gas oil (VGO) and a Bango, Nevada plant which produces base lubricating oils. We acquired the assets in the name of our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex Refining LA, LLC. The assets and operations acquired from Omega fall under our Black Oil segment. Bango Refining operations were sold in January 2016.
Heartland Acquisition
    In December, 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Warren Ohio Holdings Co., LLC, f/k/a Heartland Group Holdings, LLC (“Heartland”) related to and used in an oil re-refinery and, in connection with the collecting, aggregating and purchasing of used lubricating oils and the re-refining of such oils into processed oils and other products for the distribution, supply and sale to end-customers, including raw materials, finished products and work-in-process, equipment and other fixed assets, customer lists and marketing information, the name ‘Heartland’ and other related trade names, Heartland’s real property relating to its used oil refining facility located in Columbus, Ohio, the ownership of 65% of which was transferred to Tensile in connection with the Heartland SPV (discussed below), effective January 1, 2020, used oil storage and transfer facilities located in Columbus, Zanesville and Norwalk, Ohio, and leases related to storage and transfer facilities located in Zanesville, Ohio, Mount Sterling, Kentucky, and Ravenswood, West Virginia (collectively, the “Heartland Assets”).

Myrtle Grove Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement

On July 26, 2019 (the “MG Closing Date”), Vertex Refining Myrtle Grove LLC (“MG SPV”), a Delaware limited liability company, which entity was formed as a special purpose vehicle in connection with the transactions, described in greater detail below, Vertex Operating, Tensile-Myrtle Grove Acquisition Corporation (“Tensile-MG”), an affiliate of Tensile Capital Partners Master Fund LP, an investment fund based in San Francisco, California (“Tensile”), and solely for the purposes of the MG Guaranty (defined below), the Company, entered into and closed the transactions contemplated by a Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement (the “MG Share Purchase”).

Prior to entering into the MG Share Purchase, Vertex Operating’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Vertex Refining LA, LLC, (“Vertex LA”), transferred all of the operating assets owned by it and related to the planned development of the MG Refinery (as defined below), which the parties agreed had a fair market value of $22,666,667, to MG SPV in consideration for 21,667 Class A Units and 1,000 Class B Units of MG SPV, which units were distributed to Vertex Operating. At the closing of the MG Share Purchase (on the MG Closing Date), Vertex Operating sold 1,000 of the Class B Units to Tensile-MG in consideration of the payment to it of $1 million by Tensile-MG, and Tensile-MG purchased an additional 3,000 Class B Units directly from MG SPV for $3 million (less Tensile’s fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction, totaling $850,000).

As a result of the transaction, Tensile, through Tensile-MG, acquired an approximate 15% ownership interest in MG SPV, which in turn now owns the Company’s former Belle Chasse, Louisiana, re-refining complex (the “MG Refinery”). Vertex Operating owns the remaining 85% of MG SPV.

MG SPV Limited Liability Company Agreement
 The Class B Units held by Tensile-MG are convertible into Class A Units at the option of Tensile-MG, as provided in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of MG SPV dated July 25, 2019 (the “MG Company Agreement”), based on a conversion price (initially one-for-one) which may be reduced from time to time if new Units of MG SPV are issued, and automatically convert into Series A Units upon certain events described in the MG Company Agreement.
Additionally, the Class B Unit holders may force MG SPV to redeem the outstanding Class B Units at any time on or after the earlier of (a) July 26, 2024 and (ii) the occurrence of an MG Triggering Event (defined below)(an “MG Redemption”). The cash purchase price for such redeemed Class B Units is the greater of (y) the fair market value of such units (without discount for illiquidity, minority status or otherwise) as determined by a qualified third party agreed to in writing by a majority of the holders seeking an MG Redemption and Vertex Operating (provided that Vertex Operating still owns Class A Units on such date) and (z) the original per-unit price for such Class B Units plus any unpaid Class B preference. The preference is defined as the greater of the (A) aggregate unpaid Class B yield, equal to 22.5% per year and (B) amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class B Unit holders through such MG Redemption date. “MG Triggering Events” mean (a) any dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, (b) any sale, lease, license or disposition of any material assets of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, (c) any transaction or series of related transactions (whether by merger, exchange, contribution, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization, combination or otherwise) involving the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, the result of which is that the holders of the voting securities of the relevant entity as of the MG Closing Date are no longer the beneficial owners, in the aggregate, after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the entity, subject to certain other requirements set forth in the MG Company Agreement, (d) the failure of Vertex Operating to operate MG SPV in good faith with appropriate resources, or (e) the material failure of the 
Company and its affiliates to comply with the terms of the contribution agreement, whereby the Company contributed assets and operations to MG SPV.
    Distributions of available cash of MG SPV pursuant to the MG Company Agreement (including pursuant to liquidations of MG SPV), subject to certain exemptions set forth therein, are to be made (a) first, to the holders of the Class B Units, in an amount equal to the greater of (A) the aggregate unpaid “Class B Yield” (equal to an annual return of 22.5% per annum) and (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class B Unit holders (initially Tensile-MG)(such aggregate capital invested by the Class B Unit holders, the “MG Invested Capital”, which totals $3 million as of the Closing Date), less prior distributions (the greater amount of (A) and (B), the “Class B Priority Distributions”); (b) second, the Class B Unitholders, together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive an amount equal to the aggregate MG Invested Capital; (c) third, the Class A Unitholders (other than Class A Unitholders which received Class A Units upon conversion of Class B Units), together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive all or a portion of any distribution equal to the sum of all distributions made under sections (a) and (b) above; and (d) fourth, to the holders of Units who are eligible to receive such distributions in proportion to the number of Units held by such holders
On or after July 26, 2022, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, may elect to purchase all of the outstanding units of MG SPV held by Tensile-MG (or any assignee of Tensile-MG) as discussed in the MG Company Agreement. 

On the MG Closing Date, Tensile-MG, Vertex Operating and the Company entered into a right of first offer letter agreement (the “ROFO Agreement”), whereby we agreed that if we, at any time, propose to issue, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or otherwise directly or indirectly dispose of any equity or debt securities of (x) MG SPV and/or (y) Cedar Marine Terminals, L.P., or any other entity formed or designated to operate the Cedar Marine Terminal in Baytown, Texas, we would provide Tensile-MG written notice of such, and Tensile-MG would have thirty days to purchase the amount of securities offered on terms at least as favorable as those in the original proposal. The rights under the ROFO Agreement continue to apply until such time, if ever, as Tensile-MG has acquired $50 million of securities pursuant to the terms thereof.

Heads of Agreement

On January 10, 2020, Vertex Operating entered into a Heads of Agreement (the “Heads of Agreement”) with Bunker One (USA) Inc., which is owned by Bunker Holding, a Danish holding company (“Bunker One”). Pursuant to the Heads of Agreement, the Company and Bunker One agreed to form a joint decision-making body (the “JDMB”) to focus on strategic matters related to the overall cooperation of the parties and to establish rules and procedures for identifying and undertaking joint projects. The JDMB has six members, three each from the Company and Bunker One.

The goal of the parties, pursuant to the Heads of Agreement and the JDMB, is to jointly develop and acquire direct or indirect equity or equity-related interests in projects and companies in the marine fuel sector in North America, with Bunker One focusing on opportunities related to the supply and optimization of marine fuels or components and the Company focusing on business opportunities relating to refining of bunker fuels.

For each project that the parties agree to pursue, the parties will enter into a form of Co-Operation and Joint Supply and Marketing Agreement (each a “Co-Operation JSMA”). The principal objective of each such Co-Operation JSMA will be the expansion of the business of each party by cooperating in the sourcing, storing, transportation, marketing and selling of products, where: (a) Vertex is primarily responsible for the sourcing and storing of the product (bunker fuels); (b) Bunker One is primarily responsible for the transporting, blending, marketing, selling and delivering of the product (bunker fuels); (c) Bunker One is responsible for the risk management/exposure (e.g. hedging) of the bunker fuels; and (d) Bunker One is the exclusive seller of the product to third parties.

The Heads of Agreement also allows for certain projects outside of the scope of Co-Operation JSMA’s which will be subject to separate Authorization for Expenditures agreed to by the JDMB.

The Heads of Agreement has a term of ten years, beginning effective on January 1, 2020, and continuing through April 30, 2029, provided that the agreement extends for additional five-year periods thereafter unless either party provides the other at least 120 days’ notice of non-renewal before any such automatic renewal date. The agreement can also be terminated by either party upon an event of default (as described in the Heads of Agreement), subject to required thirty days’ notice of such event of default and the opportunity for the breaching party to cure. The Heads of Agreement contains standard and customary events of default, including failure to pay amounts when due, failure to comply with the terms of the agreement, insolvency and the occurrence of a Change of Control, each subject to the terms of the agreement. A Change of Control is defined in the agreement as any party (a) engaged in the bunkering business (i.e., the supplying of fuel used by ships), as to Bunker One, or (b) engaged 
in the refining business, as to Vertex, obtaining control of such applicable party by way of any transaction or series of transactions.

The Heads of Agreement also contains a right of first refusal provision, whereby if at any time Bunker One, or any of its U.S. affiliates (each a “Bunker One Party”), proposes to issue, sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise directly or indirectly dispose of (x) all or any substantial portion of its bunkering business in the United States, or, if mutually agreed, outside of the United States and/or (y) the controlling equity interests in any corporation, limited liability company or partnership that owns all or any substantial portion of the bunkering business, held by such Bunker One Party for value, the Bunker One Party is required to provide the Company written notice of such event and the Company is provided the right to make an offer to purchase such entity/assets, from such Bunker One Party, subject to the terms of the Heads of Agreement.
Additionally, under the Heads of Agreement, at any time Bunker One determines to extend its existing bunkering business to any port in North America that is not served by Bunker One as of August 1, 2019, Bunker One is required to extend to the Company the right to elect to expand the terms and conditions of the Heads of Agreement to include any such new port.

Finally, under the Heads of Agreement, if at any time the Company acquires a supply of material that the Company intends to sell in Texas, Louisiana or Alabama and that is suitable for use in Bunker One’s bunkering business in such area from a third party, or produces additional material for sale in such area, the Company is required to provide Bunker One the right to purchase such supply/material pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Heads of Agreement.

JSMA

Also, on January 10, 2020, Vertex Operating entered into a Joint Supply and Marketing Agreement (the “JSMA”), with Bunker One. The JSMA is effective as of May 1, 2020, and provides for Bunker One to acquire 100% of the production from the Company’s Marrero, Louisiana re-refining facility (which produces approximately 100,000 barrels per month of a bunker suitable fuel for offshore use and use as a marine vessel’s propulsion system (“Bunker Fuel”)) at the arithmetic mean of Platts #2 USGC Pipe and Platt’s ULSD USGC Waterborne on agreed pricing days less an agreed upon discount, adjusted every three months.

Pursuant to the JSMA, the parties agreed to the percentages pursuant to which net profit will be split between the parties, relating to the sale of such Bunker Fuel by Bunker One, which is to be sold in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and areas immediately adjacent thereto if mutually agreed (collectively, the “Area”).

Pursuant to the JSMA, (i) the Company is primarily responsible for the sourcing and storing of the feedstock which is used to produce the Bunker Fuel, (ii) Bunker One is primarily responsible for the transporting, blending, marketing, selling and delivering of the Bunker Fuel, (iii) Bunker One is responsible for the risk management/exposure (e.g., hedging) of the Bunker Fuel, and (iv) Bunker One is the exclusive seller of the Bunker Fuel to third parties.

The Bunker Fuel is meant for blending by Bunker One into other products for the purpose of being transformed into bunker suitable fuel for a marine vessel’s propulsion system and/or marketable wholesale products in various other markets for sale by Bunker One to customers in the Area.

Pursuant to the JSMA, the Company agreed that during the term of the agreement, neither the Company, nor any affiliate of the Company, would sell any Bunker Fuel to any customers for their use as bunker fuel other than pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

Payment for the Bunker Fuel is required to be made by Bunker One within three days after invoiced by the Company, and at the end of each three months during the term of the agreement, Bunker One is required to provide a detailed accounting to the Company setting forth the consideration due to the Company and the calculation of such amounts. The agreement also provides for a yearly accounting by Bunker One and true up of amounts paid and due throughout such year.

The JSMA has a term from May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2029, provided that the term is automatically renewable for additional five-year periods thereafter unless either party provides the other at least 120 days prior written notice of non-renewal, prior to any automatic renewal date. The agreement can also be terminated by either party upon an event of default (as described in the JSMA), subject to required ten days’ notice of such event of default and the opportunity for the breaching party to cure. The Heads of Agreement contains standard and customary events of default, including failure to pay amounts when due, failure to comply with the terms of the agreement and insolvency, each subject to the terms of the agreement. In the event that the individual or group of individuals who ultimately own or control each party or such party’s parent as of May 1, 2020 no 
longer has the right or ability to control or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, the agreement can be terminated immediately by the party not subject to such change of control.
The JSMA prohibits either party from promoting activities which compete against the other party’s business in the Area for the term of the agreement and for two years thereafter.

The JSMA also provides, during the term of such agreement, for Bunker One to be allowed to have a representative attend meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company and the committees of the Board (in a non-voting observer capacity)(the “Board Observer Right”). The Board Observer Right was provided partially in connection with Bunker One’s agreement to acquire up to $5 million of the Company’s securities which it did through the purchase of shares of Series B1 Preferred Stock (which shares have since been converted into common stock) and common stock, in privately negotiated purchases, with holders of the Company’s Series B1 Preferred Stock.
Heartland Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement

On January 17, 2020 (the “Heartland Closing Date”), a Share Purchase and Subscription Agreement (the “Heartland Share Purchase”) by and among HPRM LLC (“Heartland SPV”), a Delaware limited liability company, which entity was formed as a special purpose vehicle in connection with the transactions, described in greater detail below, Vertex Operating, Tensile-Heartland Acquisition Corporation (“Tensile-Heartland”), an affiliate of Tensile, and solely for the purposes of the Heartland Guaranty (defined below), the Company, was entered into.

Prior to entering into the Heartland Share Purchase, the Company transferred 100% of the ownership of Vertex Refining OH, LLC, its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary (“Vertex OH”) to Heartland SPV in consideration for 13,500 Class A Units, 13,500 Class A-1 Preferred Units and 11,300 Class B Units of Heartland SPV and immediately thereafter contributed 248 Class B Units to Vertex Splitter, as a contribution to capital.

Vertex OH owns the Company’s Columbus, Ohio, Heartland facility, which produces a base oil product that is sold to lubricant packagers and distributors.

Pursuant to the Heartland Share Purchase, Vertex Operating sold Tensile-Heartland the 13,500 Class A Units and 13,500 Class A-1 Preferred Units of Heartland SPV in consideration for $13.5 million. Also, on the Heartland Closing Date, Tensile-Heartland purchased 7,500 Class A Units and 7,500 Class A-1 Units in consideration for $7.5 million directly from Heartland SPV.

Concurrently with the closing of the transactions described above, and pursuant to the terms of the Heartland Share Purchase, the Company, through Vertex Operating, purchased 1,000 newly issued Class A Units from MG SPV at a cost of $1,000 per unit ($1 million in aggregate).
The Heartland Share Purchase provides Tensile-Heartland an option, exercisable at its election, any time after the Heartland Closing Date, subject to the terms of the Heartland Share Purchase, to purchase up to an additional 7,000 Class A-2 Preferred Units at a cost of $1,000 per Class A-2 Preferred Unit from Heartland SPV.

The Heartland Share Purchase also provided for a guarantee by the Company to Tensile-Heartland of the payment obligations of Vertex Operating as set forth in the Heartland Share Purchase (the “Heartland Guaranty”).

The Heartland Share Purchase had an effective date of January 1, 2020.

Administrative Services Agreement
Pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement, entered into on the Heartland Closing Date, Heartland SPV engaged Vertex Operating and the Company to provide administrative/management services and day-to-day operational management services of Heartland SPV in connection with the collection, storage, transportation, transfer, refining, re-refining, distilling, aggregating, processing, blending, sale of used motor oil, used lubricants, wholesale lubricants, recycled fuel oil, or related products and services such as vacuum gas oil, base oil, and asphalt flux, in consideration for a monthly fee. The Administrative Services Agreement has a term continuing until the earlier of (a) the date terminated with the mutual consent of the parties; (b) a liquidation of Heartland SPV; (c) a Heartland Redemption (defined below); (d) the determination of Heartland SPV to terminate following a change of control (as described in the Administrative Services Agreement) of Heartland SPV or the Company; or (e)  written notice from the non-breaching party upon the occurrence of a breach which is not cured within the cure period set forth in the Administrative Services Agreement.
The Administrative Services Agreement also provides that in the event that Heartland SPV is unable to procure used motor-oil (“UMO”) through its ordinary course operations, subject to certain conditions, Vertex Operating and the Company are required to use their best efforts to sell (or cause an affiliate to sell) UMO to Heartland SPV, at the lesser of the (i) then-current market price for UMO sold in the same geography area and (ii) price paid by such entity for such UMO. Finally, the Administrative Services Agreement provides that in the event that the Heartland SPV is unable to procure vacuum gas oil (“VGO”) feedstock through its ordinary course operations, subject to certain conditions, Vertex Operating and the Company are required to use their best efforts to sell (or cause an affiliate to sell) VGO to Heartland SPV, at the lesser of the (i) then-current market price for VGO sold in the same geographic area and (ii) price paid for such VGO.
Heartland Limited Liability Company Agreement
The Heartland SPV is currently owned 35% by Vertex Operating and 65% by Tensile-Heartland. The Class A Units held by Tensile-Heartland are convertible into Class B Units as provided in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Heartland SPV (the “Heartland Company Agreement”), based on a conversion price (initially one-for-one) which may be reduced from time to time if new Units of Heartland SPV are issued and will automatically convert into Series A Units upon certain events described in the Heartland Company Agreement.
The Class A-1 and A-2 Preferred Units (“Class A Preferred Units”), which are 100% owned by Tensile-Heartland, accrue a 22.5% per annum preferred return subject to terms of the Heartland Company Agreement (the “Class A Yield”).
Additionally, the Class A Unit holders (common and preferred) may force Heartland SPV to redeem the outstanding Class A Units at any time on or after the earlier of (a)  January 17, 2025 and (ii) the occurrence of a Heartland Triggering Event (defined below)(a “Heartland Redemption”). The cash purchase price for such redeemed Class A Unit will be the greater of (y) the fair market value of such units (without discount for illiquidity, minority status or otherwise) as determined by a qualified third party agreed to in writing by a majority of the holders seeking Heartland Redemption and Vertex Operating (provided that Vertex Operating still owns Class B Units on such date) and (z) the Class A preference. The Class A preference is defined as the greater of (A) the aggregate unpaid Class A yield equal to 225% per year or (B) an amount equal to the original per-unit price for such Class A Units plus fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class A Unit holders through such Heartland Redemption date. “Heartland Triggering Events” include (a) any termination of the Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to its terms and/or any material breach by us of the environmental remediation and indemnity agreement, (b) any dissolution, winding up or liquidation of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, (c) any sale, lease, license or disposition of any material assets of the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, or (d) any transaction or series of related transactions (whether by merger, exchange, contribution, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization, combination or otherwise) involving the Company, Vertex Operating or any significant subsidiary of Vertex Operating, the result of which is that the holders of the voting securities of the relevant entity as of the Heartland Closing Date are no longer the beneficial owners, in the aggregate, after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the entity, subject to certain other requirements set forth in the Heartland Company Agreement.
In the event that Heartland SPV fails to redeem such Class A Units within 180 days after a redemption is triggered, the Class A Yield is increased to 25% until such time as such redemption is completed (with such increase being effective back to the original date of a notice of redemption). In addition, in such event, the Class A Unit holders may cause Heartland SPV to initiate a process intended to result in a sale of Heartland SPV.
Distributions of available cash of Heartland SPV pursuant to the Heartland Company Agreement (including pursuant to liquidations of Heartland SPV), subject to certain exceptions set forth therein, are to be made (a) first, to the holders of the Class A Preferred Units, in amount equal to the greater of (A) the aggregate unpaid Class A Yield and (B) an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate capital invested by the Class A Preferred Unit holders (initially Tensile-Heartland)(such aggregate capital invested by the Class A Preferred Unit holders, the “Heartland Invested Capital”, which totaled approximately $21 million as of the Heartland Closing Date, subject to adjustment as provided in the Heartland Share Purchase), less prior distributions (such greater amount of (A) and (B), the “Class A Preferred Priority Distributions”); (b) second, the Class A Preferred Unitholders, together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive an amount equal to the aggregate Heartland Invested Capital; (c) third, the Class B Unitholders (other than Class B Unitholders which received Class B Units upon conversion of Class A Preferred Units), together as a separate and distinct class, are entitled to receive all or a portion of 
any distribution equal to the sum of all distributions made under sections (a) and (b) above; and (d) fourth, to the holders of Units who are eligible to receive such distributions in proportion to the number of Units held by such holders.
On or after January 17, 2023, the Company (through Vertex Operating) may elect to purchase all of the outstanding units of Heartland SPV held by Tensile-Heartland at the greatest of (i) the amount of the Class A Priority Distributions and the amount of the Heartland Invested Capital, had the Class A Yield accrued at 30% per annum (instead of the original stated 22.5% per annum), (ii) two hundred and seventy-five percent (275%) of the total Heartland Invested Capital, and (iii) a calculation based on the greater of six (6) times the trailing twelve (12) months’ adjusted EBITDA and (B) six (6) times the next twelve (12) months’ projected adjusted EBITDA, each as described in further detail in the Heartland Company Agreement.
Upon the occurrence of a Heartland Triggering Event (described above), the Class A Unitholders (initially Tensile-Heartland) may elect, by a majority vote, to (a) terminate the Administrative Services Agreement and appoint new management of Heartland SPV, (b) trigger a Heartland Redemption, and/or (c) purchase the Class B Units from the Class B Unitholders (initially Vertex Operating) at the fair market value of such units as determined by a qualified third party agreed to in writing by the parties.
Crystal Energy, LLC
    On June 1, 2020, the Company, through Vertex Operating, entered into and closed a Member Interest Purchase Agreement with Crystal Energy, LLC ("Crystal") pursuant to which Vertex Operating agreed to buy the outstanding membership interests of Crystal for aggregate cash consideration of $1,822,690. This resulted in the recognition of $1,939,364 in accounts receivable, $976,512 in inventory, $14,484 in other current assets, and $1,107,670 in current liabilities. Upon the closing of the acquisition, Crystal became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vertex Operating.

Crystal markets its products to third-party customers, and customers will typically resell these products to retailers, end-use consumers, and others. These assets are used in our Refining segment.
Penthol Agreement Termination
  On June 5, 2016, the Company and Penthol LLC reached an agreement for the Company to act as Penthol's exclusive agent to market and promote Group III base oil from the United Arab Emirates to the United States. The Company also agreed to provide logistical support. The start-up date was July 25, 2016, with a 5-year term through 2021. Over the Company's objection, Penthol terminated the Agreement effective January 19, 2021. The Company and Penthol are currently involved in litigation involving such termination and related matters as described in greater detail in “Part II” - “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Note 4. Concentrations, Significant Customers, Commitments and Contingencies”, under the heading “Litigation”.
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. In March and April, many U.S. states and local jurisdictions began issuing ‘stay-at-home’ orders, which continue in various forms as of the date of this report. Notwithstanding such ‘stay-at-home’ orders, to date, our operations have for the most part been deemed an essential business under applicable governmental orders based on the critical nature of the products we offer.
We sell products and services primarily in the U.S. domestic oil and gas commodity markets. Throughout the first quarter of 2020, the industry experienced multiple factors which lowered both the demand for, and prices of, oil and gas. First, the COVID-19 pandemic lowered global demand for hydrocarbons, as social distancing and travel restrictions were implemented across the world. Second, the lifting of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)+ supply curtailments, and the associated increase in production of oil, drove the global supply of hydrocarbons higher through the first quarter of 2020. As a result of both dynamics, prices for hydrocarbons declined 67% from peak prices within the quarter. In addition, while global gross domestic product (GDP) growth was impacted by COVID-19 during 2020, we expect GDP to continue to decline globally for at least the early part of 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we expect oil and gas related markets will continue to experience significant volatility in 2021. Our goal through this downturn has been to remain disciplined in allocating capital and to focus on liquidity and cash preservation. We are taking the necessary actions to right-size the business for expected activity levels.
As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, some of our feedstock suppliers have permanently or temporarily closed their businesses, limited our access to their businesses, or have experienced a decreased demand for services. As a result of the above, and due to ‘stay-at-home’ and other social distancing orders, as well as the decline in U.S. travel caused by COVID-19, we have seen a significant decline in the volume of feedstocks (specifically used oil) that we have been able to collect, and therefore process through our facilities. A continued economic slowdown, period of social quarantine (imposed by the government or otherwise), or a continued period of decreased travel due to COVID-19 or the responses thereto, will likely have a material negative adverse impact on our ability to produce products, and consequently our revenues and results of operations.
The full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations currently cannot be estimated and will depend on a number of factors including the scope and duration of the global pandemic, the efficacy of, ability to manufacture a sufficient amount of, and the willingness of the general public to obtain, vaccines.
Currently we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and will generate sufficient cash through operations to support our operations for the foreseeable future; however, we will continue to evaluate our business operations based on new information as it becomes available and will make changes that we consider necessary in light of any new developments regarding the pandemic.
The pandemic is developing rapidly and the full extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact us depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, the impact of vaccines and virus mutations and the potential seasonality of new outbreaks.
Description of Business Activities:
We are an environmental services company that recycles industrial waste streams and off-specification commercial chemical products. Our primary focus is recycling used motor oil and other petroleum by-products. We are engaged in operations across the entire petroleum recycling value chain including collection, aggregation, transportation, storage, re-refinement, and sales of aggregated feedstock and re-refined products to end users. We operate in three segments: 
(1) Black Oil, 
(2) Refining and Marketing, and 
(3) Recovery. 
We currently provide our services in 15 states, primarily in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. For the rolling twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020, we aggregated approximately 75.5 million gallons of used motor oil and other petroleum by-product feedstocks and managed the re-refining of approximately 65.6 million gallons of used motor oil with our proprietary TCEP, VGO and Base Oil processes.
Our Black Oil segment collects and purchases used motor oil directly from third-party generators, aggregates used motor oil from an established network of local and regional collectors, and sells used motor oil to our customers for use as a feedstock or replacement fuel for industrial burners. We operate a refining facility that uses our proprietary TCEP and we also utilize third-party processing facilities. TCEP’s original purpose was to re-fine used oil into marine cutterstock; however, in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, that use ceased to be economically accretive, and instead, we operated TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the original purpose of TCEP once again became economically viable and at that time we switched to using TCEP to re-fine used oil into marine cutterstock; provided that with the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock during early 2020, we switched back to using TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana, and continuing through the filing date of this report. 
We also operate a facility in Marrero, Louisiana, which facility re-refines used motor oil and also produces VGO and own 85% of an entity which owns a re-refining complex in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, which we call our Myrtle Grove facility.
Our Refining and Marketing segment aggregates and manages the re-refinement of used motor oil and other petroleum by-products and sells the re-refined products to end customers. In addition, we are distributing refined motor fuels such as gasoline, blended gasoline products and diesel used as engine fuels, to third party customers who typically resell these products to retailers and end consumers.
    Our Recovery segment includes a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams as well as metals which includes transportation and marine salvage services throughout the Gulf Coast.
Black Oil Segment
Our Black Oil segment is engaged in operations across the entire used motor oil recycling value chain including collection, aggregation, transportation, storage, refinement, and sales of aggregated feedstock and re-refined products to end users. We collect and purchase used oil directly from generators such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations. We own a fleet of 41 collection vehicles, which routinely visit generators to collect and purchase used motor oil. We also aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 50 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours.
We manage the logistics of transport, storage and delivery of used oil to our customers. We own a fleet of 30 transportation trucks and more than 80 aboveground storage tanks with over 8.6 million gallons of storage capacity. These assets are used by both the Black Oil segment and the Refining and Marketing segment. In addition, we also utilize third parties for the transportation and storage of used oil feedstocks. Typically, we sell used oil to our customers in bulk to ensure efficient delivery by truck, rail, or barge. In many cases, we have contractual purchase and sale agreements with our suppliers and customers, respectively. We believe these contracts are beneficial to all parties involved because it ensures that a minimum volume is purchased from collectors and generators, a minimum volume is sold to our customers, and we are able to minimize our inventory risk by a spread between the costs to acquire used oil and the revenues received from the sale and delivery of used oil. Also, as discussed above under “Description of Business Activities”, from time to time, when market conditions warrant (i.e., when oil prices are sufficiently high), we have used our proprietary TCEP technology to re-refine used oil into marine fuel cutterstock. Due to the recent decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock, since the first quarter of 2020, we have used TCEP solely to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. In addition, at our Marrero, Louisiana facility, we produce a Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) product that is sold to refineries as well as to the marine fuels market. At our Columbus, Ohio facility (Heartland Petroleum), the ownership of 65% of which was transferred to Tensile in connection with the Heartland SPV (discussed above), effective January 1, 2020, we produce a base oil product that is sold to lubricant packagers and distributors.
Refining and Marketing Segment
Our Refining and Marketing segment is engaged in the aggregation of feedstock, re-refining it into higher value end products, and selling these products to our customers, as well as related transportation and storage activities. We aggregate a diverse mix of feedstocks including used motor oil, petroleum distillates, transmix and other off-specification chemical products. These feedstock streams are purchased from pipeline operators, refineries, chemical processing facilities and third-party providers, and are also transferred from our Black Oil segment. We have a toll-based processing agreement in place with KMTEX to re-refine feedstock streams, under our direction, into various end products that we specify. KMTEX uses industry standard processing technologies to re-refine our feedstocks into pygas, gasoline blendstock and marine fuel cutterstock. We sell all of our re-refined products directly to end-customers or to processing facilities for further refinement. In addition, we are distributing refined motor fuels such as gasoline, blended gasoline products and diesel used as engine fuels, to third party customers who typically resell these products to retailers and end consumers.
Recovery Segment
The Company’s Recovery Segment includes a generator solutions company for the proper recovery and management of hydrocarbon streams, the sales and marketing of Group III base oils and other petroleum-based products, together with the recovery and processing of metals.
Thermal Chemical Extraction Process
We own the intellectual property for our patented TCEP. TCEP is a technology which utilizes thermal and chemical dynamics to extract impurities from used oil which increases the value of the feedstock. We intend to continue to develop our TCEP technology and design with the goal of producing additional re-refined products, including lubricating base oil.
TCEP differs from conventional re-refining technologies, such as vacuum distillation and hydrotreatment, by relying more heavily on chemical processes to remove impurities rather than temperature and pressure. Therefore, the capital requirements to build a TCEP plant are typically much less than a traditional re-refinery because large feed heaters, vacuum distillation columns, and a hydrotreating unit are not required. The end product currently produced by TCEP is used as fuel oil cutterstock. Conventional re-refineries produce lubricating base oils or product grades slightly lower than base oil that can be used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blendstocks.
We currently estimate the cost to construct a new, fully-functional, commercial facility using our TCEP technology, with annual processing capacity of between 25 and 50 million gallons at another location would be approximately $10 - $15 million, which could fluctuate based on throughput capacity. The facility infrastructure would require additional capitalized expenditures which would depend on the location and site specifics of the facility. Our TCEP technology converts feedstock into a low sulfur marine fuel that can be sold into the new 0.5% low sulfur marine fuel specification mandated under International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules which went into effect on January 1, 2020. As described above, due to the decline in oil prices and challenges in obtaining feedstock in the early part of 2020, we are currently using TCEP for the purposes of pre-treating our used motor oil feedstock prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana. We have no current plans to construct any other TCEP facilities at this time. 
Organizational Structure
    The following chart reflects our current organization structure, including significant subsidiaries (all of which are wholly-owned, except as discussed below):
Our Industry
The used oil recycling industry is comprised of multiple participants including generators, collectors, aggregators, processors, and end users. Generators are entities that generate used oil through their daily operations such as automotive businesses conducting oil changes on consumer and commercial vehicles and industrial users changing lubricants on machinery and heavy equipment. Collectors are typically local businesses that purchase used oil from generators and provide on-site collection services. The collection market is highly fragmented and we believe there are more than 400 used oil collectors in the United States. Aggregators are specialized businesses that purchase used oil and petroleum by-products from multiple collectors and sell and deliver it as feedstock to processors. Processors, or re-refineries, utilize a processing technology to convert the used oil or petroleum by-product into a higher-value feedstock or end-product. Used oil is any oil that has been refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and, as a result of such use, is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. Physical impurities could include contamination by metal shavings, sawdust, or dirt. Chemical impurities could include contamination by water or benzene, or degradation of lubricating additives.
Conventional re-refineries typically employ vacuum distillation and hydrotreating processes to transform used oil into various grades of base oil. Vacuum distillation is a process that removes emulsified contaminated water and separates used oil 
into vacuum gas oil and light fuels. The vacuum gas oil is then hydrotreated to produce lubricating base oil. Hydrotreating is a process which combines chemical catalysts, heat, and pressure to remove impurities such as sulfur, chlorine, and oxygen and to stabilize the end product. A re-refined lubricating base oil is of equal quality and will last as long as a virgin base oil. In addition, other re-refining processes transform used oil into product grades slightly lower than base oil. These products, along with vacuum gas oil and the end product produced by TCEP, are commonly referred to as intermediate products and are used as industrial fuels or transportation fuel blendstocks.
The petroleum by-products industry is driven by the financial and environmental benefits of recycling, as well as by the amount of petroleum by-product generated each year. Used oil is typically used: (a) as an industrial burner oil, where the used oil is dewatered, filtered and demineralized for use in industrial burners; (b) as hydraulic oil; (c) as bitumen-based products (for road surfacing and roofing); (d) as an additive in manufactured products; or (e) as a re-refined base oil for use as a lubricant, hydraulic or transformer oil - which is how the Company uses such used oil. The market value of recycled oil is based, in large part, on its end use. In general, the market price for used motor oil that is burned as an industrial fuel is driven by the cost of competing fuels, including natural gas, while the market value of re-refined used motor oil is driven by competing petroleum products. The extent to which the financial benefits of recycling used oil are realized is driven by operating efficiency in aggregating, storing and transporting used oil supply; the extent to which the used oil is re-refined; and the price spread between natural gas and crude oil.
In the U.S., we believe that of the approximately 1.3 billion gallons of used oil generated annually approximately 200 million gallons are improperly disposed (per the EPA), 200 - 250 million gallons are re-refined into lubricating base oils, 150 - 200 million gallons are re-refined into intermediate products with grades slightly lower than base oil, and 650 - 750 million gallons are burned as an industrial fuel source. We also believe that each year the U.S. generates 425 million used automotive oil filters containing 160,000 tons of iron units and 18 million gallons of oil (per data provided by the Steel Recycling Institute). We believe that the amount of used oil being re-refined into base oils and intermediate products in the U.S. will stay basically unchanged in 2021 as no additional re-refining capacity is scheduled to come on-line. As of the date of this Report, the approximate market price for used oil at the generator level is approximately $0.00 to $0.20 per gallon (which is required to be paid to acquire such used oil), the approximate market price of intermediate re-refined products ranges from $1.25 to $1.50 per gallon, and the approximate price for lubricating base oil ranges from $2.00 to $2.50 per gallon, representing a U.S. market size of approximately $1.0 - $1.75 billion for recycled oil.
As with the financial benefits of recycling used oil, the environmental benefits are also driven by its end use. Environmental regulations prohibit the disposal of used oil in sewers or landfills because used motor oil is insoluble and contains heavy metals and other contaminants that make it detrimental to the environment if improperly disposed; one gallon of used oil can contaminate up to 1 million gallons of fresh drinking water. Additionally, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, it takes 42 gallons of crude oil, but only 1 gallon of used oil, to produce 2.5 quarts of new, high-quality lubricating oil. Compared to burning used oil as an industrial fuel, re-refined oil significantly reduces the amount of toxic heavy metals and greenhouse gases and other pollutants introduced into the environment. In addition, the use of re-refined motor oil conserves petroleum that would have otherwise been refined into virgin base stock oil.
We believe that the used oil recycling market has significant growth potential through increasing the percentage of recycled oil that is re-refined rather than burned as a low cost industrial fuel. We believe that the financial and environmental benefits of re-refining used oil combined with consumer and commercial demand for high-quality, environmentally responsible products will drive growth in demand for re-refined oil and re-refining capacity in the United States. Furthermore, we believe that increasing consumer and industrial awareness of the environmental impact of improperly disposing used oil may drive additional market growth as approximately 200 million gallons of used oil generated each year are improperly disposed rather than recycled.
Used motor oil is burned by various users such as asphalt companies, paper mills and industrial facilities as an alternative to their base fuels, to offset operational costs. Therefore, the commercial price of used oil is typically slightly less than the base fuels for the burners. Similarly, re-refined oil is used as a substitute for various virgin petroleum-based products with pricing driven by the market price of crude oil. Since there is not an active marketplace for used and re-refined oil prices, we use the prices of natural gas and crude as benchmarks in our industry. Typically, the spread between crude and natural gas prices is an accurate proxy for the potential incremental value of re-refining used oil. 
Our Competitive Strengths
Large, Diversified Feedstock Supply Network.
We obtain our feedstock supply through a combination of direct collection activities and purchases from third-party suppliers. We believe our balanced direct and indirect approach to obtaining feedstock is highly advantageous because it enables us to maximize total supply and reduce our reliance on any single supplier and the risk of not fulfilling our minimum feedstock sale quotas. We collect feedstock directly from over 4,500 generators including oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries and petrochemical manufacturing operations, as well as brokers. We aggregate used oil from a diverse network of approximately 50 suppliers who operate similar collection businesses to ours. 
Strategic Relationships.
We have established relationships with key feedstock suppliers, storage and transportation providers, oil re-refineries, and end-user customers. We believe our relationships with these parties are strong, in part due to our high level of customer service, competitive prices, and our ability to contract (for purchase or sale) long-term, minimum monthly feedstock commitments. We believe that our strategic relationships could lead to contract extensions and expanded feedstock supply or purchase agreements.
Proprietary Technology.
Our proprietary TCEP technology produces a fuel oil cutterstock for the fuel oil market or a refining feedstock. We believe we are able to build TCEP re-refining facilities at a significantly lower cost than conventional re-refineries. We estimate the cost to build a TCEP plant with capacity of up to 50 million gallons at approximately $10 - $15 million, whereas a similar sized base oil plant with vacuum distillation towers and a hydrotreater can cost in excess of $50 million. Notwithstanding the lower cost of TCEP plants, with oil at its current prices, we do not believe that it makes economic sense to expand our TCEP technology at this time due to the fixed operating costs involved. 
Logistics Capabilities.
We have extensive expertise and experience managing and operating feedstock supply chain logistics and multimodal transportation services for customers who purchase our feedstock or higher-value, re-refined products. We believe that our scale, infrastructure, expertise, and contracts enable us to cost effectively transport product and consistently meet our customers’ volume, quality and delivery schedule requirements.
Scale of Operations.
We believe that the size and scale of our operations is a significant competitive advantage when competing for new business and maintaining existing customer relationships. Price is one of the main competitive factors in the feedstock collection industry and because we are able to effectively leverage our fixed operating costs and economies of scale, we believe that our prices are competitive. Through our network of suppliers and customers, we aggregate a large amount of feedstock, which enables us to enter into minimum purchase and sale contracts as well as accept large volume orders year-round. We believe this is a competitive advantage because it minimizes our suppliers’ inventory risk and ensures our customers’ minimum order volumes are satisfied. In addition, we believe our end customers prefer to work with an exclusive supplier rather than manage multiple customer relationships.
Diversified End Product Sales.
We believe that the diversity of the products we sell reduces our overall risk and exposure to price fluctuations. Prices for petroleum-based products can be impacted significantly by supply and demand fluctuations which are not correlated with general commodity price changes. For instance, in a rising commodity price environment with a significant over-supply of base oil, the price of base oil may fall precipitously while the price of gasoline increases; and in a falling commodity price environment with a shortage of base oil, the price of base oil may increase precipitously while the price of gasoline falls. We offer a diversified product mix consisting of used motor oil, fuel oil, pygas, and gasoline blendstock. We can also control our mix of end products by choosing to either resell collected feedstock or re-refine it into a higher-value product.
Management Team.
We are led by a management team with expertise in petroleum recycling, finance, operations, and re-refinement technology. Each member of our senior management team has more than 21 years of industry experience. We believe the strength of our management team will help our success in the marketplace.
Our Business Strategy
The principal elements of our strategy include:
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
 We plan to grow market share by consolidating feedstock supply through partnering with or acquiring collection and aggregation assets. Our executive team has a proven ability to evaluate resource potential and identify acquisition targets. The acquisitions and/or partnerships could increase our revenue and provide better control over the quality and quantity of feedstock available for resale and/or upgrading as well as providing additional locations for the potential future implementation of TCEP (assuming future favorable market conditions). We also intend to diversify our revenue by acquiring complementary recycling service businesses, refining assets and technologies, and other vertically integrated businesses or assets. We believe we can realize synergies on acquisitions by leveraging our customer and vendor relationships, infrastructure, and personnel, and by eliminating duplicative overhead costs.
Expand Feedstock Supply Volume
We intend to expand our feedstock supply volume by growing our collection and aggregation operations. We plan to increase the volume of feedstock we collect directly by developing new relationships with generators and working to displace incumbent collectors; increasing the number of collection personnel, vehicles, equipment, and geographical areas we serve; and acquiring collectors in new or existing territories. We intend to increase the volume of feedstock we aggregate from third-party collectors by expanding our existing relationships and developing new vendor relationships. We believe that our ability to acquire large feedstock volumes will help to cultivate new vendor relationships because collectors often prefer to work with a single, reliable customer rather than manage multiple relationships and the uncertainty of excess inventory.
Broaden Existing Customer Relationships and Secure New Large Accounts
We intend to broaden our existing customer relationships by increasing sales of used motor oil and re-refined products to these accounts. In some cases, we may also seek to serve as our customers’ primary or exclusive supplier. We also believe that as we increase our supply of feedstock and re-refined products, we will have the opportunity to secure larger customer accounts that require a partner who can consistently deliver high volumes.
Re-Refine Higher Value End Products
We intend to develop, lease, or acquire technologies to re-refine our feedstock supply into higher value end products, including assets or technologies which complement TCEP. From the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we utilized TCEP to pre-treat our used motor oil feedstocks prior to shipping to our facility in Marrero, Louisiana; however, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, we once again began using TCEP for the purpose of producing finished cutterstock until the first quarter of 2020, when such use became no longer economical due to falling oil prices, and we once again switched to using TCEP to pre-treat used motor oil feedstocks. We hope that continued improvements in our technologies and investments in additional technologies will enable us to upgrade feedstock into higher value end products, such as fuels and lubricating base oil that command higher market prices. 
Products and Services
We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of eight product categories. All of these products are commodities that are subject to various degrees of product quality and performance specifications.
Base Oil
Base oil is an oil to which other oils or substances are added to produce a lubricant. Typically, the main substance in lubricants, base oils, are refined from crude oil.
Pygas
Pygas, or pyrolysis gasoline, is a product that can be blended with gasoline as an octane booster or that can be distilled and separated into its components, including benzene and other hydrocarbons.
Industrial Fuel
Industrial fuel is a distillate fuel oil which is typically a blend of lower quality fuel oils. It can include diesel fuels and fuel oils such as No. 1, No. 2 and No. 4 diesel fuels that are historically used for space heating and power generation. Industrial fuel is typically a fuel with low viscosity, as well as low sulfur, ash, and heavy metal content, making it an ideal blending agent.
Distillates
Distillates are finished fuel products such as gasoline and diesel fuels.
Oil Collection Services
Oil collection services include the collection, handling, treatment and sales of used motor oil and products which include used motor oil (such as oil filters) which are collected from our customers. 
Metals
Metals consist of recoverable ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable metals from manufacturing and consumption. Scrap metal can be recovered from pipes, barges, boats, building supplies, surplus equipment, tanks, and other items consisting of metal composition. These materials are segregated, processed, cut-up and sent back to a steel mill for re-purposing.
Other re-refinery products
 Other re-refinery products include the sales of asphalt, condensate, recovered products, and other petroleum products.
VGO/Marine fuel sales
 VGO/Marine fuel sales relate to the sale of low sulfur fuel meeting the criteria for IMO 2020 compliant marine fuels.
The way that the product categories above fit into our three operating segments (1) Black Oil; (2) Refining and Marketing; and (3) Recovery, are indicated below:

 | Black Oil(1) | Refining and Marketing(2) | Recovery(3)
Base oil | X | | X 
Pygas | | X | 
Industrial fuel | X | X | 
Distillates | | X | 
Oil collection services | X | | 
Metals | | | X 
Other re-refinery products | X | | X 
VGO/Marine fuel sales | X | | 

(1) As discussed in greater detail above under “Black Oil Segment”, the Black Oil segment consists primary of the sale of (a) petroleum products which include base oil and industrial fuels—which consist of used motor oils, cutterstock and fuel oil generated by our facilities; (b) oil collection services—which consist of used oil sales, burner fuel sales, antifreeze sales and 
service charges; (c) the sale of other re-refinery products including asphalt, condensate, recovered products, and used motor oil; (d) transportation revenues; and (e) the sale of VGO (vacuum gas oil)/marine fuel. 
(2) As discussed in greater detail above under “Refining and Marketing Segment”, the Refining and Marketing segment consists primarily of the sale of pygas; industrial fuels, which are produced at a third-party facility (KMTEX); and distillates.
(3) As discussed in greater detail above under “Recovery Segment”, the Recovery segment consists primarily of revenues generated from the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous recyclable Metal(s) products that are recovered from manufacturing and consumption. It also includes revenues generated from trading/marketing of Group III Base Oils.
Suppliers
We conduct business with a number of used oil generators, as well as a large network of suppliers that collect used oil from used oil generators. In our capacity as a collector of used oil, we purchase feedstock from approximately 4,500 businesses, such as oil change service stations, automotive repair shops, manufacturing facilities, petroleum refineries, and petrochemical manufacturing operations, which generate used oil through their operations.
In our capacity as a broker of used oil, we work with approximately 50 suppliers that collect used oil from businesses such as those mentioned above. 
Customers
The Black Oil segment sells used oil, VGO, base oil and other petroleum feedstocks to numerous customers in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States. The primary customers of its products are packagers, distributers, blenders and industrial burners, as described above as well as re-refiners of the feedstock. The Black Oil segment is party to various feedstock sale agreements whereby we sell used oil feedstock to third parties. The agreements provide for us to sell certain minimum gallons of used oil feedstock per month at a price per barrel equal to our direct costs, plus certain commissions, based on the quality and quantity of the used oil we supply.
The Recovery segment does not rely solely on contracts, but mainly on the spot market as well as a strategic network of customers and vendors to support the purchase and sale of its products which are commodities. It also relies on project-based work which it bids on from time to time of which there is no guarantee or assurance of repeat business. 
KMTEX Tolling Agreement
On or around April 17, 2013, and effective June 1, 2012, we entered into a new Tolling Agreement with KMTEX, Ltd. (“KMTEX” and the agreement as amended to date, the “Tolling Agreement”). The Company was previously party to a tolling agreement with KMTEX which expired pursuant to its terms on June 30, 2010, provided that the parties had continued to operate under the terms of the expired agreement until their entry into the April 2013 Tolling Agreement.
Pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, KMTEX agreed to process feedstock of certain petroleum distillates, which we provide to KMTEX, into more valuable feedstocks, including pygas, gasoline blend stock and MDO/cutter stock. The Tolling Agreement had an expiration date of June 30, 2014 (the “Initial Term”), provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term (or any extension term), the agreement automatically renewed for a successive one (1) year period and could be automatically extended for up to five (5) more extension terms. 
In November 2013 and effective November 1, 2013, we entered into a First Amendment to Processing Agreement with KMTEX LLC (previously KMTEX Ltd., hereafter “KMTEX”), which amended the Tolling Agreement. The amendment formally extended the date of the initial term of the Tolling Agreement to December 31, 2015, provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term, as amended (or any Extension Term, defined below), the agreement would automatically renew for a successive one (1) year period. The Tolling Agreement could be automatically extended for up to six (6) extension terms from the end of the extended initial term. The amendment also updated the pricing terms of the original agreement and required us to make certain capital expenditures at the KMTEX facility which have been made to date.
On December 3, 2015, and effective January 1, 2016, we entered into a Second Amendment to Processing Agreement with KMTEX. The amendment formally extended the date of the initial term of the Tolling Agreement to December 31, 2016, 
provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term, as amended (or any extension term), the agreement automatically renews for a successive one (1) year period. The amendment also updated the pricing terms of the agreement.
    On December 14, 2016, and effective January 1, 2017, we entered into a Third Amendment to Processing Agreement with KMTEX. The amendment formally extended the date of the initial term of the Tolling Agreement to December 31, 2018, provided that if not terminated by either party by written notice to the other, received within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the initial term, as amended (or any Extension Term, defined below), the agreement automatically renews for a successive one (1) year period (an “Extension Term”). The Tolling Agreement can be automatically extended for up to six (6) Extension Terms from the end of the extended initial term. The amendment also updated the pricing terms of the agreement. As the Tolling Agreement, as amended, was not terminated by either party within 90 days of December 31, 2020, the term of the Tolling Agreement automatically extended for an additional one (1) year period through December 31, 2021, and such agreement can be extended for up to three (3) additional one (1) year extensions. Notwithstanding such automatic extension, as of the date of this filing, we are negotiating the terms of a further extension/renewal.
    Notwithstanding the above, either party can terminate the Tolling Agreement at any time with ninety (90) days prior written notice for any reason and with thirty (30) days written notice upon the occurrence of certain material termination events as described in greater detail in the agreement. In connection with and pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, we pay KMTEX certain monthly tank rental fees, truck and rail car fees, and processing fees based on the weight of the material processed by KMTEX, as well as certain disposal fees and other fees. Each year of the agreement, beginning on the 12-month anniversary of the effective date, the parties agreed to review and increase the fees provided for in the agreement in accordance with among other things, various consumer price index benchmarks, as mutually agreed.
The Tolling Agreement also provides that, for materials delivered to KMTEX by rail, barge, drum, or truck, KMTEX is required to obtain the Bill of Lading and Material Safety Data Sheet that accompany such materials and not accept any materials not accompanied by a Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency or other Federal or State Government). The Company is also required to indemnify KMTEX against the acceptance of any material later classified as a hazardous waste. The agreement requires KMTEX to be responsible for all leaks, spills, discharges and releases which occur in connection with the performance of the agreement, except due to the Company’s gross negligence. Finally, the agreement requires each party to indemnify the other against any liability as a result of death or bodily injury to any person, destruction or damage to property, contamination of, adverse effects on, or imminent or substantial endangerment of, or release or threat of release into the environment, or any threatened or actual release of hazardous substance, or any violation or alleged violation of or liability under any governmental laws, regulations, rules or orders to the extent caused by, arising out of or in any manner connected with such indemnifying party’s negligent acts, omissions, breaches of the agreement or failure to comply with applicable laws in the performance thereof, subject to certain exclusions described in the agreement.
Swap Agreement and Base Oil Agreement
On January 29, 2016, we (through Vertex Operating) and Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. (“Safety-Kleen”) entered into a Swap Agreement (the “Swap Agreement”). The Swap Agreement has a term of five years, beginning January 29, 2016, and automatically renews for additional one-year terms thereafter unless either party provides the other 90 days prior written notice of their intention not to renew prior to any automatic extension. Effective January 29, 2021, the Swap Agreement initial term expired and the agreement renewed for an additional year (subject to future automatic extensions).Pursuant to the Swap Agreement, we and Safety-Kleen agreed to swap certain quantities of used oil feedstock (the agreement includes monthly maximums, quarterly minimums and maximums, and annual maximums of used oil feedstock volume required to be ‘swapped’) between Safety-Kleen's plant in Nevada and our Marrero, Louisiana plant and/or the Cedar Marine Terminal in Baytown, Texas, on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis, with any shortfall in the amount of used oil feedstock ‘swapped’ on a quarterly basis, being paid for in cash based on a discount to U.S. Platts mid-range per gallon rate for Gulf Coast No. 6, 3% oil (the “Platts”). The Swap Agreement can be terminated with 30 days prior written notice in the event either party fails to meet the specifications for oil feedstock set forth in the agreement, a party fails to deliver the required minimum quarterly volumes of oil feedstock during any three consecutive quarters, or a party materially breaches a term of the agreement.
Additionally, we (through Vertex Operating) and Safety-Kleen also entered into a Base Oil Agreement on January 29, 2016 (the “Base Oil Agreement”). The Base Oil Agreement provides for us to purchase from Safety-Kleen, and Safety-Kleen to sell to us, certain required quantities of base oils and other finished lubricants described in greater detail in the Base Oil Agreement (the “Base Oil”)(the agreement contains quarterly and annual maximum volumes of Base Oil to be acquired by us). The agreement has a term of five years and automatically renews for additional one-year terms thereafter unless either party provides the other 90 days prior written notice of their intention not to renew prior to any automatic extension. Effective 
January 29, 2021, the Base Oil Agreement initial term expired and the agreement renewed for an additional year (subject to future automatic extensions).
Competition
The industrial waste and brokerage of petroleum products industries are highly competitive. There are numerous small to mid-size firms that are engaged in the collection, transportation, treatment and brokerage of virgin and used petroleum products. Competitors include, but are not limited to: Safety-Kleen, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clean Harbors, Inc.), Rio Energy, Inc., Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., and Origin Americas LLC (formerly Flex Oil Service, LLC). These competitors actively seek to purchase feedstock from local, regional and industrial collectors, refineries, pipelines and other sources. Competition for these feedstocks may result in increasing prices to obtain used motor oil and transmix feedstocks critical to the success of our business. In order to remain competitive, we must control costs and maintain strong relationships with our feedstock suppliers. Our network of generators and collectors minimizes our reliance on any single supplier. A portion of the sales of the collected and aggregated used motor oil product are based on supply contracts which include a range of prices which change based on feedstock quality specifications and volumes. This pricing structure helps to insulate us from inventory risk by ensuring a spread between costs to acquire used motor oil feedstock and the revenues received for delivery of the feedstock. We believe that price and service are the main competitive factors in the used motor oil collection industry. We believe that our ability to accept and transport large volumes of oil year round gives us an advantage over many of our competitors. In addition, we believe that our storage capacity and ability to process the streams of products we receive as well as our ability to transport the end product by barge, rail and truck provide further advantages over many of our competitors.
Employees
The Company works diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with trade schools, world-class universities, professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent.
We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique culture, collaborative working environment, shared sense of purpose, desire to do the right thing and ground-breaking work to attract talent to our Company. Although we have a broad footprint in our business, our people feel like they are amongst friends and can be themselves. We empower them to find new and better ways of doing things and the scale of our business means that careers can develop in exciting and unexpected directions.
In 2020, we hired 64 new employees at our Company. When we hire talent, they tend to stay at the company. The average employee has 5.3 years of service. On February 19, 2021, we employed 282 full-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
Seasonality
The industrial hydrocarbon recovery business is seasonal to the extent that it is dependent on streams from seasonal industries. For example, asphalt plants burn recycled waste oil in their process, placing pricing and supply availability constraints on the industry during the good weather construction and road building seasons. In our current markets, road paving typically occurs from late spring to early fall. Therefore, it is somewhat easier to procure certain waste streams during winter months when competition for used motor oil feedstock is historically not as strong. Currently we are seeing increased demand for used motor oil feedstocks throughout the year due to the addition of re-refining technologies in the marketplace.
Governmental Regulation, Including Environmental Regulation and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to stringent United States federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Additional laws and regulations, or changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that affect our business and operations may be adopted, which may in turn impact our financial condition. 
    Additionally, the U.S. Departments of Transportation, Coast Guard and Homeland Security as well as various federal, state, local and foreign agencies exercise broad powers over our transportation operations, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and permits to conduct transportation business. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations that the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency or other authorities impose, including 
regulations relating to engine exhaust emissions, the hours of service that our drivers may provide in any one time-period, security and other matters.
Our compliance challenges arise from various legislative and regulatory bodies influenced by political, environmental, health and safety concerns.
For example, changes in federal regulations relating to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether and new sulfur limitations for product shipped in domestic pipelines resulted in tightened specifications of gasoline blendstock that we were refining, causing a corresponding decrease in revenue and gross margin growth during 2016, as compared to prior years. This change in regulation, as well as other emission-related regulations, had a material impact on the entire petroleum industry, and we adapted and managed our operations by finding materials better suited to comply with these regulations. As such, it is possible that future changes in federal regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.
We must also obtain and maintain a range of federal, state and local permits for our various logistical needs as well as our planned industrial processes.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing health, safety and environmental laws and regulations to which our operations are subject.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
In the course of our operations, we occasionally generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances” and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants. We also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or “RCRA,” and comparable state statutes.
Although we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past, or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, as amended, or “CAA,” and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls.
Global Warming and Climate Change
While we do not believe our operations raise climate change issues different from those generally raised by the commercial use of fossil fuels, legislation or regulatory programs that restrict greenhouse gas emissions in areas where we conduct business or that would require reducing emissions from our truck fleet could increase our costs.
Water Discharges
We operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the United States Clean Water Act, as amended, or “CWA,” and analogous state laws for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. Among other things, these laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including into navigable waters as well as the protection of drinking water sources. Spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements under the CWA require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable 
waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill. Other requirements for the prevention of spills are established under the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, or “OPA”, which amended the CWA and applies to owners and operators of vessels, including barges, offshore platforms and certain onshore facilities. Under OPA, regulated parties are strictly liable for oil spills and must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties could be statutorily responsible.
State Environmental Regulations
Our operations involve the storage, handling, transport and disposal of bulk waste materials, some of which contain oil, contaminants and other regulated substances. Various environmental laws and regulations require prevention, and where necessary, cleanup of spills and leaks of such materials and some of our operations must obtain permits that limit the discharge of materials. Failure to comply with such environmental requirements or permits may result in fines and penalties, remediation orders and revocation of permits. Specifically, in Texas, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including those designed to protect the environment and monitor compliance with water quality. In Louisiana, we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources as to environmental and water quality issues, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission as to allocation of intrastate routes and territories for waste water transportation. We believe that we are in compliance with regulations in the states where we conduct business.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or “OSHA,” and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Transportation Regulations
We may conduct interstate motor carrier (trucking) operations that are subject to federal regulation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or “FMCSA,” a unit within the United States Department of Transportation, or “USDOT.” The FMCSA publishes and enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations, including rules on commercial driver licensing, controlled substance testing, medical and other qualifications for drivers, equipment maintenance, and drivers’ hours of service, referred to as “HOS.” The agency also performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration (licensing), insurance, and extension of credit to motor carriers’ customers. Another unit within USDOT publishes and enforces regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials, or “hazmat.” 
In December 2010, the FMCSA launched a program called Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or “CSA,” in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System, or “SMS,” which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier’s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow the FMCSA to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems. Although our trucking operations currently hold a “Satisfactory” safety rating from FMCSA (the best rating available), the agency has announced a future intention to revise its safety rating system by making greater use of SMS data in lieu of on-site compliance audits of carriers. We cannot predict the effect such a revision may have on our safety rating.
Our intrastate trucking operations are also subject to various state environmental transportation regulations discussed under “Environmental Regulations” above. Federal law also allows states to impose insurance and safety requirements on motor carriers conducting intrastate business within their borders, and to collect a variety of taxes and fees on an apportioned basis reflecting miles actually operated within each state.
    HOS regulations establish the maximum number of hours that a commercial truck driver may work. A FMCSA rule reducing the number of hours a commercial truck driver may work each day became effective in February 2012 and the compliance date of selected provisions was July 1, 2013. The rule, which is intended to reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue-related crashes and harm to driver health, prohibits a driver from driving if more than eight hours have passed since the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper berth break of at least 30 minutes and limits the use of the restart to once a week, which, on average, cut the maximum work week from 82 to 70 hours. 
    A new regulation primarily impacting our marine bunker fuel production is known as “IMO 2020”. On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (the "IMO") implemented a new regulation for a 0.50% global sulphur cap for marine fuels. Under the new global cap, ships that traverse the oceans will be required to use marine fuels with a sulphur 
content of no more than 0.50%, versus the prior limit of 3.50%, in an effort to reduce the amount of sulphur oxide and decrease pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the global shipping fleet. 
    Our Marrero facility produces and sells IMO 2020 compliant bunker fuel.
Inflation and Commodity Price Risk
To date, our business has not been significantly affected by inflation. We purchase petroleum and petroleum by-products for consolidation and delivery, as well as for our own refining operations. By virtue of constant changes in the market value of petroleum products, we are exposed to fluctuations in both revenues and expenses. We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, No. 6 Fuel Oil and refined petroleum products. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, such as futures and options. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors.
    We primarily use commodity derivative instruments as economic hedges, which are not designated as hedging instruments, and we use fair value and cash flow hedges from time to time. 
    Our objectives for holding economic hedges are to (i) manage price volatility in certain feedstock and refined petroleum product inventories and fixed-price purchasing, and (ii) lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, refined petroleum product, and refined petroleum product sales at existing market prices. 
 The purchase of our used motor oil feedstock tends to track with natural gas pricing due to the market’s typical practice of substituting used motor oil for natural gas as a fuel source for various industrial processes. On the other hand, the prices of the products that may in the future be generated through the re-refining processes that we hope to develop are expected to track with market pricing for marine diesel and vacuum-gas oil. The recent drop in oil prices has decreased the spread between the price of used motor oil, feedstock and re-refining end-products.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, trade secrets, technical know-how and other proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees.
We have five patents registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office:
