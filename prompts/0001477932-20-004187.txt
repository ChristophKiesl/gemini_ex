ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background

The Company’s primary business is conducted through its subsidiary, First Capital Venture Co., whose subsidiary, Diamond CBD, Inc. (“Diamond CBD”) is engaged in the development and sales of hemp-derived CBD oil containing products. Generically, products containing hemp-derived CBD are sold as dietary supplements.

Hemp-derived CBD is distinguishable from CBD derived from marijuana. Hemp-derived CBD contains not more than 0.3 percent of THC, while marijuana contains in excess of this amount. Marijuana is regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. We do not believe that our hemp-derived CBD products are regulated under the Controlled Substances Act, but under the Agricultural Act of 2018, known as the “Farm Bill”.

The Company maintains that all products produced and marketed by it, are in compliance with the Farm Bill and all other federal and state law and regulation.

Diamond CBD’s products are marketed under 15 brand names, including “Diamond CBD”, “Chill”, “Relax”, “MediPets” and the premium “Meds BioTech” label, as well as many others. In total, Diamond CBD offers more than 800 products in variations by flavor, concentration and size that are sold over a nationwide distribution network exceeding 550 distributors and resellers that sell to thousands of brick-and-mortar retailers and online merchants. The overall product line, because of its size, is constantly in flux as new products are added and products are culled based on several factors including, but not limited to, consumer acceptance, inventory levels, and replacement as the result of incremental improvement.

Diamond CBD also offers for sale a majority of its products direct to consumers via its website at http://www.diamondcbd.com.

Corporate History

PotNetwork Holdings, Inc., (the “Company” or the “Registrant”) was originally incorporated in Nevada in 1996 as H P Capital Corp. The Company redomiciled in Wyoming in 2004 and changed its name to My Medical CD, Ltd. From May 2016 to March 2017, the Company was known as SND Auto Group, Inc. On March 3, 2017, the Company redomiciled in Colorado, and changed its name to PotNetwork Holdings, Inc.

On January 30, 2017, the Company acquired via reverse triangular merger 100% of the ownership interest of the privately-held First Capital Venture Co., a Florida corporation. First Capital Venture Co. is the owner of Diamond CBD, Inc. selling numerous CBD Oil products at both wholesale and retail. Pursuant to the Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement, the First Capital Venture Co. shareholders exchanged their shares which they held in First Capital Venture Holdings Co. for an aggregate total of 50,000 Class A preferred shares of the Company, wherein the shareholders would own 100% of this class of stock of the Company (the “Class A Preferred Shareholders”), which in the aggregate conferred voting control of the Company. First Capital Venture Co. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company as result of the transaction. 

Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated June 8, 2017, the Company acquired all the capital stock of PotNetwork Media Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“PMG”), in exchange for 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock issued to the shareholders of PMG, and the cancellation of a $50,000 promissory note between the Company and PMG. As a result, PMG became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. PMG is the owner of the website www.potnetwork.com. Potnetwork.com is an informational website on the overall cannabis industry and does not market any products. PMG is also the publisher of a magazine titled “PotNetwork.”

The Company has two (2) wholly-owned subsidiaries:


· | First Capital Venture Co., a Florida corporation which has as its wholly-owned subsidiary, Diamond CBD, Inc., a Delaware corporation
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | PotNetwork Media Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, operator of the website, PotNetwork.com.

Hemp-derived CBD is distinguishable from CBD derived from marijuana. Hemp-derived CBD contains not more than 0.3 percent of THC, while marijuana contains in excess of this amount. Marijuana is regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. We do not believe that our hemp-derived CBD products are regulated under the Controlled Substances Act, but under the Agricultural Act of 2018, known as the “Farm Bill”. 

The 2018 Farm Bill allows for the interstate sale and transfer of hemp-derived products for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. The Farm Bill ensures that any cannabinoid—components of CBD —that is derived from hemp will be legal, if that hemp is produced in a manner consistent with the Farm Bill, associated federal regulations, associated state regulations, and by a licensed grower as defined in the Farm Bill.

The Company believes that all products produced and marketed by it, are in compliance with the Farm Bill and all other federal and state law and regulation.

Diamond CBD’s products are marketed under 15 brand names, including “Diamond CBD”, “Chill”, “Relax”, “MediPets” and the premium “Meds BioTech” label, as well as many others. In total, Diamond CBD offers over 800 products in variations by flavor, concentration and size that are sold over a nationwide distribution network exceeding 550 distributors and resellers that sell to thousands of brick-and-mortar retailers and online merchants. The overall product line, because of its size, is constantly in flux as new products are added and products are culled based on several factors including, but not limited to, consumer acceptance, inventory levels, and replacement as the result of incremental improvement.

While most of Diamond CBD’s products are geared to human health and wellness, its “MediPets” product line is a 100% natural and organic cannabinoid oil-based health and wellness solution for dogs and cats. Along with the company’s Pet CBD food for small, medium, large dogs and cats, these products offer pet owners a new way to support their pet’s mood and wellness in a non-invasive, non-toxic way. The global pet care industry is expected to reach $110 billion in 2017, according to Euromonitor Research (The State Of Global Pet Care: Trends And Growth Opportunities, September 2017). Technavio, a leading market research firm, recently analyzed the global pet care industry and forecasted a CAGR of 5% between 2016-2020 (Global Pet Dietary Supplements Market 2018-2022, March 2018). According to that report, rising pet ownership combined with increased consumer spending on premium natural and organic pet care products are fundamental factors driving that growth.

Diamond CBD also offers for sale a majority of its products direct to consumers via its website at http://www.diamondcbd.com/.

Diamond DBD’s products are grouped in the following categories:


· | Flavored and unflavored CBD oils in varying concentrations 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Vaping pens and additives 
· | Edibles such as chewable “gummies”, crumble “dabs”, and other edible forms 
· | Beverage energy/relaxation “shots” 
· | CBD topical application creams in varying concentrations (including the premium “Meds BioTech” brand)
· | Pet (dog and cat) wellness products in various dosages and delivery formats (the “MediPets” brand) 
· | Hemp Toke Hemp Cigarettes 
· | CBD bath bombs 

 
Consumer markets served by Diamond CBD are extensive. In terms of geography, the products are sold wherever legal and the Company stipulates to its distribution channels that the products may only be sold to end-user persons eighteen years of age or older (See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a further explanation of the laws regarding the sale of hemp-derived CBD products). Initially, the Company focused distribution on market segments receptive to hemp-derived CBD products, such as vape shops, smoke shops and various countercultural focused retail outlets. Distribution was greatly expanded throughout 2017 and 2018 as the result of investment in new products and channel marketing (e.g., product catalogues and sell sheets, trade show and conference attendance, channel specific sales force), resulting in a vast broadening of distribution footprint and accelerated market growth, market penetration and revenue generation. For example, with the addition of specialized product lines, such as Meds BioTech and MediPets, the Company has been able to enter into new market segments such as vitamin/supplement shops, fitness centers, wellness practitioners of various disciplines, pet supply stores, and veterinary channels.

The strategic intent of the marketing plan in 2017 and 2018, has been to create a defendable “marketing wall” around distribution channels and retail outlets to minimize competition exposure. The Company has expended more than $11,000,000 in sales and marketing in 2017 and in 2018 combined. In parallel with distribution strategies, the Company has embraced various cause-related marketing initiatives in association with non-profit entities in order to position itself as socially conscious. Diamond CBD is engaged in select target market consumer awareness and brand preference campaigns, and is launching in 2019, two new national sales programs, one to educate and sell its products to consumers in shopping malls, and one to sell its products directly to brick-and-mortar resellers in metro markets in Florida via a fleet of mobile sales vans stocked with displays and product for immediate placement.

Product Formulation and Production

Diamond CBD uses its commercial suppliers and contract manufacturers for its product research and development, formulation, quality testing, production and packaging. These suppliers and manufacturers hold, as required, the necessary regulatory and other licenses/permits specific to each one’s activity. Diamond CBD outsources fulfillment as well. The Company has adopted a drop shipment fulfillment model that allows the third-party supplier to ship the merchandise directly to each customer. Therefore, the Company does not hold any inventory. Any and all raw materials constituting active ingredients in its products are routinely tested by a third-party laboratory for purity and consistency of active ingredient concentrations. The Company owns its own propriety formulas for all its products, which it regards as trade secrets (the Company does not own any patents nor has any pending), and continuously is engaged in both new product development and product incremental improvement with its suppliers. New product development and incremental improvement costs are absorbed by each respective supplier as part of their overhead in providing services to the Company. 
Sales Channels

In addition to selling its products directly to consumers from its website, Diamond CBD, and indirectly the Company, depends upon its network of distributors and resellers to represent its product in various markets. The Company has over 500 distributors across the U.S. that distribute to thousands of points of retail distribution. No single distributor represents more than 10% of the Company’s aggregate sales volume. The Company is continuously evaluating the performance of its distributors and sales channels and periodically restructures or updates its agreements and methods of distribution. 
The Markets for Our Products

Market research firm, Brightfield Group, estimates that the CBD oil industry is growing at a rate of 55% year over year and projects that the U.S. domestic market for CBD oil products will total a minimum of $1 billion by 2020 (Forbes, August 23, 2017). 

The growth of the market shows that hemp-derived CBD products are becoming “mainstream” as consumers increasingly perceive them as providing wellness benefits.

Competition

Currently, in the United States, there are no businesses that can demonstrate or claim a dominant market share of the growing CBD products market. Competition, outside those companies that provide over 0.3 percent THC containing CBD in states where that is allowed under state law, is limited to numerous brands with geocentric distribution footprints. Overall, there are no major pharmaceutical manufacturing companies marketing general purpose CBD products into the overall CBD market at this time, although the Company is expecting such an entry in the future. Competition also includes many small regional marketers/packagers of CBD oil containing products that have limited distribution and economic resources.
Employees 

The Company has 13 full-time employees.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company holds trademark, “PotNetwork”, under U.S. registration number 86860539, registered on January 31, 2017, and expiring on January 31, 2027. It is used by the Company in its own branding and that of its website, PotNetwork.com.

The Company holds no patents, nor at this time, has any patent pending.

Government Regulation

I. The Company’s CBD Products Are Not Subject to the Controlled Substances Act 

The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (“AIA” or “the Act”) exempted hemp-derived cannabidiol products (“hemp-derived CBD products”) from the federal Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). Specifically, the AIA, also known as the Farm Bill of 2018, established a legal definition of “hemp”: the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol [∆-9 THC] concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. 

6

 
The Act amends the CSA to exclude “hemp” from the definition of “marihuana.” It also amended the CSA to exclude THC found in “hemp” from the “tetrahydrocannabinols” listed in Schedule I. Therefore, hemp-derived CBD products that contain less than less than 0.3% of 9∆-THC, such as those marketed by PotNetwork, are not controlled substances under the CSA. These amendments to the CSA took immediate effect on December 20, 2018. 

By way of background, the CSA establishes five “schedules” into which a substance with abuse potential may be classified. Substances that fall under any one of the five schedules are subject to various requirements and restrictions enforced by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). The most restrictive is Schedule I, which is reserved for those substances having a high potential for abuse that do not have a currently accepted medical use, and that lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. 

Marijuana has long been classified under Schedule I. Previously, DEA took the position that CBD met the expansive definition of “marijuana”, which made it subject to Schedule I as well. Specifically, DEA created a code number in Schedule I for “marihuana extract,” defined as “an extract containing one or more cannabinoids that has been derived from any plant of the genus Cannabis, other than the separated resin (whether crude or purified) obtained from the plant.” DEA made clear that the agency considered CBD to fall within the definition of “marihuana extract” (and to therefore be a Schedule I substance) if the CBD came from the part of the cannabis plant that is included within the definition of “marijuana.” 

The passage of the AIA confirms that hemp-derived CBD products are now excluded from the CSA. As noted above, the AIA amended the definition of “marihuana” as follows:

(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the term ‘marihuana’ means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds to resin.

(B) The term ‘marihuana’ does not include—

(i) hemp, as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. 

II. Limits of the AIA

Although the AIA removed “hemp” from the CSA, the Act has limitations. 

a. Products containing more than 0.3% of 9∆-THC still subject to the CSA. 

Notably, the AIA’s exclusion of “hemp” from the CSA definition of “marihuana” is limited to those parts, derivatives, or extracts of the plant containing less than 0.3% of 9∆-THC. Parts, derivatives, and extracts containing levels of 9∆-THC greater than 0.3% meet the definition of marihuana and are subject to the CSA. Consequently, manufacturers and distributors of CBD products must be prudent with respect to verifying the levels of 9∆-THC in products. 

b. Hemp production and cultivation restrictions 

The AIA requires the establishment of a shared Federal-state program to regulate the cultivation and production of hemp. The USDA is actively engaged in rulemaking efforts to implement these requirements and state laws are evolving in response. Our Company is not involved in the cultivation or production of hemp; however, we recognize that new rules will impact the industry as a whole and we are closely monitoring the USDA’s rulemaking efforts. 

c. Hemp-derived CBD remains subject to FDA regulatory authority

Further, The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the AIA authorize the FDA to regulate the marketing and distribution of hemp products in interstate commerce that are intended for consumption, including topical use. Pursuant to its jurisdiction, FDA may regulate hemp as a feed, food, dietary supplement, cosmetic or drug depending on the intended use of the hemp and whether the hemp is otherwise a permissible ingredient for a particular intended use. The AIA expressly preserves the FDA’s authority over “hemp” that is intended to be used as a drug, device, cosmetic, food (including animal food), dietary supplement, or tobacco product.

Generally, hemp-derived CBD products that are intended for ingestion and intended to support the normal function/structure of the body or added as an ingredient in food, may be considered a dietary supplement or conventional food under the FDCA. However, FDA has taken the position through advisory Warning Letters to multiple companies that CBD products are precluded from being marketed as dietary supplements or as food because CBD is subject to statutory exclusions designed to protect the integrity of the drug approval process.


7

 
Specifically, the statutory definition of a “dietary supplement” excludes an “article” that has been approved as a drug under section 505 of the FDCA. The term “dietary supplement” also excludes “an article” if (1) it has been authorized for investigation as a new drug; (2) substantial clinical investigations have been instituted on the article and their existence made public; and (3) it was not marketed as a food or dietary supplement prior to being authorized for investigation as a new drug. For purposes of this exclusion, the FDA has interpreted “authorized for investigation as a new drug” to mean that an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) has been submitted for the active ingredient or active moiety. 

FDA has taken the position that hemp-derived CBD cannot be marketed as dietary supplement because a CBD isolate has been approved as a drug, Epidiolex, and prior to approval, was subject to substantial clinical investigations under an IND. Further, FDA has stated that it has not been provided with the evidence needed to overcome this exclusion. The FDA asserts this same position with regard to products marketed as food under a separate, but identical, statutory provision applicable to “food” broadly. As such, FDA takes the position that hemp-derived CBD products intended for ingestion may be adulterated. 

That being said, FDA has yet to take enforcement action against CBD products and has initiated a regulatory process to determine whether there is a regulatory pathway to permit the marketing of these products. Indeed, FDA in recognizing the significant increase in hemp-derived CBD products on the market, the Agency held a public meeting on May 31, 2019, requesting scientific information and data regarding the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD. It further requested that comments be filed with the agency by July 2, 2019. This meeting and request for comments signaled FDA’s intent to consider various regulatory options for CBD products, including but not limited to (1) requiring companies to seek approval to market such product; (2) issuing regulations setting forth the conditions which such products may be marketed in food and dietary supplements; or (3) prohibiting the use of hemp-derived CBD in foods and dietary supplements. With that said, there is significant regulatory uncertainty around this category which makes it difficult to predict the likely outcome of this process FDA has initiated. 

d. Hemp-derived CBD products are subject to regulation on the state level.

Although the AIA provided clarity regarding the status of hemp-derived CBD under the federal CSA, the AIA did not address the myriad of state laws and regulations governing such products. For example, hemp-derived CBD still meets the definition of a controlled substance under certain laws.

FDA Warning Letter

PotNetwork Holdings received a Warning Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 28, 2019 related to the marketing of CBD products by Diamond CBD, a subsidiary of the Company. 

First, FDA alleged that some claims made by Diamond CBD on its website established that the products were unapproved new drugs. Specifically, FDA stated that the claims suggested that the products were intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, the definition of a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FDCA. These claims included references to clinical studies on CBD demonstrating health benefits for patients with certain diseases, including Alzheimer’s and diabetes. Based on these claims, the FDA considered the products to be unapproved new drugs in violation of the FDCA. 

Next, FDA alleged that the products cannot lawfully be marketed as a dietary supplement because the Agency has concluded that CBD is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement. Specifically, the section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FDCA excludes from the definition of “dietary supplement” articles that are active ingredients in drugs or for which substantial investigations as a drug have commenced if the substances were not marketed as food or dietary supplements prior to the approval of the drug or commencement of the investigation. CBD isolate is the active ingredient in the approved drug, Epidiolex, and substantial clinical investigations have been conducted under IND. FDA has taken the position that there is no evidence that CBD was marketed as a food and dietary supplement prior to the approval or investigation of these drugs and, therefore, the hemp-derived CBD products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement. Consequently, such products may violate the FDCA. 

Finally, 301(ll) of the FDCA prohibits food from containing an approved drug or drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted unless such drug was marketed as food prior to the approval of the drug or institution of the clinical investigation. As discussed, FDA has taken the position that there is no evidence that CBD was not marketed as food prior to substantial clinical investigations on CBD conducted under IND were made public. The Warning Letter states that the Diamond CBD products containing a Nutrition Facts panel are not appropriately marketed because the presence of CBD excludes the product from being marketed as a food. Consequently, such products may violate the FDCA.

PotNetwork has taken significant steps to respond to FDA concerns enumerated in the March 28, 2019 Warning Letter. Diamond CBD has removed all claims from the website that are referenced in the Warning Letter has suggesting that the hemp-derived CBD products are intended to be used as a drug. PotNetwork also retained Venable LLP to serve as regulatory counsel. At counsel’s instruction, Diamond CBD has also acted swiftly and removed other claims in an effort to ensure compliance with the FDCA and be responsive to FDA’s concerns.

Additionally, counsel provided a written response to the Warning Letter on April 30, 2019 identifying the changes implemented by Diamond CBD and responding to the allegations related to CBD prohibition in a dietary supplement. As of date of this filing, PotNetwork has not received a response from the Agency. Nor has it been the subject of any other enforcement action. 

Importantly, the Warning Letter did not state or imply any consumer or other complaint relating to any of Company’s products in terms of their purity, quality, or safety. 

Emerging Growth Company Status

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last date of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act. We will be deemed a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured on January 1st.

We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent, we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.

A Company that elects to be treated as an emerging growth company shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement; (iii) the date on which it has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’ as defined by the SEC, which would generally occur upon it attaining a public float of at least $700 million.
