ITEM 1. | DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
------------+----------------------------

 
Unless otherwise noted, the terms “GTX Corp”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to the ongoing business operations of GTX Corp and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Global Trek Xploration, and LOCiMOBILE, Inc. During 2014, we owned Code Amber News Service, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that was discontinued in February 2015. Accordingly, unless otherwise specified, references to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” for periods before February 2015 also refer to, and include Code Amber News Service, Inc.
 
OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS
 
GTX Corp is a holding company that currently owns and operates two subsidiaries engaged in the growing $34 billion wearable technology and IoT industry. GTX was founded in 2002, became publicly traded in 2008, and is currently headquartered in Los Angeles, California.
 
GTX provides a patented global monitoring platform that answers the “where is” question: such as, where is my mother, child, employee, pet, drone, rifle or high value asset. Through a proprietary IoT (“Internet of Things”) enterprise platform the Company offers a range of hardware, software and connectivity tracking and monitoring solutions and generates revenues through the sale of products, licensing, recurring subscriptions and professional services.
 
Since the inception of our business, GTX Corp has developed and commercially launched several products, including our most recent GPS and Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) SmartSoles, hand-held GPS tracking devices, more than 20 smartphone and tablet Apps, all supported by our hosted and scalable backend monitoring platform. The Company has four revenue streams comprising of product sales, recurring subscriptions, software and intellectual property (IP) licensing, and professional services. These core products and services are supported by GTX’s IP portfolio of issued patents, licensed patents, patents pending, registered trademarks, copyrights, URLs and a library of proprietary hardware and software.
 
In 2016, we commenced offering our products to the U.S. military for use in tracking military personnel and equipment.
 
Also in 2016, we entered into a strategic IP agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC in order to maximize the licensing potential of certain of our key patents. Under this agreement, we assigned three of our key patents to Inventergy Innovations who, in turn, will either license these patents to third parties, enforce the patents against third parties, or otherwise monetize these IP assets. We own a 45% interest in Inventergy Innovations and will receive a portion of any licensing, sales or other revenues that Inventergy Innovations generates from the monetization of the three patents. Although we assigned the three patents to Inventergy Innovations, we continue to have the right to commercially exploit the three patents in our own products.
 
There are four primary market segments that we have identified as our primary target markets:
 

1) | People with cognitive memory disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism and traumatic brain injury (“TBI”). Typically, these people have a tendency to wander and require some wander guard technology and remote oversight. In 2014 there were an estimated 5.2 million people in the United States with Alzheimer’s disease and approximately 13.9% of people age 71 and older in the United States have dementia (this number is closer to 100 million on a global basis). 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | High Value assets, such as drones, cargo and rifles.

3) | Mobile work force, such as salespersons, journalists, electricians, plumbers, food delivery, property management agents, cleaning services and other industries that require knowing the whereabouts of an employee or contractor in real time. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) | Military and law enforcement personnel and equipment. 

 
Our operations are currently conducted through two wholly-owned subsidiaries (Global Trek Xploration, Inc. and LOCiMOBILE, Inc.) that operate in various interrelated sectors of the location-based wearable technology market. Through these subsidiaries, GTX Corp is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, distribution and sales of five (5) related products and services in the GPS, cellular, BLE, RF and WiFi wearable technology personal location and wandering assistive technology business. Through a proprietary enterprise (IoT) monitoring platform and licensing subscription business model, the Company offers a complete end to end solution of hardware, middleware, apps, connectivity, and professional services that can track people or assets at the touch of a button in real-time.
 
Since the start of 2015, the Company has focused on building channels of distribution for its product lines of embedded devices, Stand-Alone devices and Digital Apps which all funnel into the GTX Corp IoT monitoring platform. Each product line is offered both direct to consumer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) through a global network of resellers, affiliates, distributors, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, manufacturers reps and retailers. The Company has been developing international product distribution and sales channels and, as of December 31, 2016, the Company had 8 regional sales reps in the U.S., 6 retired and active professional athlete brand ambassadors, over 300 online affiliates, and 15 international and domestic distributors. Also, we were issued a vendor numbers and/or orders for reimbursement in 6 U.S. states, and have applied for other State and Federal reimbursement codes, grants and private insurance reimbursement, which if granted is expected to increase the potential market for users of our SmartSole product line. All product lines are sold with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription or licensing service plans ranging from $5 to $35 per month. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 2,500 SmartSole units in the field in over 35 countries.
 
In 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark office granted us a third patent in our “286” family of patents, which patents cover key aspects of our tracking technology. These three GTX Corp patents are not limited to any particular form factor and are applicable to any generic tracking device, which, in its simplest form includes a communication device (i.e. cell phone modem, blue tooth or Wi-Fi communicator), a location detector (i.e. GPS or Wi-Fi Module) and data memory. This technology is now commonly embedded in millions of devices and smartphones, deployed across numerous industries. In order to better monetize our IP, in June 2016, we signed an agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC (“Inventergy”), a subsidiary of Inventergy Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVT). Under this agreement, Inventergy agreed to spearhead a monetization campaign for the three “286” GTX patents. Part of Inventergy’s strategy will be to require third parties that operate in related industries and potential infringers of these patents to either license the use of the patents or to otherwise acquire rights to the patents parties. Upon the signing of the Inventergy agreement, the three patents were assigned to an Inventergy subsidiary. In exchange for this assignment, GTX received a 45% interest in the Inventergy subsidiary, along with a cash and stock compensation. The Inventergy subsidiary granted GTX a non-exclusive license to use the three “286” patents. Accordingly, GTX will still retain all use rights of the three patents in GTX’s products.
 
The potential value of these 3 patents is that they extend beyond our core footwear patents and into areas such as GPS watches, fitness wearables that track location, hand-held GPS devices, tracking apps on Smartphones, standalone GPS tracking devices and location based platforms in general, which represents a very sizable addressable market.
 
Upon signing the agreement with Inventergy Innovations, LLC, its parent company, Inventergy Global, Inc., issued to GTX 42,500 restricted shares of Inventergy Global, Inc. common stock, having an initial value of $62,479. Inventergy also paid us $250,000 in 2016 consulting fees and for the rights to monitize our three patents. Starting in 2017, we expect a quarterly draw against any future licensing revenues or possible sale of the patents that Inventergy is actively engaged in monetizing.
 
In the second quarter of 2016, we signed a collaboration agreement with George Mason University’s College of Health and Human Services. In collaboration with investigators from the Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University, who have expertise in the economics of disease management and mobile health technologies, the University will utilize GTX technology and data in order to study wandering habits in elderly people with Alzheimer’s and dementia. The initial grant funded project will begin in early fall 2016 and is expected to last one year. If successful, the project will be extended for 2-3 more years with result in a set of models capable of predicting a general area or direction in which a given Alzheimer’s or dementia patient is most likely to go when becoming disoriented and/or wandering. The created preliminary models will be made available to GTX Corp, which will consider deploying the prediction algorithms into their backend monitoring platform, adding another layer of technology and overall value to the platform and monitoring services provided by the Company. This is the first entre for GTX in Big Data and Data analytics.
 
In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered a prototype of our new proprietary GPS tracking device to the U.S. military for military use, on a non-cellular, encrypted GPS technology platform. These new devices are being developed for large scale installations and bases that need to monitor the location and movement of every asset (both human and non-human) on that base, but due to the remote location of these bases and lack of conventional cellular coverage the devices utilize RF technology and are in a hardened military grade encasement. In preparation for developing an ongoing relationship with the military, we have applied for and received a System for Award Management (SAM) number and a General Services Administration (GSA) number and approval for SENSENET. We have shipped a small order of this prototype product to the military. Based on the feedback we have received from our customer, subject to budget approval, we may receive additional orders in 2017.

During 2016, we also added distributors in Mexico and Norway, and added two U.S distributors, Raco Industries and Kore Wireless, both companies with experience in the wireless and location – based industry and international channel partners and resellers. As a result, additional markets will now have access to our GPS SmartSoles.
 
In our ongoing strategy to expand our SmartSole target market beyond senior citizens and towards young adults with autism and with the recent study that claims 1/3 of autistic youngsters wander, Lynette Louise an Internationally renowned Brain Expert with two board certifications in neurotherapy and author of several books was added to our advisory board. We are currently working with Lynette to begin offering workshops and consultations for families caring for a child on the far extreme of the ASD spectrum. This new initiative is intended to strengthen our role and presence in the autistic community and to expand our product offerings in our online store.
 
Global Trek Xploration
 
Our first wholly owned subsidiary engages in the business of hardware, software, connectivity, design and development of GPS, Cellular, RF, WiFi and Bluetooth low energy (“BLE”) monitoring and tracking solutions. This includes the management and monetization of the Company’s IP portfolio. Offering a GPS and BLE location platform that enables subscribers to track in real time the whereabouts of people, or high valued assets. Our proprietary GPS device, which consists of a miniature quad band GPRS transceiver, antenna, circuitry, battery and inductive charging pad can be customized and integrated into numerous form factors whose location and movement can be monitored in real time over the Internet through our 24x7 tracking portal or on a web enabled cellular telephone. The tracking portal is fully scalable and has been licensed to several partners both in the U.S. and internationally. It is a secure platform equipped with a database, application-programming interface (“API”) for custom integration and communication SMS gateway software and hardware. Subscriber internet communications are routed through GTX’s proprietary, fault-tolerant, carrier-class, and application-specific interface software. Our Location Data Center services are also offered to non-Global Trek products and hardware systems (i.e. handsets and personal electronics) of major electronics manufacturers through the offer and sale of exclusive licenses (either geographical, regional or product categories).
 
Markets that Global Trek Xploration is currently in, or is exploring, include:
 

● | Families with members who have Alzheimer’s and or dementia, including developmentally challenged adults; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Elder care support, life-style management and e-health applications; 
● | Adults and children with cognitive disorders such as Autism and TBI; 
● | High value asset tracking and location capability of drones, bikes, motorcycles, containers, luggage, riffles and other assets that require monitoring or tracking through a miniaturized low power consumption device; 
● | Mobile work force; 
● | Security for high-level executives, field workers, first responders, journalists, government employees; 
● | Military, and law enforcement; 
● | Biometrics, health and wellness; 
● | Smart Home technology, and; 
● | Accessories and peripherals. 

Technology
 
Our current location tracking product design utilizes quad-band GSM/GPRS telephony chip sets and can be adapted to the prevalent wireless technologies, 2G, 3G or 4G. Our module’s GPS electronics, utilizing advanced “weak signal server-enhanced” technology will provide rapid location identification.
 
Each module is programmed with a unique identification number and uses standard cellular frequencies to communicate its location. The module is also programmed with a unique subscriber identification number allowing each owner to subscribe to different services.
 
We have been modifying and upgrading our modules of our SmartSoles GPS tracking product to, among other things, make it available for use in various localities without customization. We refer to the modified/upgraded versions as versions 1.25, 1.5, etc. We also placed an order for 300 units of version 1.5. The production and roll-out of version 1.5 of our SmartSole product is expected to be a benefit because, unlike the earlier versions, we no longer have to custom make SmartSoles for our international distributors with their Sim cards, so our manufacturing cost and time lines are reduced and we have more flexibility to timely meet our customers’ requirements. Also, version 1.5 of our SmartSole will now allow us to bill for data charges in over 100 countries, thereby increasing our potential markets. The ability to both produce a product that is able to be delivered to foreign market without customization and to bill for data charges in additional countries will enable us to increase our RPS (revenue per subscriber).

Global Trek Xploration has developed a “carrier-class” architecture and hosts the servers in a facility Data Center (reliable to 99.999%). The local service center runs on redundant off-the-shelf servers. This enables cost-efficient expansion, without the need for application code changes.
 
Our core tracking products (SmartSole, Take-Along-Tracker, Track my Work Force App) are supported by the existing infrastructure for the worldwide cell network that provides coverage throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and numerous other countries that operate on the global GSM Wireless networks. In addition, the personal locators will have the ability to operate on the networks of 290 carriers in over 210 countries.
 
As part of our expansion strategy/roadmap, the Company is currently exploring the development of a Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”) module that should open up new carrier relationships such as Verizon and Sprint, and territories that are predominantly CDMA, such as Japan and Korea.
 
Strategic Relationships and Licensing Arrangements
 
The main initiatives of Global Trek Xploration is to offer location based hardware and/or its IoT data monitoring platform to third parties for the sale and distribution of location based products/services in various markets. We begin the process by entering into a platform test agreement or pilot program with a potential partner with the intent to transition into a long-term relationship. By establishing and building partnerships, through licensing agreements, OEM, and carrier relationships, we facilitate efficient entry into new markets leveraging each company’s core competencies. We enhance the value of our distribution channels by aligning our sales and marketing efforts with strategic partners, including co-branding, distribution and marketing with telecommunication companies, wireless carriers, national retailers and major consumer branded companies.
 
Global Trek Xploration has the ability to customize its products to different form factors for the specific needs of its customers. To date, the Company has created three custom solutions: 1) the monitoring of seniors by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and insoles; 2) the monitoring of children by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and backpacks; and 3) the monitoring of various high value assets such as drones and other mobile assets.
 
The Company has several key strategic relationships established both on the supply side and the distribution side. Some of the key partners on the supply side are Atlantic Footcare, which manufactures our SmartSoles, Telic which manufactures our GPS and Cellular electronics and Telefonica which provides our global connectivity. On the distribution side, we have numerous partnerships worldwide, ranging from distributors, health organizations, and retailers.
 
In June of 2015, we entered into an agreement with Alroni to handle warehousing and distribution for our European customers. In December 2016, we terminated our agreement with Alroni and shifted our European consumer distribution out of Ireland and into the UK through a strategic alliance with Possum LTD, a B2B healthcare and Telehealth provider conducting business across the UK and Ireland. Founded in Buckinghamshire in 1961, Possum is today a market leader in the provision, installation and support of many types of Electronic Assistive Technology including Environmental Control Systems, Telecare, Telehealth and TECS (Technology Enabled Care and Support Services). Possum has a strong established customer base in the National Health Service, Social Services and Local Authorities and also works with reseller partners across northern Europe. We utilize a revenue share model on what is shipped, so we have no fixed overhead cost for the warehousing of inventory in Europe.
 
The Company continues to engage in new pilot programs domestically and internationally with these pilot programs being conducted by assisted living facilities, Government and Municipal agencies, Police departments, health organizations, retailers, distributors, universities; non-profits, special needs schools and independent sales organizations. The pilot programs generally last 2 to 4 months with a constant rotation of some pilots converting to commercial rollouts and new pilots coming in.
 
Designed for less chronic wanderers and as an introduction to our other footwear-based location monitoring products, in March 2015, we introduced the Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) SmartSoles, a footwear system designed to monitor when the wearer enters or leaves a room or building. The BLE SmartSoles were specifically designed based on the needs of assisted living facilities and indoor monitoring and tracking. Similar to the GPS SmartSole, the BLE SmartSole looks and feels like a regular insole, may be placed in most shoes and trimmed to fit. The BLE SmartSole is embedded with a miniaturized low energy Bluetooth chip that reports when the user crosses a virtual perimeter. The BLE SmartSole has a battery life of over one year, alleviating the caregiver from the worry of recharging or replacing batteries. The technology is customizable for personal home use or commercial assisted living facilities and the caregiver is alerted via email or text when the wearer leaves the area. Throughout 2016, we concentrated on B2B sales with this product line which was only offered to a limited number of distributors. In 2017, we plan to open up distribution of this product line and expand throughout our entire network of channel partners. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we commenced shipping SmartSoles to a distributor in Denmark and are actively pursuing certain other countries such as the UK, Sweden and Norway. We have also begun exploring adding more capabilities to our BLE line and incorporate other sensor technology.

GENERAL
 
We maintain several Internet websites, blogs and social media sites including; www.gtxcorp.com, www.locimobile.com, www.trackmyworkforce.co, www.gpssmartsole.com, www.codeamberalertag.com and www.gpstrackingapps.com. Our annual reports, quarterly reports, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and other information related to this Company, are available, free of charge, on our corporate website as soon as we electronically file those documents with, or otherwise furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s various Internet websites and the information contained therein, or connected thereto, are not, and are not intended, to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INVESTMENT
 
Since 2002, we have invested, and continue to invest, significantly in our intellectual property portfolio, which consist of patents, trademarks and URLs. We have an ongoing program to file additional applications for and to obtain patents in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Currently, we own 23 patents, many of which have priority dates going back to as early as 2002, with several in the footwear category and a majority covering other aspects of the personal locator technology. The IP also addresses our operating system and user interface. We also have several trademarks and acquired a license in 2011 for 62 external patents all in the field of geo – specific location based services.
THE INDUSTRY
 
It is now possible for a network of physical objects (humans, vehicles, buildings, infrastructure, equipment of all shapes and types) to collect and exchange data and to work together. This enables devices, sensors and systems to operate autonomously in pursuit of goals and objectives set by the human architects of the system. This has become known as The Internet of Things (IoT) and will drive radical change across multiple industries. While we all move towards an even more connected world, we believe that accurately identifying the location of a person or assets in real time will be a key driver in many wearable and IoT devices.
 
Smart technology is becoming the norm and it is starting to find its way into all parts of society. Miniature electronic devices that are worn by a person, commonly referred to as wearables, were a big and emerging part of the smart technology landscape for 2016 and is continuing on a strong upward trajectory in 2017. Wearable Technology is on the rise in personal fitness, wellness, healthcare and business use. CCS Insight recently updated its outlook on the future of wearable tech, indicating that 411 million smart wearable devices, worth a staggering $34 billion, will be sold in 2020.
 
The Caregiving Innovation Frontiers (CIF) study found that an estimated 117 million Americans will need assistance of some kind by 2020, but the number of unpaid caregivers is only expected to reach 45 million in the same year. We believe that these unpaid caregivers would benefit from solutions that assist them in locating and monitoring their elderly persons. This huge demand represents a $279 billion revenue opportunity over the next four years across six different business areas identified in the study, with 80% of spending being out-of-pocket costs. Technology solutions and remote health monitoring systems that enable family caregivers could provide key relief, according to the report. The CIF report outlined six areas for business opportunities, with huge potential for revenue grabs. Technology represents an opportunity across all the service areas, according to AARP. The majority of family caregivers—67% of them—want to use technology to monitor their loved one’s health and safety, but only about 10% are doing so right now, leaving a lot of room for growth.
 
In our ever-mobile society, it helps to know where we are and where we are going. Same with caregivers of seniors suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia, freight forwarding companies wanting to know where their packages are, and employers want to know where their field workers are. Many parents desire to have the ability to know where their children are and where they are going. Having such information is now possible with access to real-time information delivered on-demand through miniaturized, low power consumption locator systems and technologies such as ours.

The rising need for two-way GPS and location based services is influenced by several factors, among them:
 

● | Universal awareness and expanding penetration of GPS enabled mobile smartphones & tablets (estimated 2 billion shipments worldwide in 2015). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Personal and asset security concerns affecting a greater portion of the population. This includes the increased awareness related to Global Terrorism and unrest. 
● | Increasing numbers of elderly or memory impaired (Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism, etc. 9 million in U.S. and growing to 277 million worldwide by 2050). 
● | Corporations needing to manage worker productivity and logistics. 
● | Government agencies, law enforcement and military personnel monitoring. 
● | Massive life style adoption of Location Based Social Networking. 

GROWTH STRATEGY
 
We are engaged in a three-prong business model; business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C) and licensing of our technology to other companies. Our initial focus it to provide personal monitoring and asset location products and services within specific niche markets. Once we hit critical mass in pricing, we will expand into the mass consumer markets. The strategy is to establish licensing relationships with key industry partners who will embed our technology into their products to sell to their established customer base. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Providing our Personal Locator embedded module to licensees to empower their products with our two-way GPS tracking capabilities; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Providing B2B hardware leasing programs; 
● | OEM private label manufacturing; 
● | A mass market retail price under $149.00 for Personal Location devices; 
● | A monthly service fee structure, under $20.00, having multiple convenient access points (mobile phone, land line, or via the Internet); 
● | Reduction in hardware size and cost in order to open new markets such as kids; 
● | Continue expanding our medical reimbursement programs; 
● | Rolling out bio metrics and home health solutions; 
● | Expanding distribution into Asia; 
● | Increasing the number of solutions for the military and law enforcement markets, and; 
● | Ease of use at the location interface point as well as with the device, using state-of-the-art cloud computing and cloud application development. 

COMPETITION
 
Personal location and property tracking devices of various kinds are currently available from various vendors, and the number of competitive products is increasing rapidly in the marketplace. Furthermore, many of the location products and services are available at no cost to the user or are already included in other products. Nevertheless, we believe this rapidly growing market acceptance of the tracking solutions that we offer represents an opportunity as the intrinsic value of the tracking solutions is recognized and mass market adoption continues. The key competitive advantage for GTX in its lead SmartSole product is our innovative approach to embedding electronics inside a flexible footwear system, which advantage is protected by an extensive patent portfolio and first to market.
 
Key differentiators between ourselves and the competition is:
 
B2B:


● | Providing a comprehensive end-to-end solution comprised of hardware, software, and global connectivity, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The ability to strategically align ourselves with partners to embed our technology through OEM or private label programs. 

 
B2C:


● | Is that our BLE & GPS SmartSole is the only non-visible, non-intrusive solution.
