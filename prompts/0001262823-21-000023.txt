Item 1. Business
General
We are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. Our products include some of the most widely used materials in the world, which are fundamental to many diverse consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, water treatment, refrigerants, residential and commercial construction as well as other durable and non-durable goods. We operate in two principal operating segments, Vinyls and Olefins. We are highly integrated along our olefins product chain with significant downstream integration into polyethylene and styrene monomer. We are also a highly-integrated global producer of vinyls with substantial downstream integration into polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") building products.
We began operations in 1986 after our first polyethylene plant, an Olefins segment business, near Lake Charles, Louisiana was acquired from Occidental Petroleum Corporation. We began our vinyls operations in 1990 with the acquisition of a vinyl chloride monomer ("VCM") plant in Calvert City, Kentucky from The B.F.Goodrich Company. In 1992, we commenced our Vinyls segment's building products operations after acquiring three PVC pipe plants. Since 1986, we have grown rapidly into an integrated global producer of basic chemicals, vinyls, polymers and building products. We achieved this growth by acquiring existing plants or constructing new plants and completing numerous capacity or production line expansions. We regularly consider acquisitions and other internal and external growth opportunities that would be consistent with, or complementary to, our overall business strategy.
In 2014, we formed Westlake Chemical Partners LP ("Westlake Partners") to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. Also in 2014, Westlake Partners completed an initial public offering. As of February 17, 2021, Westlake Partners' assets consisted of a 22.8% limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP ("OpCo"), as well as the general partner interest in OpCo. Prior to the Westlake Partners IPO, OpCo's assets were wholly-owned by us. OpCo's assets include two ethylene production facilities at our olefins facility in Lake Charles, one ethylene production facility at our Calvert City site and a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu, Texas to the Longview, Texas site, which includes our Longview polyethylene production facility. We retain a 77.2% limited partner interest in OpCo, a 40.1% limited partner interest in Westlake Partners (consisting of 14,122,230 common units), a general partner interest in Westlake Partners and incentive distribution rights. The operations of Westlake Partners are consolidated in our financial statements. We are party to certain agreements with Westlake Partners and OpCo whereby, among other things, OpCo sells us 95% of the ethylene it produces on a cost-plus basis that is expected to generate a fixed margin per pound of $0.10. We use this ethylene in the production processes of both our Vinyls and Olefins segments. For more information, see "—Vinyls Business" and "—Olefins Business" below.
On January 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of NAKANTM, a global compounding solutions business. NAKAN's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries. With this acquisition, our compounding business now has facilities worldwide in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the United States and Vietnam, as well as a world-class research facility in France and several application laboratories. 
On November 12, 2019, we, through one of our subsidiaries, Eagle US 2 LLC ("Eagle"), completed the acquisition of an additional 34.8% of the membership interests in LACC, LLC ("LACC") from Lotte Chemical USA Corporation, a subsidiary of Lotte Chemical Corporation ("Lotte"), for approximately $817 million (the "Transaction"). Prior to the Transaction, Eagle owned approximately 12% of the membership interests in LACC. As of December 31, 2020, we owned an aggregate 46.8% membership interest in LACC. The LACC ethylene plant has 2.2 billion pounds per year of ethylene production capacity and is adjacent to our chlor-alkali facility in Lake Charles. During the third quarter of 2019, the LACC ethylene plant began commercial operations. As a result of the Transaction, we will receive our proportionate share of LACC's ethylene production on a cash-cost basis, which is expected to benefit our integrated downstream operations.
We benefit from highly integrated production facilities that allow us to process raw materials into higher-value-added chemicals and building products. As of February 17, 2021, we (directly and through OpCo, our investment in LACC, and our 95%- and 60%-owned joint ventures in China and Taiwan, respectively) had approximately 44.3 billion pounds per year of aggregate production capacity at numerous manufacturing sites in North America, Europe and Asia.
Vinyls Business
Products
Principal products in our integrated Vinyls segment include PVC, VCM, ethylene dichloride ("EDC"), chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) and chlorinated derivative products and, through OpCo and LACC, ethylene. We also manufacture and sell PVC compounds and building products fabricated primarily from PVC, including residential siding, trim and moldings; pipe and fittings for various water, sewer, electrical and industrial applications; profiles for windows and doors; decking; films for various inflatables, wallcovering, tape and roofing applications; and composite roof tiles. We manage our integrated Vinyls production chain, from the basic chemicals to finished building products, to optimize product margins and capacity utilization. Our primary North American chemical manufacturing facilities are located in our Calvert City, Kentucky and Lake Charles, Plaquemine and Geismar, Louisiana sites. Our Calvert City site includes an ethylene plant, which is owned by OpCo, a chlor-alkali plant, a VCM plant and a PVC plant. Our Lake Charles site includes three chlor-alkali plants, two VCM plants, a chlorinated derivative products plant and cogeneration assets. Our Plaquemine site includes a chlor-alkali plant, a VCM plant, a PVC plant and cogeneration assets. Our Geismar site includes a chlor-alkali plant, a VCM plant and a PVC plant. We also produce chlorine, caustic soda, hydrogen and chlorinated derivative products at our Natrium, West Virginia; Longview, Washington and Beauharnois, Quebec facilities and PVC resin at our facility in Aberdeen, Mississippi. Our European chemical manufacturing facilities are located in Germany and include two chlor-alkali plants, two VCM plants and four PVC plants. As of February 17, 2021, we had 37 building products and PVC compound plants in North America, Europe and Asia, most of which were owned by us. Our Asian vinyls chemical manufacturing facilities are located near Shanghai, in China, and in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, through our 95%- and 60%-owned joint ventures, respectively, and include a PVC plant, a PVC film and sheet plant, a chlor-alkali plant and a chlorinated derivative products plant.

PVC. PVC, the world's third most widely used plastic, is an attractive alternative to traditional materials such as glass, metal, wood, concrete and other plastic materials because of its versatility, durability and cost-competitiveness. PVC is produced from VCM, which is, in turn, made from chlorine and ethylene. PVC compounds are highly customized formulations that offer specific end-use properties based on customer-determined manufacturing specifications. PVC compounds are made by combining PVC resin with various additives in order to make either rigid and impact-resistant or soft and flexible compounds. The various compounds are then fabricated into end-products through extrusion, calendering, injection-molding or blow-molding. 
We are the second-largest PVC producer in the world. With the completion of our previously announced expansion projects at our Geismar and Burghausen plants in 2019, we have the capacity to produce approximately 6.8 billion pounds and 1.0 billion pounds of commodity and specialty PVC per year, respectively, at our various facilities globally. We use some of our PVC internally in the production of our building products and PVC compounds. The remainder of our PVC is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets.
VCM. VCM is used to produce PVC, solvents and PVC-related products. We use ethylene and chlorine to produce EDC, which is used in turn, to produce VCM. We have the capacity to produce approximately 6.3 billion pounds and 1.5 billion pounds of VCM per year at our North American and European facilities, respectively. The majority of our VCM is used internally in our PVC operations. VCM and EDC not used internally are sold externally.
Chlorine and Caustic Soda. We are the second-largest chlor-alkali producer in the world. We combine salt and electricity to produce chlorine and caustic soda, commonly referred to as chlor-alkali, at our Lake Charles, Plaquemine, Natrium, Calvert City, Geismar, Beauharnois, Longview (WA), Gendorf, Knapsack and Kaohsiung facilities. We use our chlorine production in our VCM and chlorinated derivative products plants. We currently have the capacity to supply all of our chlorine requirements internally. Any remaining chlorine is sold into the merchant chlorine market. Our caustic soda is sold to external customers who use it for, among other things, the production of pulp and paper, organic and inorganic chemicals and alumina.
Chlorinated Derivative Products. Our chlorinated derivative products include ethyl chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, tri-ethane® solvents, VersaTRANS® solvents, calcium hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid ("HCL") and pelletized caustic soda ("PELS"). We have the capacity to produce approximately 2.3 billion pounds of chlorinated derivative products per year, primarily at our Lake Charles, Natrium, Beauharnois and Longview (WA) facilities. The majority of our chlorinated derivative products are sold to external customers who use these products for, among other things, refrigerants, water treatment applications, chemicals and pharmaceutical production, food processing, steel pickling, solvent and cleaning chemicals and natural gas and oil production.
Ethylene. We utilize ethylene from OpCo's facility in Calvert City and LACC to produce VCM at our facilities. We obtain the remainder of the ethylene we need for our Vinyls business from third party purchases. The use of ethane feedstock by our ethylene plants enables us to enhance our low-cost vinyl chain integration. 
Building Products and PVC Compounds. Products made from PVC are used in materials ranging from water and sewer systems to home and commercial applications for siding, trim, mouldings, deck, window and door profiles. Our building products consist of two primary product groups: (i) exterior products, which includes siding, trim, mouldings, window profiles, decking products and roofing applications; and (ii) PVC pipe, specialty PVC pipe and fittings. We are the second-largest manufacturer of PVC pipe by capacity in North America. We manufacture and market exterior products under the Royal Building Products®, Celect Cellular Exteriors by Royal®, Zuri Premium Decking by Royal®, Royal S4S Trim Board®, Exterior Portfolio® and DaVinci® brand names. We manufacture and market specialty pipe and fittings, water, sewer, irrigation and conduit pipe products under the NAPCOTM brand name. We manufacture film and sheet at our Shanghai facility for both Asian and global markets. Flexible PVC compounds are used for wire and cable insulation, medical applications and packaging, flooring, wall coverings, automotive interior and exterior trims and packaging. Rigid extrusion PVC compounds are commonly used in window and door profiles, vertical blinds and construction products, including pipe and siding. Injection-molding PVC compounds are used in specialty products such as computer housings and keyboards, appliance parts and containers. Powder compounds are primarily used in window and door profiles and pipe and fittings. The combined capacity of our 37 building products and PVC compounds plants is approximately 3.5 billion pounds per year.
Electricity. Our Lake Charles, Plaquemine and Natrium cogeneration assets have the capacity to generate electricity of approximately 420, 240 and 100 megawatts, respectively, per year. Our North American joint ventures include a 50% interest in RS Cogen L.L.C. ("RS Cogen") that generates electricity, of which our share is approximately 212 megawatts.
Feedstocks 
We are highly integrated along our vinyls production chain. We (through OpCo) produce most of the ethylene required at our Calvert City and Lake Charles facilities utilizing ethane feedstock. The LACC ethylene facility is located adjacent to our vinyls facility in Lake Charles and has an ethylene production capacity of 2.2 billion pounds per year. During the third quarter of 2019, the LACC ethylene plant began its commercial operations. At December 31, 2020, we, through one of our subsidiaries, own 46.8% of the membership interests in LACC. We receive our proportionate share in ethylene production on a cash-cost basis and primarily use it to produce VCM. In Germany, we have access to, and partially own, an ethylene pipeline. The salt requirements for several of our larger chlor-alkali plants are supplied internally from salt domes we either own or lease and is transported by pipelines we own. We purchase the salt required for our other chlor-alkali plants pursuant to long-term contracts. Electricity and steam for one of our Lake Charles facilities are produced by both on-site cogeneration units and through a toll arrangement with RS Cogen, a joint venture in which we own a 50% interest. RS Cogen operates a process steam, natural gas-fired cogeneration facility adjacent to the site. Electricity and steam for the Plaquemine facility is supplied internally by our on-site cogeneration unit. A portion of our Natrium facility's electricity requirements is produced by our on-site generation unit, and the remainder is purchased. We purchase electricity for our remaining facilities under long-term contracts. We purchase VCM for our Asian PVC plant on a contract and spot basis. 
Our North American and Asian PVC facilities supply predominantly all of the PVC required for our building products plants. PVC required for the PVC compounds plants is either internally sourced or externally purchased at market prices based on the location of the plants. The remaining feedstocks include pigments, fillers, stabilizers and other ingredients, which we purchase under short-term contracts based on prevailing market prices.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have a dedicated sales force for our business, organized by product line and region. In addition, we rely on distributors to market products to smaller customers. We use some of our PVC internally in the production of our building products and PVC compounds. The remainder of our PVC is sold to downstream fabricators and the international markets. We have the capacity to use a majority of our chlorine internally to produce VCM and EDC, most of which, in turn, is used to produce PVC. We also use our chlorine internally to produce chlorinated derivative products. We sell the remainder of our chlorine and substantially all of our caustic soda production to external customers. The majority of our products are shipped from production facilities directly to the customer via pipeline, truck, rail, barge and/or ship. The remaining products are shipped from production facilities to third party chemical terminals and warehouses until being sold to customers.
We sell a majority of our siding, trim and mouldings products, PVC pipe, specialty PVC pipe and fittings, and film and sheet products through a combination of our internal sales force and manufacturer's representatives. In Canada, we operate 18 company-owned distribution branches that sell our vinyl siding and accessories and trim and mouldings products, as well as pipe and fittings. We also engage in advertising programs primarily directed at trade professionals that are intended to develop awareness and interest in our products. In addition, we display our building products at trade shows.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the Vinyls segment in 2020.

(3)We own the Lake Charles, Louisiana facility.
Ethylene. Ethylene is the world's most widely used petrochemical in terms of volume. It is the key building block used to produce a large number of higher value-added chemicals including polyethylene, EDC, VCM and styrene. OpCo has the capacity to produce approximately 3.0 billion pounds of ethylene per year at our olefins facility at our Lake Charles site, and we have the capability to consume all of OpCo's production that we purchase at Lake Charles to produce polyethylene and styrene monomer in our Olefins business. In addition, we (through OpCo) produce ethylene co-products including chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. We (through OpCo) sell our entire output of these co-products to external customers.
Polyethylene. Polyethylene, the world's most widely consumed polymer, is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of film, coatings and molded product applications primarily used in packaging. Polyethylene is generally classified as either LDPE, LLDPE or high-density polyethylene ("HDPE"). The density correlates to the relative stiffness of the end-use products. The difference between LDPE and LLDPE is molecular, and products produced from LLDPE, in general, have higher strength properties than products produced from LDPE. LDPE exhibits better clarity and other physical properties and is used in end products such as bread bags, food wraps, milk carton coatings and food packaging. LLDPE is used for higher film strength applications such as stretch film and heavy-duty sacks. HDPE is used to manufacture products such as grocery, merchandise and trash bags, rigid plastic containers, plastic closures and pipe.
We are the second-largest producer of LDPE by capacity in North America and predominantly use the autoclave technology (versus tubular technology), which is capable of producing higher-margin specialty polyethylene products. In 2020, our annual capacity of approximately 1.5 billion pounds was available in numerous formulations to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. We also have the capacity to produce approximately 1.1 billion pounds of LLDPE per year in various formulations. We produce LDPE and LLDPE at both the Lake Charles and Longview facilities. Our Lake Charles and Longview facilities also have the capability to produce HDPE. We sell polyethylene to external customers as a final product in pellet form. 
Styrene. Styrene is used to produce derivatives such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, unsaturated polyester and synthetic rubber. These derivatives are used in a number of applications including consumer disposables, food packaging, housewares, paints and coatings, building materials, tires and toys. We produce styrene at our Lake Charles plant, where we have the capacity to produce approximately 570 million pounds of styrene per year, all of which is sold to external customers.
Feedstocks
We are highly integrated along our olefins product chain. We (through OpCo) produce most of the ethylene required to produce our polyethylene and styrene. Ethylene can be produced from either petroleum liquid feedstocks, such as naphtha, condensates and gas oils, or from natural gas liquid feedstocks, such as ethane, propane and butane. Both of OpCo's Lake Charles ethylene plants use ethane as the primary feedstock. Pursuant to a feedstock supply agreement between us and OpCo, OpCo receives ethane feedstock at the olefins facility at our Lake Charles site through several pipelines from a variety of suppliers in Texas and Louisiana. We own a 50% interest in a 104-mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Mont Belvieu to our Lake Charles site. OpCo owns a 200-mile ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu to our Longview site.
In addition to ethylene supplied by OpCo and LACC, we also acquire ethylene from third parties in order to supply a portion of our Vinyls segment ethylene requirements. We acquire butene and hexene to manufacture polyethylene and benzene to manufacture styrene. We receive butene and hexene at the Lake Charles site and hexene at the Longview site via rail car from several suppliers. We receive benzene via barges, ships and pipeline pursuant to short-term arrangements. We purchase butene and hexene pursuant to multi-year contracts, some of which are renewable for an additional term subject to either party to the contract notifying the other party that it does not wish to renew the contract. We purchase electricity for our Lake Charles facility under long-term industrial contracts.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have an internal sales force that sells our products directly to our customers. Our polyethylene customers are some of the nation's largest producers of film and flexible packaging.
We and OpCo sell ethylene and ethylene co-products to external customers. OpCo's primary ethylene co-products are chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. We have storage agreements and exchange agreements that allow us and OpCo access to customers who are not directly connected to the pipeline system that we own. OpCo ships crude butadiene and pyrolysis gasoline by rail or truck. Additionally, we transport our polyethylene and styrene by rail or truck. Further, styrene can be transported by barge or ship.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales for the Olefins segment in 2020. 
Competition
The markets in which our Olefins business operates are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of customer service, product deliverability, quality, consistency, performance and price. Our competitors in the ethylene, polyethylene and styrene markets are some of the world's largest chemical companies, including Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, Dow Inc., ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Formosa Plastics Corporation, LyondellBasell Industries, N.V., NOVA Chemicals Corporation and Sasol Limited.
Environmental
As is common in our industry, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the countries in which we do business. National, state or provincial and local standards regulating air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations around the world. Compliance with such laws and regulations has required and will continue to require capital expenditures and increase operating costs.
It is our policy to comply with all environmental, health and safety requirements and to provide safe and environmentally sound workplaces for our employees. In some cases, compliance can be achieved only by incurring capital expenditures. In 2020, we made capital expenditures of $31 million related to environmental compliance. We estimate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $41 million in 2021 and $45 million in 2022, respectively, related to environmental compliance. The expected 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures are relatively higher than the amounts we have spent related to environmental compliance in recent years in large part due to capital expenditures related to previously existing and new Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") regulations and corrective actions required by the EPA to resolve the flare enforcement matter discussed below. The remainder of the 2021 and 2022 estimated expenditures are related to equipment replacement and upgrades. We anticipate that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in general. Although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures, management believes that our current spending trends will continue.
From time to time, we receive notices or inquiries from government entities regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal, emission and storage of chemical substances, including hazardous wastes. Pursuant to Item 103 of the SEC's Regulation S-K, the following environmental matters involve a governmental authority as a party to the proceedings and potential monetary sanctions that we believe could exceed $1 million (which is less than one percent of our current assets on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2020): 
•For several years, the EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. On April 21, 2014, we received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request from the EPA which sought information regarding flares at the Calvert City facility and certain Lake Charles facilities. The EPA has informed us that the information provided leads the EPA to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. The EPA has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate us to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. We believe the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $1 million.
We do not believe that the resolution of these flare matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Also see our discussion of our environmental matters contained in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" below, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" below and Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Human Capital
Headcount
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,220 employees in the following areas: 

Category | Number
Vinyls segment | 8,060 
Olefins segment | 820 
Corporate and other | 340 

Our employees are distributed across 16 countries. Approximately 38% of our employees are represented by labor unions, and all of these union employees are working under collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times through 2024. We have multiple collective bargaining agreements in Europe, North America and Asia, covering different groups of our work force. There were no strikes, lockouts or work stoppages in 2020, and we believe that our relationship with our employees and unions is open and positive.
Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in manufacturing, marketing, sales, and other positions is crucial to executing our strategy. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, career opportunities and work environment.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. Our health and safety programs are designed around global standards with appropriate variations addressing the multiple jurisdictions and regulations, specific hazards and unique working environments of our manufacturing and administrative office locations. We require each of our locations to perform regular safety audits to ensure proper safety policies, program procedures, analyses and training are in place.
Several of our U.S. manufacturing sites have been recognized by the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration's ("OSHA") Voluntary Protection Program ("VPP") for their low injury rates, employee engagement and safety programs. All of our chemical sites in Germany satisfy the Deutsche Industrie Norm ISO 45001 certification program, which is comparable to VPP. We strive to be in the top quartile of relevant rankings of recordable incident rates in all countries in which we operate.
Technology 
Historically, our technology strategy has been to selectively acquire licenses from third-parties, as well as develop our own proprietary technology. Our selection process incorporates many factors, including the cost of the technology, the ability to meet our customers' requirements, raw material and energy consumption rates, product quality, capital costs, maintenance requirements and reliability. Most of the technology licensed from third-party providers is perpetual and has been paid in full. We own an intellectual property portfolio developed from focused research in both process and product technology. After acquiring or developing a technology, we devote considerable effort to effectively employ the technology and further its development, with a focus towards continuous improvement of our competitive positions.
Conversely, we have selectively granted licenses to our patented Energx® technology for LLDPE production and for proprietary LDPE reactor mixing technology. We have also granted several licenses for EDC/VCM technology, including the direct chlorination process and catalyst, and S-PVC (Suspension PVC for thermoplastic process) process and technology.
