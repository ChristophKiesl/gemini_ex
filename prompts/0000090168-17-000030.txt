Item 1. Business

A. | The Company

SIFCO Industries, Inc. ("SIFCO," "Company," "we" or "our"), an Ohio corporation, was incorporated in 1916. The executive offices of the Company are located at 970 East 64th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44103, and its telephone number is (216) 881-8600.
SIFCO Industries, Inc. is engaged in the production of forgings and machined components primarily for the Aerospace and Energy ("A&E") markets. The processes and services include forging, heat-treating and machining. The Company's operations are conducted in a single business segment. Information relating to the Company's financial results is set forth in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. 

B. | Principal Products and Services

1. SIFCO
Operations
SIFCO is a manufacturer of forgings for the A&E markets. We provide our customers with envelope and precision forgings, rough, and machined components, as well as sub-assemblies. SIFCO services both original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") and aftermarket customers with products that range in size from approximately 2 to 1,200 pounds. The Company's strategic vision is to build a leading A&E company positioned for long-term, stable growth and profitability. 
SIFCO's strategic vision is to have a revenue balance comprised of military, commercial aerospace, and power generation. In fiscal 2017, commercial and military revenues accounted for 59.9% and 40.1% of revenues, respectively, compared with 60.9% in commercial revenues and 39.1% in military revenues in fiscal 2016. The Company has also expanded its capabilities to be a supplier of forged and machined components, consisting primarily of aluminum, steel, high temperature alloys and titanium.
SIFCO operates from multiple locations. SIFCO manufacturing facilities are located in Cleveland, Ohio ("Cleveland"); Alliance, Ohio ("Alliance"); Orange, California ("Orange"); and Maniago, Italy ("Maniago"). The Company closed Alliance in October 2017. 
The Company's success is not dependent on patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises.
SIFCO generally has multiple sources for its raw materials, which consist primarily of high quality metals essential to its business. Suppliers of such materials are located principally in North America and Europe. SIFCO generally does not depend on a single source for the supply of its materials. Due to the limited supply of certain raw materials, some material is provided by a small number of suppliers; however, SIFCO believes that its sources are adequate for its business. SIFCO's operations are AS 9100C and/or ISO 9001:2000 certified and the Company also holds multiple NADCAP certifications and site approvals from key OEM customers.
Products
SIFCO’s products are made primarily of steel, stainless steel, nickel alloy, titanium and aluminum and SIFCO's product offerings include: OEM and aftermarket components for aircraft and industrial gas turbine engines; steam turbine blades; structural airframe components; aircraft landing gear components; aircraft wheels and brakes; critical rotating components for helicopters; and commercial/industrial products. SIFCO also provides heat-treatment, surface-treatment, non-destructive testing and select machining and sub-assembly of forged components.
Industry
The performance of the domestic and international air transport industry and the energy industry, as well as government defense spending, directly and significantly impacts the performance of SIFCO.

• | SIFCO supplies new and spare components for commercial aircraft, principally for large aircraft produced by Boeing and Airbus. A continued increase in passenger travel demand will drive backlog for new aircraft. Demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft, particularly the Boeing 737Max, 787, 777X and the Airbus A320/A321neo and A350, remains strong with both companies reporting healthy backlogs.

• | SIFCO also supplies new and spare components to the U.S. military for aircraft, helicopters, vehicles, and munitions. While the defense budget in the United States has decreased in recent years, certain programs in which the Company participates has been favorable and are expected to continue to increase. 


• | SIFCO supplies new and spare components to the energy industry, particularly the industrial gas and steam turbine markets. The industrial gas and steam turbine markets have experienced a downturn in demand for new units in the near term. The overall market is forecasting to be flat to potentially down due to green technology alternatives gaining greater market share. SIFCO has positioned itself to support OEM production in a more limited role, but with flexibility to address the demand cycle in this segment as well as continuing to support the aftermarket. 

Competition
SIFCO competes with numerous companies, approximately fifteen of which are known by SIFCO, and some of which are non-U.S. based companies.  Many of these companies focus within the A&E markets. While there has been some consolidation in the forging industry, SIFCO believes there is limited opportunity to increase prices, other than for the pass-through of raw material price increases and value added services. SIFCO believes that it has an advantage in the primary markets it serves due to: (i) demonstrated A&E expertise; (ii) focusing on quality and customer service; (iii) operating initiatives such as SMART (Streamlined Manufacturing Activities to Reduce Time/Cost) and Six Sigma; and (iv) offering a broad range of capabilities. SIFCO competes with both U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers of forgings, some of which are significantly larger than SIFCO. As customers establish new facilities throughout the world, SIFCO will continue to encounter non-U.S. competition. SIFCO believes it can expand its markets by (i) acquiring additional forging and machining operations; (ii) broadening its product lines through investment in equipment that expands its manufacturing capabilities; and (iii) developing new customers in markets where the participants require similar technical competence and service as those in the A&E industries and who are willing to pay a premium for quality and service.
Customers
During fiscal 2017, SIFCO had three customers, consisting of various business units of Boeing, United Technologies Corporation and Siemens, which accounted for 13%, 11% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. The net sales to these three customers, and to their direct subcontractors, accounted for 35% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017. SIFCO believes that the loss of sales to such customers would result in a material adverse impact on the business. However, SIFCO has maintained a business relationship with these customers for many years and is currently conducting business with them under multi-year agreements. Although there is no assurance that this will continue, historically, as one or more major customers have reduced their purchases, SIFCO has generally been successful in gaining new business, thereby avoiding a material adverse impact on the Company. SIFCO relies on its ability to adapt its services and operations to changing requirements of the market in general and its customers in particular. No material part of SIFCO’s business is seasonal. For additional financial information about geographic areas, refer to Note 10, Business Information, of the consolidated financial statements.
Backlog of Orders
SIFCO’s total backlog as of September 30, 2017 decreased to $76.0 million, compared with $92.5 million as of September 30, 2016. Orders for delivery scheduled within the upcoming fiscal year decreased to $70.4 million compared with $84.3 million scheduled in fiscal 2017. Orders may be subject to modification or cancellation by the customer with limited charges. The decrease in total backlog as of September 30, 2017 compared with the previous year is primarily attributable to loss of sales from the closure of Alliance (completed in October 2017) and timing of long-term agreement negotiations. Backlog information may not be indicative of future sales.

C. | Environmental Regulations

The Company is required to comply with various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The costs of such compliance have not had, and are not presently expected to have, a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company and its subsidiaries under existing regulations and interpretations.

D. | Employees

The number of SIFCO employees decreased from approximately 607 at the beginning of fiscal 2017 to approximately 491 employees at the end of fiscal 2017. The decrease in employee headcount is due to both the closure of Alliance and headcount rationalizations at Cleveland, Orange and Maniago. The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with certain employees located at the Cleveland (expires in May 2020) and Alliance (agreement ceased on October 26, 2017 due to closure of Alliance) plants. The Maniago location is party to the National Collective Agreement in metal working (expires in December 2019).
