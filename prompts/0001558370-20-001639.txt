 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 General
 FTS International, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “our”) was originally formed in 2000. We are one of the largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services in North America. We have 1.4 million total hydraulic horsepower across 28 fleets, with 16 fleets active as of December 31, 2019. Our significant customers have included Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Ascent Resources Utica Holdings, LLC, Centennial Resource Development, Inc., COG Operating LLC, Devon Energy Corporation, Diamondback Energy, Inc., EOG Resources, Inc., EQT Corporation, and other leading oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies in North America. 
 We operate in five of the most active basins in the United States: the Permian Basin, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Marcellus/Utica Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Haynesville Shale. 
 We manufacture many of the components used by our fleets, including fabrication of pumps and consumables used in pumps, such as fluid-ends, valves, and seats. We perform substantially all the maintenance, repair and refurbishment of our fleets, including the rebuilding of engines and transmissions. We believe the cost to manufacture components and refurbish fleets is significantly less than the cost of utilizing third-party suppliers. In addition, we believe our in-house manufacturing capabilities allow us to reactivate equipment quicker and at a lower cost than utilizing third-party suppliers.
 We have a uniform fleet of high-horsepower hydraulic fracturing equipment, designed for completions work in areas requiring high levels of pressure, flow rate and sand intensity. We designed and assembled all of our existing fleets using internal resources. The standardized, “plug and play” nature of our fleet provides us with several advantages, including: reduced repair and maintenance costs; reduced inventory costs; the ability to redeploy equipment among operating basins; and reduced complexity in our operations, which improves our safety and operational performance.
 Our Services
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Our primary business is providing hydraulic fracturing services, also known as pressure pumping, to E&P companies. These services enhance hydrocarbon flow in oil and natural gas wells, thus increasing the amount of hydrocarbons recovered.
 Oil and natural gas wells are typically divided into one or more “stages,” which are isolated zones that focus the high-pressure fluid and proppant from the hydraulic fracturing fleet into distinct portions of the well and surrounding reservoir. The number of stages that will divide a well is determined by the customer’s proposed job design. Our customers typically measure our operational performance in terms of the number of stages fractured and how well we minimize non-productive time on our jobs. As a result, we believe the average number of stages completed per active fleet in a given period of time is an important operating metric. During the last three years, we have been able to increase our average stages per active fleet to achieve record levels in 2017, 2018, and again in 2019. Our ability, with the help and focus of our customers, has allowed us to reduce the non-productive time of our equipment, which has allowed us to complete more stages per fleet.
 Hydraulic fracturing represents the largest cost of completing an oil or natural gas well. The process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well casing or tubing at sufficient pressure to fracture, or prop open, the formation. The fracturing fluid consists of water and sand, also known as proppant, mixed with a small amount of chemicals. Once the pressure opens the fractures, the proppants act as a wedge that keep the fractures open, allowing the trapped hydrocarbons to flow more freely. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well, and we are not involved in that process or in the disposal of the fluid. As a result of a successful fracturing process, hydrocarbon recovery rates are substantially enhanced, increasing the return on investment for our

customer. The amount of hydrocarbons produced from a typical oil or natural gas well generally declines quickly. As a result, E&P companies must continually complete new wells to maintain production levels.
 Each of our fleets typically consists of approximately 20 hydraulic fracturing units along with ancillary equipment. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of a high-pressure pump, a diesel or combined diesel and natural gas engine, a transmission and various other supporting equipment mounted on a trailer. The high pressure pump consists of two key assemblies: the fluid-end and the power-end. Although the power-end of our pumps generally lasts several years, the fluid-end, which is the part of the pump through which the fracturing fluid is expelled under high pressure, is a shorter-lasting consumable, typically lasting less than one year. We refer to the group of hydraulic fracturing units, auxiliary equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a “fleet” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.” Our fleets operate primarily on a 24-hour-per-day basis, in which we typically staff three crews per fleet, including one crew with the day off.
 Each hydraulic fracturing fleet includes a mobile, on-site control center that monitors job data including pressures, rates and volumes. Each control center is equipped with high bandwidth satellite hardware that provides continuous upload and download of data. The data is delivered on a real-time basis to on-site job personnel, the customer and our National Operations Center.
 We prefer to enter into service agreements with our customers for one or more “dedicated” fleets, rather than providing our fleets for “spot work.” Under a typical dedicated fleet agreement, we deploy one or more of our hydraulic fracturing fleets exclusively to the customer to follow the customer’s completion schedule until the agreement expires or is terminated in accordance with its terms. By contrast, under a typical spot work agreement, the fleet moves between customers as work becomes available. We believe that our strategy of pursuing dedicated fleet agreements leads to higher fleet utilization, as measured by the number of days each fleet is working per month, which we believe reduces our month-to-month revenue volatility and improves our revenue and profitability. See Note 2 — “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our revenue recognition and pricing under our service agreements.
 Wireline Services
 In May 2019, we discontinued our wireline operations due to financial underperformance resulting from market conditions. Our wireline services primarily consisted of setting plugs between hydraulic fracturing stages, creating perforations within hydraulic fracturing stages and logging the characteristics of resource formations. Other
 We previously owned a 45% interest in SinoFTS, which is a Chinese joint venture that we formed in June 2014 with Sinopec Oilfield Service Corporation (“Sinopec”) to provide hydraulic fracturing services in China. In August 2019, FTSI closed on the sale of our ownership interest in SinoFTS to Sinopec. In exchange, we received consideration of $26.9 million for the sale of our equity interest and received a royalty fee of $5.8 million for a license for our intellectual property and for future limited technical support of the joint venture’s operations.Our Strategy 
 Our primary business objective is to deliver best in class pressure pumping services to our customers while providing a safe working environment for our employees and maintaining a competitive cost structure. We intend to achieve this objective through the following strategies:
 Deepen and expand relationships with customers that value our completions efficiency
 We prefer to dedicate one or more of our fleets exclusively to the customer for a period of time, allowing for those fleets to be integrated into the customer’s drilling and completion schedule. As a result, we are able to achieve higher levels of utilization, as measured by the number of days each fleet is working per month, which increases our profitability. Accordingly, we seek to partner with customers that have a large number of wells needing completion and 

 
 

 2
 
that value efficiency in the performance of our service. Specifically, we target customers whose completions activity typically involves minimal time between stages, a high number of stages per well, multiple wells per pad and a short distance from one well pad site to the next. This strategy aligns with the strategy of many of our customers, who are trying to achieve a manufacturing-style model of drilling and completing wells at a competitive cost. We plan to leverage this strategy to expand our relationships with our existing and prospective customers.
 Capitalize on our uniform fleet and in-house manufacturing to provide superior performance with reduced operating costs
 Our uniform fleet allows us to cost-effectively redeploy fleets to capture the best pricing and activity trends. The uniform fleet is easier to operate and maintain, resulting in reduced non-productive time as well as lower training costs and inventory stocking requirements.
 Our in-house manufacturing allows us to maintain and refurbish our fleets, with lower operating expenses and capital expenditures compared to utilizing third-party suppliers. We also believe this capability allows us to reactivate equipment quicker and at a lower cost than competitors, which we believe at times is a competitive advantage.
 Maintain high safety standards
 Safety is at the core of our operations and defines who we are and how we operate as a company. Our safety record for 2019 was the best in our history and we believe significantly better than our peer group, based on data provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2011 through 2018. For the past three years, we believe our total recordable incident rate was less than one third of the industry average. We believe continually searching for ways to make our operations safer is the right thing to do for our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and our Company.
 Rapidly adopt new technologies in a capital efficient manner
 Our large scale and culture of innovation allow us to take advantage of leading technological solutions. We have been a fast adopter of new technologies focused on: increasing fracturing effectiveness for our customers, reducing non-productive time on our equipment, reducing the operating costs of our equipment, and enhancing the health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) conditions at our well sites. 
 Recent examples of initiatives aimed at reducing our operating costs include: vibration sensors with predictive maintenance analytics on our equipment; automated greasing systems; remote start capabilities; the ability to automate certain portions of our operations; and adoption of hardened alloys for our consumables. Recent examples of initiatives aimed at improving our HSE conditions include: dual fuel engines that can run on both natural gas and diesel fuel; electronic pressure relief systems; spill prevention and containment solutions; electronic logging devices; containerized proppant delivery solutions; and advanced fire suppression systems.
 Maintain a focus on cost effectiveness and capital efficiency
 All levels of our organization focus on providing the safest work environment for our employees and on generating the highest level of cash generation as possible, within the limitations of industry conditions.
 We focus on operating our equipment at the highest level of efficiency to maximize billing activity for each of our fleets, which is often measured in terms of stages completed per active fleet. In turn, we strive to charge a competitive rate to our customers and to be compensated for the high level of efficiency that we provide. This ultimately leads to lower costs for our customers.
 In addition, we embrace innovation to continually find ways to lower the costs of doing business. This is enabled by our culture and our in-house manufacturing capabilities, which allow us to continuously identify and execute improvements in the design and operation of our equipment.

 Reduce debt and achieve a more conservative capital structure
 To improve our financial flexibility, we have been focused on reducing our debt and maintaining more than sufficient liquidity. We believe that we are able to not only make the investments necessary to remain a market leader in hydraulic fracturing, but also to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. 
 Customers
 The customers we serve are primarily large, independent E&P companies in North America. The following table shows the customers that represented more than 10% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The loss of any of our largest existing customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While we view revenue as an important metric in assessing customer concentration, we also compare and manage our customer portfolio based on the number of fleets we place with each customer.
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Diamondback E&P LLC | 16 | % | * | % | * | %
Ascent Resources | 10 | % | * | % | * | %
EQT Production Company | * | % | 12 | % | * | %
Devon Energy Corporation | * | % | 12 | % | * | %


 *Less than 10%.
 Suppliers
 We purchase parts used in the refurbishment, repair and manufacturing of major fleet components such as fluid-ends, power-ends, engines, transmissions, radiators and trailers. We do not expect significant interruptions in the supply of any of these materials. While we believe that we will be able to make alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these items, there can be no assurance that there will be no associated price or supply issues.
 When requested by the customer, we also purchase the proppants and chemicals we use in our operations and the diesel fuel for our equipment from a variety of suppliers throughout the United States. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis at competitive prices. In the past, we have experienced some delays in obtaining these materials during periods of high demand. We have a long-term supply agreement with one vendor to supply a significant portion of the proppant we procure until 2024. This agreement contains a fixed volume of purchases at market-based variable pricing with minimum unconditional purchase obligations.
 Competition
 The market in which we operate is highly competitive and highly fragmented. Our competition includes multi-national oilfield service companies as well as national and regional competitors. Our major multi-national competitors are Halliburton Company and Schlumberger Limited, each of which has significantly greater financial resources than we do. Our major domestic competitors are NextTier Oilfield Solutions, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corp, Liberty Oilfield Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., and BJ Services, Inc. Certain of these competitors provide a number of oilfield services and products in addition to hydraulic fracturing. We also face competition from smaller regional service providers in some of the geographies in which we operate.
 Competition in our industry is based on a number of factors, including price, service quality, safety, and in some cases, breadth of products. We believe we consistently deliver exceptional service quality, based in part on the durability of our equipment. Our durable equipment reduces non-productive time due to equipment failure and allows our customers to avoid costs associated with delays in completing their wells. By being able to meet the most demanding pressure and flow rate requirements, our equipment also enables us to operate efficiently in challenging geological environments in which some of our competitors cannot operate effectively.

 Cyclical Nature of Industry 
 We operate in a highly cyclical industry driven mainly by the level of horizontal drilling activity in the United States, which in turn depends largely on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production decline rates. A critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the supply and demand for both oil and natural gas. Demand for oil and natural gas is subject to large and rapid fluctuations. These fluctuations are driven by commodity demand in the industry and corresponding price increases. When oil and natural gas prices increase, producers generally increase their capital expenditures, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies. However, increased capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production, which historically, has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices that, in turn, tend to reduce demand for oilfield services such as hydraulic fracturing services. 
 The pricing for our services is also driven by the industry capacity of hydraulic fracturing equipment. Historically, the industry has built additional equipment to supply the increased demand. When the demand declines, the industry has more equipment than what is needed by customers. This often leads to a decline in the price for our services until equipment is de-activated and the supply and demand fundamentals are closer to balanced.
 For these reasons, our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations.
 Seasonality
 Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations. However, toward the end of some years, we experience slower activity in our pressure pumping operations in connection with the holidays and as customers’ capital expenditure budgets are depleted. Similarly, the beginning of some years have a slow start as customers are starting a new capital budget cycle and our operations are more prone to experience winter weather. Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions that cause disruption to our supply chain or our ability to transport materials and equipment to the job site. Employees
 At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,250 total employees, all of whom were full-time. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, nor are they members of labor unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Insurance
 Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires, oil spills and hazardous materials spills. These conditions can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment, the environment and wildlife and interruption or suspension of operations, among other adverse effects. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in our being named as a defendant to a lawsuit asserting significant claims.
 Despite our high safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and we anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, as well as our relationships with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance and could have other adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
 We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations, and we are partially self-insured for certain claims, in types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for our industry. These coverages and retentions address certain risks relating to commercial general liability, workers’ compensation, business auto, property 

 
 

 5
 
and equipment, directors and officers, environment, pollution and other risks. Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in our industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk.
 Safety and Health Regulation
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which is administered and enforced by OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information about the identities and hazards of the chemicals used or produced in operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, labeling requirements, training requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. OSHA continues to evaluate worker safety and to propose new regulations, such as but not limited to, Respirable Crystalline Silica Standard, which requires hydraulic fracturing operations in the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls to limit exposure to respirable silica sand by June 23, 2021. Although it is not possible to estimate the financial and compliance impact of this rule or any other proposed rule, the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Intellectual Property Rights
 Our research and development efforts are focused on providing specific solutions to the challenges our customers face when fracturing and stimulating wells. In addition to the design and manufacture of innovative equipment, we have also developed proprietary blends of chemicals that we use in connection with our hydraulic fracturing services. We have three U.S. patents and two patents in Canada relating to fracturing methods, the technology used in fluid-ends, hydraulic pumps and other equipment. We believe the information regarding our customer and supplier relationships are also valuable proprietary assets. We have registered trademarks and pending trademark applications for various names under which our entities do or intend to conduct business and offer products. Except for the foregoing, we do not own or license any patents, trademarks or other intellectual property that we believe to be material to the success of our business. Environmental Regulation
 Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, natural resources, clean air, drinking water, wetlands and endangered species, as well as chemical use and storage, waste management, and transportation of hazardous and non-hazardous materials. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may impose strict liability, joint and several liability or both for environmental contamination. Strict liability means we could be liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault. Strict adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Hydraulic Fracturing Activities. Certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report, entitled “Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States,” on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The report states that the EPA found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing

fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The report does not make any policy recommendations. Ongoing or proposed studies like these could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) or other regulatory mechanisms. For example, on November 29, 2018, EPA and the State Review of Oil and Natural Gas Environmental Regulation (“STRONGER”) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding pursuant to which EPA and STRONGER will collaborate on oil and natural gas exploration and development regulatory programs.
 At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the Railroad Commission of Texas issued a “well integrity rule,” which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. The well integrity rule took effect in January 2014. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Some states, counties and municipalities are closely examining water-use issues, such as permit and disposal options for processed water. If new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. See “Risk Factors—Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays” in Item 1A of this annual report.
 Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund law,” and comparable state laws generally impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the conduct at the time it occurred, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time a release of hazardous substances occurred and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances to an offsite facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed “potentially responsible parties” are subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of investigating, monitoring, removing and remediating previously released hazardous substances (including hazardous substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
 Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations issued thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a final report which identified discharge of inadequately treated hydraulic fracturing wastewater to surface water resources as having potential to impact drinking water resources. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water, which require covered facilities to obtain permits, maintain storm water plans and implement practices to minimize risks related to storm water.
 These laws and regulations also prohibit certain other activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which we refer to as the “Corps.” In September 2015, a new rule became effective which was issued by the EPA and the Corps defining the scope of the jurisdiction of the EPA and the Corps over wetlands and other waters of the United States. After being challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expanded the reach of Clean Water Act’s programs, on December 11, 2018, EPA proposed a rule that would revise the 

 
 

 7
 
definition of “Waters of the United States” and clarify the scope of federal authority under the Clean Water Act. On September 12, 2019, EPA and the Corps announced the repeal of the 2015 rule and the recodification of the regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 rule until the proposed rule was finalized (the “Step One Rule”). On January 23, 2020, the EPA and Corps did, in fact, finalize the Navigable Waters Protection Rule to define “Waters of the United States”, a rule that streamlines the definition of “Wates of the United States” that are federally regulated under the Clean Water Act to four categories. This rule will become effective and replace the Step One Rule sixty days after publication in the Federal Register. The rapidly changing landscape of federal regulation creates uncertainty in our and our customers’ business. Under the Clean Water Act, we are also subject to Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plan requirements that require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations.
 Waste Handling. Wastes from certain of our operations (such as equipment maintenance and past chemical development, blending, and distribution operations) are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain oil production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions. In the EPA’s 2016“Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States” report, the EPA identified disposal or storage of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in unlined pits as resulting in contamination of groundwater resources.
 Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous.” Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
 From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own, owned previously or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws. Under such laws and related regulations, we have been and may be required to investigate, remove or remediate these materials or wastes and make expenditures associated with personal injury or property damage. At this time, with respect to any properties where materials or wastes may have been released, but of which we have not been made aware, it is not possible to estimate the potential costs that may arise from unknown, latent liability risks.
 Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants, including through the issuance of permits. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants from specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We are required to obtain air permits in connection with some activities under applicable laws. These permits impose certain conditions and restrictions on our operations, some of which require significant expenditures for compliance. Changes in these requirements, or in the permits we operate under, could increase our costs or limit operations.
 Additionally, the EPA’s Tier IV regulations apply to certain off-road diesel engines used by us to power equipment in the field. Under these regulations, we are required to retrofit or retire certain engines and we are limited in the number of non-compliant off-road diesel engines we can purchase. Tier IV engines are costlier, and until Tier IV-

 
 

 8
 
compliant engines that meet our needs are more widely available, these regulations could limit our ability to acquire a sufficient number of diesel engines to expand our fleet and to replace existing engines as they are taken out of service.
 Other Environmental Considerations. E&P activities on federal lands may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, also known as NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. E&P activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
 Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Clean Water Act and CERCLA. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to habitat, jurisdictional waters or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or private parties may act to prevent oil and natural gas exploration activities. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Government entities may require permits and may also seek damages for harm to species, habitat, or natural resources or resulting from filling of jurisdictional streams or wetlands or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials.
 The Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) has established regulations to govern hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. In 2016, BLM published the Methane and Waste Reduction Rule to reduce the loss of natural gas through venting, flaring and leaks and reduce air pollution, including greenhouse gases, for oil and natural gas produced on federal and Indian lands. Following a series of legal challenges to the attempts to delay implementation of portions of the 2016 rule throughout 2017 and 2018, on September 28, 2018, BLM published a final rule revising the  Methane and Waste Reduction Rule, which became effective on November 27, 2018. These revisions rescinded a number of the 2016 waste prevention requirements. California and New Mexico, along with a coalition of environmental groups, filed suits challenging the 2018 final rule, and such litigation is ongoing. At this point, we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty.
 The Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), requires manufacturers of new chemical substances to provide specific information to the Agency for review prior to manufacturing chemicals or introducing them into commerce. EPA has permitted manufacture of new chemical nanoscale materials through the use of consent orders or Significant New Use Rules under TSCA. The Agency has also allowed the manufacture of new chemical nanoscale materials under the terms of certain regulatory exemptions where exposures were controlled to protect against unreasonable risks. On May 19, 2014, the EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to obtain data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. The EPA has not yet proceeded with the rulemaking but may do so in the future. Any changes in TSCA regulations could increase our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
 Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. The EPA later adopted two sets of related rules, one of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions from certain large stationary sources of emissions. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in July 2010, limits emissions from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule, which we refer to as the tailoring rule, in May 2010, and it became effective January 2011. The tailoring rule established new emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their greenhouse gas emissions and invalidated the tailoring rule. However, the Court ruled that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued two memoranda providing

guidance on greenhouse gas permitting requirements in response to the Supreme Court’s decision. In its preliminary guidance, the EPA stated that it would undertake a rulemaking action to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted “no action assurance” indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to greenhouse gases in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit. On April 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind PSD permits issued under the invalid regulations. In October 2015, the EPA amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of emissions from oil wells using hydraulic fracturing. Because of this continued regulatory focus, future greenhouse gas emission regulations of the oil and natural gas industry remain a possibility, which could increase the cost of our operations.
 In addition, the U.S. Congress occasionally attempts to adopt legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and many states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories, carbon pricing policies or regional cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not yet adopted such legislation, it may do so in the future. Several states continue to pursue related regulations as well. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Paris Agreement, which came into force on November 4, 2016, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although the Trump Administration has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement, many state and local officials have publicly stated they intend to abide by the terms of the Paris Agreement. Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our services. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our customers’ business and consequently our own.
 In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal or state common law. Private parties, as well as local governments, have also filed lawsuits against certain energy companies seeking compensation for climate change related damages, including personal injury or property damages. Future climate change litigation could increase our operating costs or negatively impact demand for our services.
 NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and natural gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM.
 Pollution Risk Management. We seek to minimize the possibility of a pollution event through equipment and job design, as well as through employee training. We also maintain a pollution risk management program if a pollution event occurs. This program includes an internal emergency response plan that provides specific procedures for our employees to follow in the event of a chemical or hazardous substance release or spill. In addition, we have contracted with several third-party emergency responders in our various operating areas that are available on a 24-hour basis to handle the remediation and clean-up of any chemical or hazardous substance release or spill. We carry insurance designed to respond to foreseeable environmental exposures. This insurance portfolio has been structured in an effort to address incidents that result in bodily injury or property damage and any ensuing investigation and clean up needed at our owned and leased facilities as a result of the mobilization and utilization of our fleet, as well as any claims resulting from our operations.
 We also seek to manage environmental liability risks through provisions in our contracts with our customers that allocate risks relating to surface activities associated with the fracturing process, other than water disposal, to us and

risks relating to “downhole” liabilities to our customers. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water. The customers remove the water from the well using a controlled flow-back process, and we are not involved in that process or the disposal of the fluid. Our contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us against pollution and environmental damages originating below the surface of the ground or arising out of water disposal, or otherwise caused by the customer, other contractors or other third parties. In turn, we indemnify our customers for pollution and environmental damages originating at or above the surface caused solely by us. We seek to maintain consistent risk-allocation and indemnification provisions in our customer agreements to the greatest extent possible. Some of our contracts, however, contain less explicit indemnification provisions, which typically provide that each party will indemnify the other against liabilities to third parties resulting from the indemnifying party’s actions, except to the extent such liability results from the indemnified party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional act.
