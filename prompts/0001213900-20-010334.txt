Business Strategy and Objectives
 
Our automated online health directory was intended to allow customers to advertise through the Company’s website while keeping track of all sales generated through our directory. 
CURRENT PLAN OF OPERATION
 
We have been dormant since September 2013. As of the date of this Report, we intend to engage in what we believe to be synergistic acquisitions or joint ventures with a company or companies that we believe will enhance our business plan. There are no assurances we will be able to consummate any acquisitions using our securities as consideration, or at all. Numerous things will need to occur to allow us to implement this aspect of our business plan and there are no assurances that any of these developments will occur, or if they do occur, that we will be successful in fully implementing our plan.
 
Management will seek out and evaluate businesses for acquisition. The integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with management’s standards. Once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate, we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation, including its financial statements, cash flow, debt, location and other material aspects of the candidate’s business. If we are successful in our attempts to acquire a company or companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid, our current shareholders will incur dilution.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, asset purchase, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, likely, our present interim management and shareholders will no longer be in control of our Company.
 
We will participate in an acquisition only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties before and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.
 
We believe there are certain perceived benefits to being a public company whose securities are publicly traded, including the following:
 

● | increased visibility in the financial community; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased valuation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | greater ease in raising capital; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compensation of key employees through stock options for which there may be a market valuation; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enhanced corporate image. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are also certain perceived disadvantages to being a trading company including the following:
 

● | required publication of corporate information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | required filings of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business entities, if any, which may be interested in a combination with us may include the following:
 

● | a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a company which wishes to become public with less dilution of its securities than would occur upon an underwriting; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United States securities market; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified Employee Stock Option Plan; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a company seeking one or more of the other perceived benefits of becoming a public company. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A business combination with a private company will normally involve the transfer to the private company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. and the substitution by the private company of its own management and board of directors.
 
The proposed business activities described herein classify us as a “shell” company. The Securities and Exchange Commission and certain states have enacted statutes, rules, and regulations regarding the sales of securities of shell companies, as well as limitations on a shareholder’s ability to sell their “restricted” securities. Rule 144 is not available to a shareholder of a shell company unless and until the Company files a registration statement with the SEC that includes certain specific information about existing business operations of a registrant and thereafter must wait an additional one year to take advantage of that exemption from registration.
 
Rule 12b-2 of the 34 Act defines a shell company as a company that has:
 

(1) | No or nominal operations; and 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Either:
----+--------


(i) | No or nominal assets;
----+----------------------


(ii) | Assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or
-----+----------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets.
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will continue to file all reports required of us under the Exchange Act until a business combination has occurred, or we organically build our business from the cash raised from investors. A business combination will normally result in a change in the control and management of our Company. Since a principal benefit of a business combination with us would normally be considered our status as a reporting company, it is anticipated that we will continue to file reports under the Exchange Act following a business combination. No assurance can be given that this will occur or, if it does, for how long.
 
EMPLOYEES 
 
Except for our Court-appointed custodian who is acting as both our interim director and officer, we have no employees
