Item 1. Business
Company History and Certain Recent Developments



We were incorporated, in Delaware, as Pensare Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) on April 7, 2016 for the purpose of entering into one or more mergers, share exchanges, asset acquisitions, stock purchases, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other similar business combinations with one or more target businesses.



On April 7, 2020 (the “Computex Closing Date”), we consummated a business combination transaction (the “Computex Business Combination”) in which we acquired Stratos Management Systems, Inc. (“Computex”), a private operating company that does business as Computex Technology Solutions. In connection with the closing of the Computex Business Combination, the Company changed its name to American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc.



On December 1, 2020 (the “Kandy Closing Date”), we acquired the Kandy Communications business (hereafter referred to as “Kandy” or “Kandy Communications”) from Ribbon Communications, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (“Ribbon”), by acquiring certain assets, assuming certain liabilities and acquiring all of the outstanding membership interests of Kandy Communications LLC.



On September 16, 2021, the Company announced that as a result of a decision by the Company’s Board of Directors to explore strategic alternatives previously announced on April 7, 2021, the Board had authorized the Company to focus its strategy on acquisitions and organic growth in its cloud technologies business as well as to explore strategic opportunities for its IT solutions business, including the divestiture of Computex. The Company believed that such changes would allow it to optimize resource allocation, focus on core competencies, and improve its ability to invest in areas of maximal growth potential.



On December 2, 2021, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC and certain affiliated entities (“Monroe”) for a $27 million term loan facility (or the “Credit Facility”), part of which was used to pay off amounts owing under a prior credit agreement with Comerica Bank (the “Prior Credit Agreement”) which was assumed as part of the Computex Business Combination. The remainder of the proceeds from the Credit Agreement was to be used for working capital and general business purposes. The terms of the Credit Agreement are discussed in Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.



On January 27, 2022, the Company announced that it had executed a definitive agreement to sell Computex, and on March 15, 2022, the sale of Computex was consummated, completing the Company’s transition to a pure-play cloud communications and collaboration company, centered on the Kandy platform. As a result, Computex is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2021 and its operations are classified as discontinued operations. In connection with the planned sale of Computex, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $32.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”) which represented the excess of the carrying value of the Computex reporting unit over the expected sale proceeds less costs to sell. Net proceeds from the sale of Computex, after payment of closing obligations and certain indebtedness are being used for working capital and general business purposes.



In addition, as more fully discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company completed the sale of certain securities, including the sale of common stock, preferred stock and warrants. In connection with the sale of these securities, the Company also completed certain share registrations. Two of the five series of warrants were exercised soon after they were issued resulting in proceeds of approximately $5.0 million during Fiscal 2021.



Subsequent to December 31, 2021, and as more fully discussed in Note 18 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company sold additional securities.

Our Business



The Kandy cloud communications platform is a cloud-based, real-time communications platform, offering proprietary unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”), communications platform as a service (“CPaaS”), contact center as a service (“CCaaS”), Microsoft Teams Direct Routing as a Service (“DRaaS”), and SIP Trunking as a Service capabilities. Kandy is one of the largest pure-play providers of UCaaS, CCaaS, CPaaS and Direct Routing as a Service (DRaaS) for enterprise customers.



As a provider of cloud-based enterprise services, Kandy deploys a global carrier grade cloud communications platform that supports the digital and cloud transformation of mid-market and enterprise customers across any device, on any network, in any location. The Kandy platform is based on a powerful, proprietary multi-tenant, highly scalable, and secure cloud platform that includes pre-built customer engagement tools, based on web real-time communications technology (“WebRTC technology”) that enables frictionless communications. Further, we support rapid service creation and multiple go to market models including white labelling, multi-tier channel distribution, enterprise direct, and self-service via our SaaS (software as a service) web portals.



Our cloud-based, real-time communications platform, enables service providers, enterprises, software vendors, systems integrators, partners and developers to enrich their applications and their services with real-time contextual communications empowering the API (Application Programming Interface) economy. With Kandy’s platform, companies of various sizes and types can quickly embed real-time communications capabilities into their existing applications and business processes, providing a more engaging user experience.



While the cloud communications business is focused on highly complex, medium and large enterprise deployments, the customer experience is augmented by our managed services capabilities. In addition, our strategic partnerships with companies such as AT&T, IBM, and Etisalat give us access to a marquee customer base and the ability to sell end to end solutions.



Growth Strategy



The acquisition of Kandy has given us the opportunity to provide a full suite of UCaaS, CPaaS, and CCaaS products to serve the rapidly growing cloud communications market.  Customers today demand a highly reliable, secure, and scalable communications platform along with a world class customer experience.



With demand for cloud technology increasing, we believe that the already sizable total addressable market (“TAM”) for cloud communications is on track to continue to expand and we believe that we are positioned to monetize mega trends in enterprise cloud communications, gain market share as a premier white-label cloud communications provider, checking the CPaaS, CCaaS, UCaaS and DRaaS boxes, while also capitalizing on our direct to enterprise capabilities (for example, Tier 1 support) to sell through our partners or sell directly.



Certain areas of our growth plan, which also includes continued investment in research and development, are as follows:




● | Channel (white label) - Target technology providers, such as Service Providers (SPs), Resellers, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), and Systems Integrators (SIs) through 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Strategic Alliances with companies looking to co-invest to monetize cloud communications technology; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Our partners that are looking to white-label or resell cloud technologies, which we believe offer significant opportunity to grow revenue with existing partners while identifying new ones. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct to Enterprise - Target enterprises looking to deploy their own cloud technology using APIs/SDKs (application programming interface/software development kit) and are looking to enable cloud communications to support their business and customer communications and interactions either

o | Organically - By targeting select vertical markets with high growth potential for example, government, retail, financial, & healthcare; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Inorganically - By making selective acquisitions to expand the use of the Kandy platform.

Key Trends Affecting Our Business



We believe the following key trends present growth opportunities for our business:




● | Disruptive technologies are creating complexity and challenges for customers and vendors. The rapid evolution of disruptive technologies, and the speed by which they impact an organization’s technology platforms, has made it difficult for customers to effectively design, procure, implement and manage their own IT systems. Moreover, increased budget pressures, fewer internal resources, a fragmented vendor landscape and fast time-to-value expectations make it challenging for customers to design, implement and manage, efficient, secure and cost-effective IT environments. Customers are increasingly turning to IT solutions providers to implement or help them implement complex IT offerings, including software defined infrastructure, cloud computing, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, big data analytics, and flash storage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Migration from on-premise communication solutions to cloud hosted services. The migration to cloud hosted services is in full swing with years of solid market growth. For years, on-premise PBX and Centrex carrier-hosted telephony switches dominated the market. In recent years, cloud communications technologies have eclipsed those functions which has led to lower human, capital and operational costs. The transformation to the cloud is accelerating. Complimenting those technologies with video, messaging and embedded communications is adding to revenue streams and productivity enhancements in the workplace. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increasing trend away from the use of hard phones. Business communications are rapidly moving away from hard phones to work-from-anywhere-applications on desktops and mobile phones. Further, customers are rapidly evolving to communications that are embedded within applications and business process flows without context switching between applications which leads to increased productivity and contextual communications. 




Additional growth opportunities for our business include:




● | The acceleration of digital transformation 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The change in how people work, including the “work from anywhere” mindset 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The increased complexity in mid & large enterprises and the desire by enterprises for integrated internal and external communications for UCaaS, CPaaS, CCaaS and DRaaS
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The demand for services similar to WebEx, Teams, & Zoom and partners that can add to and/or complement such tools and players 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The trend towards CPaaS technology – Product developers & Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) are increasingly seen as the influencers 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The general trend towards movement to the cloud 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The lack of sufficient internal IT resources at mid-sized and large enterprises, and the scarcity of IT personnel in certain high-demand disciplines 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The recognition that certain IT services provide the opportunity of funding via recurring payments over a period of time, rather than large upfront payments 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The increasing use of multi-cloud strategies, whereby cloud architectures and cloud-enabled frameworks, whether public, private, or hybrid, provide the core foundation of modern IT 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The explosive growth in remote workforce needs.

Successor/Predecessor References



In the Computex Business Combination, AVCT was considered the acquirer and Computex was considered the acquiree and the Predecessor for accounting purposes. The Computex Business Combination, which was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, reflects a new basis of accounting that is based on the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, we distinguish between the entity that existed before the Computex Closing Date (“Predecessor”) and the entity that existed on and after such date (“Successor”).



Major customers



All segments (Kandy and Computex)



The five top customers during Fiscal 2021 accounted for 17% of revenues. The top five customers during the Successor period April 7, 2020 to December 31, 2020 accounted for 24% of total revenue. No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 nor during the Successor period April 7, 2020 to December 31, 2020.

Kandy only



The five top customers during Fiscal 2021 accounted for 68% of revenues. Three customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, accounting for $9.9 million of Kandy’s revenue.



Competition



Kandy primarily competes with technology and cloud providers such as 8X8, RingCentral, Vonage, Twilio, Nice and Five 9, among others. However, Kandy differentiates itself from its competitors largely by the nature of its route to market - its platform is a proprietary white label, and global cloud platform that support one or a multi-tier distribution via the CSP (communications service provider), VAR (value-added reseller) or ISV (independent software vendor) brand.  Further, in addition to being a true multi-tenant platform, Kandy supports a BYOD (bring your own data) and BYOC (bring your own carrier) model while providing both a light weight and heavy weight OSS/BSS (Ordering/Billing) system and automation integration with its channel partners.  Lastly, the Kandy platform brings a ubiquitous experience across UCaaS, CCaaS, and CPaaS versus most of the competition who play in one or two of these communications market verticals.
International Operations and Segments



The Company’s reportable segments in Fiscal 2021 were Computex and Kandy. At December 31, 2021, approximately 110 associates were employed in our international operations. All such international employees were employed in our Kandy segment.
Research and Development



Through Kandy, we incur software development costs to enhance, improve, expand and/or upgrade our proprietary software in an agile software environment with releases broken down into several iterations called sprints. These development activities are performed by internal staff primarily located outside of the US.



Through our Kandy R&D team, we focus our research and development efforts on building a carrier-grade communications platform, middleware, software application clients and believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to innovate and sustain a competitive differentiation. Therefore, our research and development focuses on deploying next generation software technologies, making communications more frictionless, and supporting multiple go-to-market strategies, including channel and direct sales models.



As of December 31, 2021, our research and development team consisted of approximately 65 associates (excluding contractors). All of our research and development associates are employed by Kandy.



Sales and Marketing



We target customers of varying sizes in both the private and public sector and develop relationships with them through direct marketing efforts as well as through strategic relationships with our technology partners.



We acquire new account relationships through face-to-face field sales, through relationships with our partners and through targeted direct marketing efforts that aim to increase awareness of our solutions.



Our sales representatives are compensated through a combination of fixed and variable compensation. Variable compensation or commission becomes the primary basis of compensation as sales representatives gain more experience.



Proprietary Rights 



We rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and contractual provisions to protect the proprietary rights of our products, processes and technology. In addition, we sometimes enter into confidentiality and assignment-of-rights agreements with our employees, consultants and customers and limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We license our proprietary products to our customers under license agreements that we believe contain appropriate use and other restrictions. However, despite our efforts to safeguard our proprietary rights, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully deter misappropriation or unauthorized third-party use of such rights. As is the case with any software company, safeguarding unauthorized use of our software is difficult, and piracy could become a problem. In addition, if we are engaged in transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are not well enforced, our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be effective. Enforcing our proprietary rights in the U.S. and abroad and any litigation to enforce such rights, can result in significant costs and can divert resources, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



As the number of solutions available in the marketplace increases and solution functionality continues to overlap, software companies may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or other misappropriation of intellectual property. Third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us relating to our software, processes or technology. Following up such claims, whether or not they have merit, can be time-consuming and can result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention away from operations or cause delays in our business or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Defending such claims, entering into royalty or licensing agreements, or adverse determinations in proprietary rights litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.

COVID-19



COVID-19 continues to significantly impact local, regional, and global economies, businesses, supply chains, production and sales across a range of industries. The extent of its impact on our operational and financial performance is uncertain and difficult to predict and we remain cautious about the global recovery.



To protect the health and safety of our employees, our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model. However, we have found ways to continue to engage with and assist our customers and partners as they work to navigate the current environment. We will continue to monitor the current environment and may take further actions that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine to be in the interests of our employees, customers, and partners.



Human Capital



Our core values – Integrity, innovation, delighting our clients, diversity and teamwork are communicated to our employees on joining our company and we strive to maintain and demonstrate these values to our associates in the decisions we make and the actions we take. We believe one of our greatest assets is our people and believe adherence to such policies play a key role in the success of our company.
Integrity – We strive to earn the trust of our customers, partners, and associates through honesty, openness, and ethical, and fair behavior. We respect everyone and believe we should treat others as we expect to be treated.
Innovation - We are committed to continuous progress, never settling for yesterday’s solutions or successes.



Delighting our clients – We are committed to delighting our clients with exceptional and personalized services.



Diversity – We believe it takes people with different ideas, experiences, strengths, interests and backgrounds to succeed.



Teamwork – We understand that we achieve everything together and are accountable to each other for our results.



At December 31, 2021, our employee base stood at approximately 356 employees worldwide, of which more than 30% were employed in our international operations. At March 15, 2022, following the sale of Computex, our employee base stood at approximately 175 employees worldwide, of which more than 63% were employed in our international operations. We have offices in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, as well as representatives in the United Kingdom, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. None of our employees are represented by unions and we consider the relationships with our employees to be good. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 19.1% of our workforce. The attrition rate in Fiscal 2021 was 19.8%.



As of December 31, 2021, the composition of our employee base was as follows:




 | | | | | Computex | 
--------------------------+-----------+---+-------+-----+------------------------+------
 | | | | | (held for sale at | 
 | Corporate | | Kandy | | December 31, 2021) | Total
Sales and marketing | | - | | 36 | | 54 | 90 
Product support and R&D | | - | | 124 | | 3 | 127
Engineers | | - | | - | | 108 | 108
Admin | | 9 | | 6 | | 16 | 31 
Total number of employees | | 9 | | 166 | | 181 | 356




But for the Computex employees, the above table also approximates our employee base as of March 15, 2022, after the sale of Computex.



We offer fair and competitive compensation and benefit packages to our employees that include base salary, incentives, adequate paid time off and various health insurance plan options. To protect the health and safety of our employees and others, in response to COVID-19, our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model. We support the development of our employees by reimbursing them for certain continuous education programs. COVID-19 has changed the way people work and we have endeavored to facilitate an environment that allows our employees to work from where they are and have adopted hybrid options. We recognize the importance of remaining flexible and agile in the current environment with respect to the needs of our employees.

Backlog



Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet, which relate to payments received but for which the related performance obligations have not yet been performed, was $3.3 million at December 31, 2021, of which $3.2 million relates to the Computex reporting unit which was classified as held for sale at December 31, 2021 and was sold on March 15, 2022. These amounts primarily relate to payments received that were contractually due, in advance of providing the products or performing the services. The related performance obligations for such payments are expected to be performed, and the related revenue recognized in the applicable company’s financial statements, within 12 months of the reporting date, most of which will be recognized as revenue by the buyer of Computex after the sale of Computex.



Further, we allocate a contract’s transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and recognize the revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2021, total transaction price for remaining performance obligations associated with non-cancelable contracts longer than 12 months that are expected to be recognized over future periods by the Computex segment was approximately $27.9 million, most of which will be recognized as revenue by the buyer of Computex after the sale of Computex.



Seasonality



Except for Computex’s hardware revenue, the Company’s revenue is not considered to be seasonal. Computex’s hardware revenue tends to be seasonal with higher revenues occurring in the fourth quarter of each year. As previously indicated, Computex was sold in the first quarter of 2022.

We are an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”) and will remain an EGC for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion or our total annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an EGC as of the following fiscal year. As an EGC, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
