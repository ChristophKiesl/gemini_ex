Background
 Global Self Storage, Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”), formed as a Maryland corporation and is focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition, development and redevelopment of self storage facilities (“stores”). The Company’s stores are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Mid-West regions of the United States.
 The Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland, and from that date through the date of this annual report, the Company has been a corporation duly qualified and in good standing in that state.
 From September 1, 1983 to February 7, 1997, the Company was a diversified series of shares of Bull & Bear Incorporated, an open-end management investment company. On January 23, 1997, the Company (formerly known as Global Income Fund, Inc.) filed a Form N-8A Notification of Registration pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), registering the Company as an investment company thereunder, and a Registration Statement on Form N-2 for closed-end investment companies.  The Company commenced operations as a closed-end management investment company on February 7, 1997.
 On February 29, 2012, the Company's stockholders approved a proposal to change the Company's business from an investment company to an operating company that owns, operates, manages, acquires, develops, and redevelops professionally managed self storage facilities and seeks to qualify as a REIT for federal tax purposes (the "Business Proposal").
 The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) order approving the Company’s application to deregister from the 1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. Accordingly, effective January 19, 2016 and in connection with the Business Proposal, the Company changed its name to Global Self Storage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration to a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), from an investment company under the 1940 Act, and listed its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SELF”. The Company's fiscal/taxable year ends December 31.
 The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not be subject to tax, with certain limited exceptions, on the taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.
 The Company is authorized to issue 19,900,000 shares of $0.01 par value common stock. The Company also has 100,000 shares of Series A participating preferred stock, $0.01 par value, authorized, of which none has been issued. As of December 31, 2016, 7,619,469 shares of common stock of the Company were outstanding and held by 33 stockholders of record.
 On January 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (“Board of Directors” or “Board”) has adopted a stockholders rights plan (the “Rights Plan”). To implement the Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of Company common stock, par value $.01 per share, to holders of record of the shares of common stock at the close of business on January 29, 2016. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. The rights were distributed as a non-taxable dividend and will expire on January 29, 2026. The rights were evidenced by the underlying Company common stock, and no separate preferred stock purchase rights certificates have been distributed. The rights to acquire preferred stock are not immediately exercisable and will become exercisable only if a person or group, other than Exempt Persons (as defined in the Rights Plan agreement), acquires or commences a tender offer for 9.8% or more of the Company’s common stock. If a person or group, other than an Exempt Person, acquires or commences a tender offer for 9.8% or more of the Company’s common stock, each holder of a right, except the acquirer, will be entitled, subject to the Company’s right to redeem or exchange the right, to exercise, at an exercise price of $12, the right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of 
 5

the Company’s newly created Series A Participating Preferred Stock, or the number of shares of Company common stock equal to the holder’s number of rights multiplied by the exercise price and divided by 50% of the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the occurrence of such an event. The Company’s Board of Directors may terminate the Rights Plan at any time or redeem the rights, for $0.01 per right, at any time before a person acquires 9.8% or more of the Company’s common stock. This Rights Plan replaced the Company’s stockholders rights plan dated November 25, 2015, which expired on its own terms on March 24, 2016.
 Principal Business Activities
 As of March 22, 2017, the Company has 24 total employees (13 full-time) and owns, operates and manages, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, eleven stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. As of December 31, 2016, these facilities total 754,095 net leasable square feet and offer 5,625 storage units. In addition to traditional and climate-controlled units, many of the facilities feature both covered and outside auto/RV/boat storage. The Company invests in stores by acquiring stores through its wholly owned subsidiaries and operates primarily in one segment:  rental operations.  
 We continue to evaluate and enact a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to help enable us maximize our stores’ financial performance and stockholder value. Our strategies in seeking to maximize our stores’ financial performance and stockholder value include, among others, the following:
  
• | continue to implement and refine our move-in rate management systems in seeking to maximize occupancies and thus revenue derived from our store portfolio.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to implement and refine our existing tenant revenue rate management systems in seeking to maximize revenue per leased square foot from our store portfolio.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to implement and refine our digital, drive-by, and referral marketing programs in seeking to attract more and higher quality (e.g. credit card paying) customers to our stores at a lower net cost.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to pursue the acquisition of single stores and small portfolios that we believe can add stockholder value.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our stores are generally located in densely populated and high traffic areas near major roads and highways. All of our stores display prominent road signage and most feature LED marquee boards describing the store features and move-in rent specials. Our stores are generally located in areas with strict zoning laws and attentive planning boards which make it difficult for our competition to develop new facilities near ours. As we evaluate potential stores, we seek stores in areas with these high barriers to entry.
 Most of our stores compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends. Because we operate in competitive markets, often where self storage consumers have multiple stores from which to choose, such competition has affected and is likely to continue to affect our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels as well, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity. We believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name “Global Self Storage,” and our economies of scale help enable us to meet such challenges effectively. 
 In seeking to maximize the performance of our stores, we employ our proprietary revenue rate management systems which help us to analyze, adjust, and set our move-in and existing tenant rental rates on a real-time basis across our portfolio.  Among other technologies, we employ internet data scraping of our local competitors’ move-in rental rates to help enable us to proactively respond and take advantage of changing market conditions across our portfolio of stores. Our operating results typically depend significantly on our ability to manage our storage units’ rental rates, to respond in a timely manner to prospective tenant inquiries, and to lease available storage units, and on the ability of our tenants to make required storage unit rental payments.
 We have registered the trademark and developed the brand "Global Self Storage." We have developed a corporate logo and have incorporated it on all of our on-site signage, advertising and other marketing materials. This

branding process has included the creation and development of the www.GlobalSelfStorage.us website, whereby prospective customers can click through and read and learn about the features of any of our self storage facilities in their various locations. We continue to develop the Global Self Storage internet presence through advertising and search engine optimization. We solicit tenant reviews for posting to the “Testimonials” section of our website and encourage others to view these reviews. We have found that a reliable source of new tenants is through referrals of current tenants. Existing self storage customers may also pay their storage unit rent on-line through www.GlobalSelfStorage.us.
 Attracting high quality, long-term tenants is a top priority for the Company and we strongly believe in tenant quality over tenant quantity. In our marketing efforts, we have seen success in our referral marketing program, through which our tenants may recommend Global Self Storage to their family, friends, and colleagues. We also believe our store managers’ attention to detail – maintaining security, cleanliness, and attentive customer service – is essential to attracting high quality tenants.
 Tenant leases at all of our stores are “month-to-month” leases. We seek to deliver at least 30 days’ written notice of any rental rate change. Lease rates at each store may be set monthly, semi-annually, annually, or at any other time on a case-by-case basis as determined in the discretion of management. Tenants may be assessed late, administrative, and/or other fees. To date, none of the Company’s stores have experienced any material delinquencies.
 Each of our stores features a rental and payment center kiosk available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, where prospective tenants can rent a unit and current tenants can pay their rent. All of our stores have on-site property managers who are committed to delivering the finest customer service. Our customer call center handles telephone inquiries from current and prospective tenants whenever our store managers are not available. They can respond to questions about our stores and storage features, and book reservations. We seek to deliver convenience and high quality customer service to our tenants, as well as maintain clean and secure stores at all times.
 Please refer to Item 7 herein for further discussion of, among other things, competitive business conditions, the Company’s competitive position in the self storage industry, methods of competition, and the effect of existing or probable government regulations on the Company’s business. The public may read and copy any materials the Company has filed with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Additional information about the Company, not contained in this form or made a part hereof, may be found at www.GlobalSelfStorage.us.  
 Acquisitions and Financing
 In our store acquisition strategy, we will seek to continue to focus on secondary and tertiary cities in the Mid-West, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic parts of the country where we believe there is relatively less self storage space per capita available, generally resulting in greater demand for available self storage square feet; where new self storage development and permitting through the local planning and zoning boards is typically more difficult to secure thus creating barriers to entry for new self storage competition; and where local new supply through new development is generally less threatening.
 We continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that, should interest rates increase, resulting store capitalization rates may also increase and store prices may begin to decrease. We will seek to continue to employ our strict acquisition underwriting standards and remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions where we believe that our management techniques and innovations can strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.

The Company currently intends to use cash, proceeds from mortgage financing, and/or proceeds from sales of its remaining portfolio of investment securities to acquire, re-develop, and/or operate additional and existing stores.  For future acquisitions, the Company may use various financing and capital raising alternatives including, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with third parties.
