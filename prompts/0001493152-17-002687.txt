ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 
We are an ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical company specialized in the development, production and sale of innovative medications that offer unique competitive advantages and serve unmet needs in the marketplace. We are committed to our company’s mission, vision and values to deliver high-quality novel medications to physicians and patients at affordable prices.
 
The cornerstone of our ophthalmology program consists of our proprietary Dropless Therapy® injectable and LessDrops® topical formulations that compete in the multi-billion dollar U.S. eye drop market. These formulations have been uniquely designed to address patient compliance issues and provide other compelling medical and economic benefits. We also offer a conscious sedation medication, the IV Free MKO Melt™, a proprietary alternative to intravenous sedation. The MKO Melt is administered sublingually to sedate patients undergoing ocular and other surgeries. We plan to expand our ophthalmology program and introduce additional innovative medications for glaucoma, wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and chronic dry eye disease (DED). Our integrative medicine business includes medications used in several therapeutic areas including oncology, autoimmunity, chronic infectious diseases, and endocrine and metabolic diseases. Our urology business includes a series of injectable erectile dysfunction formulations for patients that are refractory to or are otherwise unable to take phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), and vardenafil (Levitra®). We also make PPS-DR® (pentosan polysulfate sodium delayed-release) formulations as lower-cost alternatives to Elmiron® for patients diagnosed with interstitial cystitis. We also make and sell low-cost therapeutic alternatives to Daraprim®, Thiola® and Calcium Disodium Versenate, all FDA-approved drugs that have experienced significant price increases.
 
Approximately 90 percent of our revenue is derived from buy-and-bill customers as a cash pay business, and as such, the majority of our commercial transactions do not involve distributors, wholesalers, insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers or other middle parties. We do not operate using and are not dependent on discount cards, rebates, or other methods and programs that typically eliminate transparency to the consumer. By making ourselves generally independent of third party payments, we are not subject to insurance company formulary inclusion and pharmacy benefit manager payment clawbacks. In this regard, our transactions are simple, involving a patient-in-need, a physician’s diagnosis and a fair price and great service for a quality pharmaceutical product. The efficiency of our business model allows us to quickly innovate and safely deliver novel and clinically relevant products to the market with less complications and at lower costs for our customers than traditional pharmaceutical company competitors.

We currently produce and dispense our medications directly to customers through our ImprimisRx facilities located in Ledgewood, New Jersey, Irvine, California and Folcroft, Pennsylvania. Our New Jersey facility is comprised of two separate facilities, with one facility registered with the FDA as an outsourcing facility (“NJOF”) under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA). The other New Jersey facility (“NJRX”), and our California and Pennsylvania facilities, are all licensed pharmacies operating under Sections 503A of the FDCA. All products that we sell, produce and dispense are made in the United States of America.
 
Our proprietary drug formulations are born from the clinical experience of a network of inventors, including physician prescribers, clinical researchers and pharmacist formulators, who develop and prescribe personalized medicines for individual patient needs. We work collaboratively with these inventors to identify and evaluate intellectual property related to potential candidates, assess relevant markets, and seek to validate the clinical experience with the objective of investing in commercialization activities. Although our business is focused on a pharmaceutical compounding commercialization strategy, we may also consider other commercialization pathways, including pursuing FDA approval to market and sell a drug formulation or technology.
 
We have incurred recurring operating losses and have had negative operating cash flows since July 24, 1998 (inception). In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $76,851 at December 31, 2016. Beginning on April 1, 2014, when we acquired our first ImprimisRx compounding pharmacy, we began generating revenue from sales of certain of our proprietary drug formulations and other non-proprietary formulations; however, we expect to incur further losses as we integrate and develop our pharmacy operations, evaluate other programs and continue the development of our formulations.
 
Below are descriptions of our current commercial programs. We also continue to evaluate and assess intellectual property and other assets we have developed or acquired, including provisional patent applications, in order to support our development and potential commercialization of additional medications focused in the ophthalmology market and in other therapeutic areas.
 
Ophthalmology
 
In 2013, we acquired intellectual property trademarked as SSP Technology®, which allows for combination and administration of anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agents after the completion of ocular surgery. SSP Technology allows for increased solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the creation of tunable, uniform particle sizes which enable these combined medications to be used as an intraoperative injectable or as a topical eye drop. Since our acquisition of this technology we have continued its development to include additional active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as NSAIDs. These combination medications have begun to impact the growing cataract surgery eye drop and refractive surgery eye drop markets. Based on our success and standing in the ophthalmology market, we plan to expand into additional ocular surgery markets where there is a risk of inflammation and infection and into other markets including glaucoma, wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and chronic dry eye disease.
 
Our proprietary ophthalmic medications provide physicians with the ability to address primary complications associated with ocular surgery including infection risk and post-operative inflammation due to patient non-compliance associated with traditional multiple bottle eye drop regimens. This is achieved by reducing the complexity of and in many cases altogether avoiding the need for post-operative eye drop regimens. We market these ophthalmic formulations as Dropless Therapy and LessDrops combination eye drops. We also package multiple ophthalmic medications, which may include our proprietary Dropless Therapy or LessDrops formulations, and other non-proprietary formulations as kits and dispensed to patients with needs for multiple ocular therapies.

Dropless Therapy
 
The cataract surgery market continues to experience significant growth. According to a 2013 Market Scope report, 3.8 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. and nearly 22 million cataract surgeries were performed globally, with expected annual market growth of approximately 3 percent. The National Eye Institute estimates that over 24 million Americans currently have cataracts and that number will grow to 38 million by 2030 and reach more than 50 million by 2050. Transparency Market Research estimates that the ophthalmology drug market will reach an estimated $21.6 billion by 2018.
 
Typically, the treatment regimen for the prevention of post-cataract and other intraocular surgery complications is a pre-operative and post-operative self-administered eye drop regimen, which requires strict patient compliance and careful adherence to a prescribed dosing schedule. Physicians have reported, and studies have shown, that eye drop regimens can be confusing to patients, which can cause non-compliance and incorrect dosing. Numerous published studies conducted in the U.S. and Europe have demonstrated that antibiotics administered into the eye at the time of cataract surgery significantly reduced the risk of developing post-surgery inflammation and infection.
 
Our Dropless Therapy medications are single, injectable intraocular doses that are administered during cataract surgery. Ophthalmologists have reported that Dropless Therapy has substantially reduced or eliminated the need for patient-administered eye drops following ocular surgery, thereby largely eliminating patient non-compliance and dosing errors associated with post-operative self-administered eye drop care regimens. Since launching Dropless Therapy in April 2014, multiple investigator initiated studies have been completed and their positive findings published in trade and peer-reviewed publications. A recently published study comparing Dropless Cataract Surgery to post-surgical topical drops found that 92 percent of the patients preferred Dropless Therapy over eye drops, and regarding post-operative visual outcome, 88 percent of patients preferred Dropless over topical drops. In a large peer-reviewed retrospective study of 1,541 patients receiving Dropless Therapy during cataract surgery, researchers reported that nearly 92 percent of the cases required no supplemental medication following surgery. A 2015 economic study with Cataract Surgeons for Improved Eyecare and conducted by Andrew Chang & Co, LLC, demonstrated that, assuming a cost of $100 per dose (dollar amount not expressed in thousands), Dropless Therapy could provide collective savings to Medicare, Medicaid and patients of up to $13 billion, with a most likely savings estimate of $8.7 billion, over a 10-year period. 
 
LessDrops Combination Eye Drops
 
In addition to the 3.8 million cataract surgeries performed annually in the U.S., the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) estimates that over one-half of Americans require some form of vision correction and 43 million of these individuals are candidates for refractive surgery. Nearly 96 percent of the refractive surgery procedures performed are LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) surgeries, an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. According to Statista, an estimated 600,000 LASIK procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2015.
 
Our LessDrops® topical formulations, introduced during first quarter 2015, include combination steroid, antibiotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory topical eye drops for patient administration following cataract, refractive and other ocular surgeries. We estimate that our LessDrops combination eye drops may require the administration by patients of up to 50 percent fewer drops post-surgery and cost up to 75 percent less than other currently available post-surgery eye drop regimens. We plan to expand our LessDrops portfolio to provide additional eye drop choices for our ophthalmologist customers. We believe we are capturing an estimated 10 percent of the U.S. post-surgery cataract eye drop market. Over 1,500 ophthalmologist customers have adopted Dropless and LessDrops medications and we have serviced over 600,000 cataract and refractive surgeries since April 2014. A growing number of high-volume cataract surgery practices, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers throughout the U.S. have become customers.
 
Glaucoma Eye Drops
 
During the second quarter of 2017, we intend to launch a series of preservative-free eye drops and combination eye drops for glaucoma patients. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, there are over 3 million Americans with glaucoma but only half are aware they have it. Glaucoma is incurable, and if not managed can lead to blindness. Generally, the first line of treatment consists of a prostaglandin-analogue (PGA) eye drop regimen. As the disease progresses, non-PGA products are generally added as a second line treatment. Topical agents, other than PGAs, include beta blockers, alpha agonists, miotics and steroids. Up to 50 percent of glaucoma patients require more than one drug following a few months of initial treatment, however the FDA has yet to approve a PGA combination product despite combination products including a PGA (Xalacom®, DuoTrav® and Ganfort®) available outside of the U.S. Our glaucoma topical medications will include combinations of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that are similar to those formulations marketed and available in countries outside of the U.S. Our combination eye drops may require the administration of fewer drops by patients and cost significantly less than currently available glaucoma drop regimens.
 
We believe the use of combination products is rising because of two major advantages; improved patient compliance by avoiding separate administration of drops and prevention of washout effect by eliminating the need for consecutive dosing intervals.

MKO Melt™ Conscious Sedation
 
In May 2016, we launched our patent-pending IV Free MKO Melt™ conscious sedation formulation. Traditionally, sedation medications for ocular surgery are administered intravenously, which require IV medications and supplies, and the need for additional staff to assist in preparation, administration and monitoring related to this process. Our MKO Melt is administered sublingually and is an option to IV anesthetic to sedate patients undergoing ocular surgeries. The MKO Melt may have use in numerous other surgical procedures outside of ophthalmology including MRI procedures, dental procedures, colonoscopies, vasectomies, biopsies and women’s health.
Integrative Medicine
 
Our integrative medicine business includes personalized medications used in several integrative areas including oncology, autoimmunity, chronic infectious diseases, and endocrine and metabolic diseases. The portfolio includes ascorbic acid (non-corn source), patent-pending curcumin emulsion, lyophilized artesunate and other medications used for various integrative therapies. We sponsor the Integrative Therapies Institute (ITI) conferences that cover a multitude of integrative topics and feature speakers considered thought leaders in their respective fields.
Urology 
 
We offer injectable medications for the treatment of erectile function (ED). According to the American Urological Association (AUA) there are 20 to 30 million men in the U.S. with ED. The AUA indicates that intracavernous vasoactive injections, including Tri-Mix (phentolamine, papaverine and prostaglandin), are considered the most effective non-surgical treatment for ED. We are also developing additional formulations associated with ED, including a sublingual formulation. We currently have one managed care provider that represents the majority of our Tri-Mix sales. We are currently marketing this large healthcare provider additional formulations, including our ophthalmic medications, and hope to grow our existing sales footprint and expand the relationship into other therapeutic areas.
 
In May 2016, we introduced our patent-pending customizable delayed-release tiopronin medications that may be prescribed by physicians as a lower-cost alternative to FDA-approved Thiola® for cystinuria patients. Cystinuria is a chronic genetic disease that causes stones made of the amino acid cystine to form in the kidneys, bladder and/or urethra. In addition to the significantly lower cost, our tiopronin medications may allow for a reduction in the number of pills patients are required to consume daily.
 
We also produce and dispense PPS-DR (pentosan polysulfate sodium) oral medications as a lower-cost option to an off-patent oral drug, Elmiron®, for the treatment of symptoms associated with interstitial cystitis (IC). IC, also referred to as painful bladder syndrome and chronic pelvic pain, is a chronic bladder condition. According to the Interstitial Cystitis Association, IC affects an estimated 4 to 12 million men and women in the U.S. There is no known cure for IC and a combination of therapies is recommended for most patients including medication, physical therapy and dietary changes. Our low-cost PPS-DR oral medications feature delayed-released capsules that may allow for reduced daily dosing requirements.


Other Markets and Development Programs 
 
In October 2015, we introduced our compounded pyrimethamine and leucovorin formulations, lower-cost therapeutic alternatives to FDA-approved Daraprim® for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis can be of major concern for patients with weakened immune systems such as patients with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women and children. Our combination pyrimethamine and leucovorin formulations are now offered by Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the U.S., and by many other hospitals and healthcare organizations.
 
In September 2016, we announced the availability of our EDTA calcium disodium injectable formulation, a lower-cost alternative to FDA-approved Calcium Disodium Versenate, commonly used to stabilize and treat patients exposed to lead poisoning.
 
We also offer hormone replacement therapy, weight loss, dermatologic, and other personalized medications, which we believe may provide differentiating and potentially beneficial factors as compared to competing therapies.
 
We have developed a patent-pending formulation that may be prescribed by physicians as a therapeutic alternative to an off-patent drug (name withheld for competitive reasons) that is prescribed for various indications mainly related to autoimmune diseases. The incumbent drug is known to present stability challenges, we have stability and potency data on our formulation beyond 120 days. The incumbent drug has no generic competition and annual sales were over $1 billion in the U.S. during 2016. We are currently evaluating potential opportunities for this formulation including working on its development and commercialization with a strategic partner and/or developing our own clinical development program.
 
Customer Relationships
 
We produce and dispense our innovative medications to a growing number of patients, physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs). In September 2016, we entered into a purchase and supply agreement with AmSurg Holdings, Inc. a leading national provider of multi-specialty outsourced physician services to more than 245 U.S. hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other healthcare facilities. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will provide AmSurg with our core ophthalmic medications including our Dropless Therapy and LessDrops combination eye drops.
 
In October 2016, we entered into a purchase and supply agreement with the specialty pharmacy division of a leading PBM with more than 65 million Americans covered. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will supply the network of specialty pharmacies with our complete formulary of medications. We believe the agreement represents a new approach to efficiently deliver medications from the manufacturer directly to the consumer, thereby eliminating several layers of inefficiencies for the millions of patients covered by this renowned PBM. We expect this agreement will help accelerate the adoption of several of our products we currently offer and others we expect to launch in 2017.

In December 2016, we announced the launch of Correct Compound™ program with FocusScript, LLC (FocusScript), the largest compounding claims management company in the U.S. Through the program, we will jointly offer FocusScript’s proprietary CDF-Logic program of a customizable compound formulary and our portfolio to PBMs, managed care organizations and other healthcare payors. FocusScript will manage and process Correct Compound claims across FocusScript’s preferred network of over 200 compounding pharmacies which are accredited and credentialed through the UCAP program, and administered in an exclusive partnership with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). FocusScript will also provide its custom, proprietary system for pre-processing claims for optimal pricing, broad analytics and real-time oversight of fraud, waste and abuse. We believe this partnership allows us to leverage the value we have built in our brand and maintain our focus and resources on our rapidly-growing ophthalmology business. FocusScript’s pharmacy network, relationships with payors and comprehensive prescription drug adjudication tools should help us increase our reach and lower costs that are typically associated with the billing and adjudication process of prescription medications.
 
Production Facilities
 
We produce and dispense our proprietary and non-proprietary medications directly to our customers through our three ImprimisRx facilities located in Ledgewood, New Jersey, Irvine, California and Folcroft, Pennsylvania. Our New Jersey facility is comprised of two separate entities/facilities, with one facility registered with the FDA as an outsourcing facility (“NJOF”) under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (FDCA). The other New Jersey facility (“NJRX”) and our California and Pennsylvania facilities make and sell both sterile and non-sterile medications are all licensed as pharmacies operating under Section 503A of the FDCA.
Pharmaceutical Compounding
 
All of our commercial products are compounded by combining different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), all of which are FDA-approved, to create specialized preparations prescribed by a physician to treat an individually identified patient. Physicians prescribe our products because a standard medication approved by the FDA is not appropriate for a particular patient’s needs. In many cases, compounded drugs such as ours have wide market utility and appeal for large patient populations. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions, or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. A physician may also work together with a pharmacist to repurpose or reformulate FDA-approved drugs via the compounding process to meet a patient’s specific medical needs. Our ImprimisRx compounding pharmacies receive their active pharmaceutical ingredients from three main suppliers, which accounted for 63 percent of drug and chemical purchases in 2016, also see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.
 
We currently operate our pharmacy businesses under Sections 503A and 503B of the FDCA. Under the FDA’s current policy, a pharmacy operating under Section 503A of the FDCA is only permitted to compound a drug for an individually identified patient based on a prescription for that patient, and is only permitted to distribute the drug interstate if the pharmacy is licensed to do so in the states where it is compounded and where it is received. Our ImprimisRx compounding pharmacies are collectively licensed to distribute compounded formulations in 50 states. Federal law limits compounding pharmacies from engaging in the practice of anticipatory compounding, which involves, preparing compounded medications before the actual receipt of a prescription or practitioner’s order, unless the compounding pharmacy has a history of filling certain prescriptions for a customer. In such cases, it is legal to engage in anticipatory compounding or the preparation of larger batches so that medications will be ready when they are needed. Anticipatory compounding also reduces the cost of compounded medications, as economies of scale can be realized by producing larger batches. Anticipatory compounding also leads to less wasted chemicals, dilutions, fillers, and other associated products are produced, and greater accuracy and uniformity in finished medications, as larger batches decrease the variation caused by preparing multiple, smaller batches. Based on our history of meeting the needs of our customers, we are able to anticipatorily compound adequately and efficiently prepare batches of our formulations.
 
Outsourcing Facility Strategy
 
Section 503B of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy engaged in preparing sterile compounded drug formulations may voluntarily elect to register as an “outsourcing facility.” Outsourcing facilities are permitted to compound large quantities of drugs without a prescription and distribute them out of state with certain limitations such as the formulation appearing on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appearing on the FDA’s “clinical need” list. According to the University of Utah’s Drug Information Service, there were over 140 drugs on the FDA’s drug shortage list during 2015, while the “clinical need” list has not yet been established by FDA. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to additional requirements that do not apply to compounding pharmacies, including current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and regular FDA inspection. Due to the clinical need of the formulations we offer and the nature of the active pharmaceutical ingredient components, we believe our formulations will be eligible for compounding by and distribution from Section 503B outsourcing facilities.

In October 2016, we registered NJOF with the FDA as a Section 503B outsourcing facility. We estimate that our capital expenditures to build and equip our NJOF facility were approximately $5,770, of which, we have paid approximately $5,680, as of December 31, 2016. We have also finalized improvements to our California based pharmacy. We have invested approximately $530, to make the improvements and added capacity to the pharmacy, of which we have paid approximately $403, as of December 31, 2016. We completed the improvement efforts at our California pharmacy in January 2017.
 
In June 2016, our Texas facility was damaged by a faulty sprinkler head. We immediately commenced restoration efforts, notified our insurance carrier and filed claims for damages under our insurance policies, including claims related to business interruption (see discussion below regarding the Texas insurance claim). In September 2016, after consideration of the totality of circumstances surrounding our collective facility infrastructure, including estimated production capacity and capabilities of NJOF, and the damage to our Texas facility, we decided to cease operations in Texas. In February 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell our Texas entity for $10 and transfer the lease agreement to the new owners.
 
We believe that, with our current compounding pharmacy facilities and licenses and the successful completion and registration of our planned outsourcing facilities, we will have the infrastructure to scale our business appropriately under the current regulatory landscape and meet the growth in demand we are targeting in the ophthalmology, urology and other therapeutic areas. We plan to invest in one or more of our pharmacies to further their capacity and efficiencies. We may seek to access greater redundancy and markets through acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic transactions.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Although we believe that our proprietary drug formulations could have commercial appeal in international markets and we have engaged distributors and entered into out-licensing arrangements for certain of our proprietary formulations in certain non-U.S. markets, including Canada, we expect to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on our U.S. commercial opportunities during 2017. Our sales and marketing efforts are currently organized into two teams, the larger of which focuses on our ophthalmology business and the other on our non-ophthalmology business. Our sales and marketing activities consist primarily of efforts to educate doctors, ambulatory surgery centers, healthcare systems, hospitals and other users throughout the U.S. about our formulations. We expect that we may experience growth in the sales of our proprietary compounded formulations in future periods, particularly in light of our current and planned launches of new formulations and commercialization campaigns. We also may choose to pursue commercialization of our proprietary formulations in other selected markets through licensing or collaborative arrangements with strategic partners in the future.
Formulation Development and Commercialization Pathway
 
Our model for the selection and development of proprietary formulations focuses on assessing new development opportunities using a four-step proprietary process, consisting of the identification, evaluation, validation, and ultimately commercialization of selected opportunities. Our relationships with inventive physicians and pharmacists provide us with access to numerous formulation candidates and technologies to evaluate and validate. These medications are initially made for individual patients and are developed based on the physician’s and pharmacist’s experience formulating a new therapy to address an unmet need. As a result of our review process, we focus our commercialization efforts on a select group of promising formulations that we believe may be patentable and that could have broad appeal to patients and physicians. Our product development strategy is to focus on a select few therapeutic areas in which we believe there is broad market potential, large unmet needs and/or unique value to physicians and patients and to develop and offer formulations within these therapeutic areas that could afford us with gross margins.
Identify
 
Our innovation model, which serves as our research and development pipeline, relies on our relationships and partnerships with inventors to identify and secure new development assets. We are strategically attentive to the ideas generated by pharmacists, who work directly with doctors and their patients to address specific and often unmet patient needs, in our identification of formulations to develop and commercialize. We believe that our collaborative relationships with a growing group of physicians and pharmacists will bring additional clinically and commercially relevant formulation opportunities to us for potential development.
Evaluate 
 
After we have identified potential formulations and technology for development, we subject them to our proprietary evaluation process. We invest heavily in intellectual property review and analysis at this stage, which includes analyzing the patentability of each formulation and, more generally, trying to understand the surrounding intellectual property landscape. We also evaluate any existing supportive clinical data, identify one or more appropriate commercialization pathways to potentially make the therapy available to patients and, for selected candidates, ultimately seek to acquire, through ownership or licensing of development rights, the formulations we believe are the most promising.

8
-

Validate
 
Following the identification and evaluation process and our acquisition of development rights, we seek to validate our assessment of potential drug formulations through our review of any existing clinical data and documented patient experience and through our sponsorship of investigator-initiated studies, which are typically funded or co-funded by us and conducted by physician groups. Any clinical data we obtain may be used to support physicians’ clinical confidence in prescribing the formulation in compounded form or, if we decide to pursue FDA approval for a particular candidate to support a development program in connection with the pursuit of such approval. The costs associated with our validation approach may be significantly lower than a traditional FDA approval process because, if we consider and select compounding as an appropriate commercialization pathway, we would not need to obtain FDA approval in order to market and sell the formulation.
Commercialize
 
Following successful results in the first three steps of our assessment, we focus on commercialization. As part of the development of potential formulations, we evaluate and select an appropriate commercialization pathway to make these therapies available to patients. We consider multiple commercialization pathways, including dispensing formulations through compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities and pursuing FDA approval to market and sell a drug formulation or technology. We are pursuing, and expect to continue to pursue, a compounding commercialization strategy for our currently available proprietary formulations and the other assets that we currently own or have rights to develop, and we do not presently expect to pursue FDA approval for any of these formulations or other assets. Depending on the selected commercialization pathway, we would build, or contract with a third party to build, appropriately targeted commercialization teams in order to market the therapies to physicians and patients, consistent with our sales and marketing structure discussed under the “Sales and Marketing” section above.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against branded drug companies, generic drug companies, outsourcing facilities and other compounding pharmacies. We are significantly smaller than some of our competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our proprietary formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. The drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which our formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. Although we prepare some of our compounded formulations in accordance cGMP standards our other formulations are produced according to the standards provided by United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) <795> and USP <797> and applicable state and federal law, our proprietary compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA. As a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, our formulations. Additionally, under federal and state laws applicable to our current compounding pharmacy operations operating under Section 503A of the FDCA, are not permitted to prepare significant amounts of a specific formulation in advance of a prescription, compound quantities for office use or utilize a wholesaler for distribution of our formulations; instead, our compounded formulations must be prepared and dispensed in connection with a physician prescription for an individually identified patient. Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, are able to sell their FDA-approved products to large pharmaceutical wholesalers, who can in turn sell to and supply hospitals and retail pharmacies. Even though we have registered NJOF with the FDA, our business may not be scalable on the scope available to our competitors that produce FDA-approved drugs, which may limit our potential for profitable operations. These facets of our operations may subject our business to limitations our competitors offering FDA-approved drugs may not face.
 
Biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies, could render our products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete. Any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing the products, which may require that we seek to raise additional funds that may or may not be available to continue our operations. The competitive environment requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to develop and market these innovations effectively, and we may not be competitive with respect to these factors. Other competitive factors include the safety and efficacy of a product, the size of the market for a product, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of a product relative to alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement, the success of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition and the availability of scientific and technical information about a product. Although we believe we are positioned to compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, if our proprietary formulations are unable to compete with the products of our competitors, we may never gain market share or achieve profitability.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We conduct a fulsome analysis of the intellectual property landscape prior to acquiring rights to formulations and filing patent applications.  In addition, as of February 7, 2017, we owned 26 U.S. patent applications, including 21 utility (including continuation, continuation-in-part and divisional) and five provisional patent applications, and we owned five international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and 19 foreign patent applications.  Although our ophthalmology-related patent applications include claims related to non-ophthalmology fields, we have primarily focused our intellectual property development efforts to date on the proprietary compounded formulations in the field of ophthalmology.  We presently have 11 U.S. and 9 foreign patent applications pending that relate to our SSP Technology.  We expect to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and pursue patent protection for certain of our formulations in other important international jurisdictions in the future.

We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our current employees and certain consultants. However, our employees and consultants may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. In addition, inventions relevant to us could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us, in which case we may have no rights to use the applicable invention.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2012 (collectively, the Health Reform Law); statutes and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell. Below are descriptions of some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations.
Pharmacy Regulation
 
Our pharmacy operations are regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state’s board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states could be limited.
 
Many of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to our operations, we believe we comply with them.
 
Further, under federal law, Section 503A of the FDCA seeks to limit the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can dispense interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of this provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a standard Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each state setting forth limits on interstate compounding. The current draft standard MOU presented by the FDA in February 2015 would limit interstate shipments of compounded drug units to 30% of all compounded and non-compounded units dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy per month. The FDA has stated in guidance issued in February 2015 that it will not enforce interstate restrictions until after it publishes a final standard MOU and has made it available to states for signature for some designated period of time. If the final standard MOU is not signed by a particular state, then interstate shipments of compounded preparations from a pharmacy located in that state would be limited to quantities not greater than 5% of total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy (the 5% rule); however, we are not aware that the FDA currently enforces or has in the past enforced the 5% rule and, under current draft guidance, the FDA has stated that it will not enforce the 5% rule until a standard MOU has been made available to states for signature. The FDA has proposed a 180-day period for states to agree to the standard MOU after the final version is presented, after which it would begin to enforce the 5% rule. Until a final MOU is issued and presented to states to consider, the extent of interstate dispensing restrictions imposed by Section 503A is unknown. However, if the final standard MOU contains a 30% limit on interstate distribution or if the FDA begins to enforce the 5% rule, our pharmacy operations could be materially limited.

Certain provisions of the FDCA govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) clarifies and strengthens the federal regulatory framework governing compounding pharmacies. Title 1 of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, modifies provisions of the Section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. In general, Section 503A provides that pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring compliance with cGMP, labeling with adequate directions for use and FDA approval prior to marketing if the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to comply with Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded by a licensed pharmacist for an identified individual patient on the basis of a valid prescription. Pharmacies may only compound in limited quantities before receipt of a prescription for an individual patient and are subject to limitations on anticipatory compounding for distribution, which generally permit anticipatory compounding only based on historical prescription volumes.
 
The DQSA also contained new Section 503B of the FDCA, which established an outsourcing facility as a new form of entity that is permitted to compound larger quantities of drug formulations without a prescription, thus permitting the practice of anticipatory compounding, and distribute them out of state without limitation, if the drug formulations appear on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appear on a “clinical need” list to be established by the FDA. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspection, among other requirements. As described above, our current pharmacy operations comply with Section 503A of the FDCA, and our NJ based outsourcing facility complies with Section 503B of the FDCA.
 
Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA
 
Our pharmacy operations involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. In addition, we use aggregated and blinded (anonymous) data for research and analysis purposes. The federal privacy regulations under HIPAA are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to electronic protected health information. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related. Further, several states have enacted more protective and comprehensive pharmacy-related privacy legislation that not only applies to patient records but also prohibits the transfer or use for commercial purposes of pharmacy data that identifies prescribers. These regulations impose substantial requirements on covered entities and their business associates regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to personal health and non-health information. Many of these laws apply to our business.
 
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
 
Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. State-funded Medicaid programs provide medical benefits to groups of low-income and disabled individuals, some of whom may have inadequate or no medical insurance. Currently, most of our commercially available formulations are sold in cash transactions and our customers may choose to seek reimbursement opportunities from Medicare, Medicaid and other third parties to the extent that they exist. As part of our Imprimis Cares initiative, we work with third-party insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and buying groups to offer patient-specific customizable compounded formulations at accessible prices. We plan to continue to devote time and other resources to seek reimbursement and patient pay opportunities for these and other compounded formulations and we have hired pharmacy billers to process certain existing reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. However, we may be unsuccessful in achieving these goals, as many third-party payors have imposed significant restrictions on reimbursement for compounded formulations in recent years. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Health Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivable have a material effect on our business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points.
 
To the extent we obtain third-party reimbursement for our compounded formulations, we may become subject to Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims.

FDA New Drug Application Process
 
We may choose, alone or with project partners, to pursue FDA approval to market and sell one or more of our formulations through the FDA’s new drug application (NDA) process. Since the active pharmaceutical ingredients in all of our formulations have already been approved by the FDA, we could choose to pursue FDA approval of one or more of our formulations under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be performed for the new product and included in the NDA.
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book publication. As a condition of approval, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase 4 post-marketing studies, to provide additional data. Other post-marketing studies may be required to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA or other regulatory authorities require post-marketing reporting to monitor the adverse effects of a drug. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of a product.
 
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, fines and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 
International Regulation
 
If we pursue commercialization of our proprietary formulations in countries other than the United States, then we may need to obtain the approvals required by the regulatory authorities of such foreign countries that are comparable to the FDA and state boards of pharmacy, and we would be subject to a variety of other foreign statutes and regulations comparable to those relating to our U.S. operations. Regulatory frameworks and requirements vary by country and could involve significant additional licensing requirements and product testing and review periods.
Environmental and Other Matters
 
We are or may become subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and preparation of our formulations. In addition, we are subject to work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations. In each of these areas, as described above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, licenses or permits, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Research and Development Expenses
 
Our research and development expenses incurred in 2015 and 2016 primarily include expenses related to the development of intellectual property, researcher and investigator-initiated evaluations, and research and formulation development related primarily to our ophthalmic formulations and certain other assets.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $739 in research and development expenses, as compared to $332 during the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2017, we employed 144 employees, of which 141 are full-time employees and 3 are part-time employees. Our employees are engaged in pharmacy operations, sales, marketing, research, development, and general and administrative functions. We expect to add additional employees in all departmental functions as we carry out our business plan in the next 12 months. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements with any of our employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our employee relations are good. We hire independent contractor labor and consultants on an as-needed basis.
Company Information
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in January 2006 as Bywater Resources, Inc. In September 2007, we closed a merger transaction with Transdel Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. and changed our name to Transdel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We changed our name to Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2012.
