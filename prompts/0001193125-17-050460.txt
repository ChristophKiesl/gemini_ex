Item 1. Business of Community Health Systems, Inc.
Overview of Our Company 
 We are one of the largest publicly-traded hospital companies in the United States and a leading operator of general acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities in communities across the country. We were originally founded in 1986 and were reincorporated in 1996 as a Delaware corporation. We provide healthcare services through the hospitals that we own and operate and affiliated businesses in non-urban and selected urban markets throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we owned or leased 155 hospitals included in continuing operations, with an aggregate of 26,222 licensed beds, comprised of 152 general acute care hospitals and three stand-alone rehabilitation or psychiatric hospitals. These hospitals are geographically diversified across 21 states, with the majority of our hospitals located in regional networks or in close geographic proximity to one or more of our other hospitals. We also owned or leased three hospitals included in discontinued operations at December 31, 2016. We generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and specialized hospital healthcare services and outpatient services to patients in the communities in which we are located. Services provided through our hospitals and affiliated businesses include general acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. We also provide additional outpatient services at urgent care centers, occupational medicine clinics, imaging centers, cancer centers, ambulatory surgery centers and home health and hospice agencies. An integral part of providing these services is our network of affiliated physicians at our hospitals and affiliated businesses. As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,000 physicians and an additional 1,000 licensed healthcare practitioners. Through our management and operation of these businesses, we provide standardization and centralization of operations across key business areas; strategic assistance to expand and improve services and facilities; implementation of patient safety and quality of care improvement programs and assistance in the recruitment of additional physicians and licensed healthcare practitioners to the markets in which our hospitals are located. In a number of our markets, we have partnered with local physicians or not-for-profit providers, or both, in the ownership of our facilities. The financial information for our reportable operating segments is presented in Note 15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Form 10-K. 
 Our business strategy has historically included growth by acquisition. In this regard, we have generally targeted hospitals in growing, non-urban and selected urban healthcare markets for acquisition because of their favorable demographic and economic trends and competitive conditions. Because non-urban and suburban service areas have smaller populations, there are generally fewer hospitals and other healthcare service providers in these communities and generally a lower level of managed care presence in these markets. We believe that communities with smaller populations generally view the local hospital as an integral part of the community and support less direct competition for hospital-based services. Since 2007, we have substantially increased the size of our business and the number of hospitals we operate through the acquisitions of hospitals from Triad Hospitals, Inc., or Triad, and Health Management Associates, Inc., or HMA. Our growth strategy has also included developing or acquiring select physician practices, physician-owned ancillary service providers and other outpatient capabilities in markets where we already had a hospital presence. More recently, our efforts have focused on creating regional networks in select urban markets. We believe opportunities exist for skilled, disciplined operators to create networks between urban and non-urban hospitals while improving physician alignment in both markets and making the hospitals more attractive to managed care. 
 We have been implementing a portfolio rationalization and deleveraging strategy by divesting hospitals and non-hospital businesses that are attractive to strategic and other buyers. Generally, these businesses are not in one of our strategically beneficial service areas, are less complementary to our business strategy and/or have lower operating margins. More recently, in connection with our announced divestiture initiative, strategic buyers have made offers to buy certain of our assets. Through consideration of these offers we have divested or may divest hospitals and non-hospital businesses when we find such offers to be attractive and in line with our operating strategy. In addition, we expect to return to our acquisition strategy when our portfolio rationalization and deleveraging strategy has been sufficiently completed.

On January 27, 2014, we completed the acquisition of HMA for approximately $7.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $3.8 billion of indebtedness, which is referred to in this report as the HMA merger. Additional details regarding the HMA merger are set forth in the Executive Overview section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 On April 29, 2016, we completed a spin-off of 38 hospitals and Quorum Health Resources, LLC, or QHR (our subsidiary through which we provided management advisory and consulting services to non-affiliated general acute care hospitals located throughout the United States), into Quorum Health Corporation, or QHC, and distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of QHC common stock to our stockholders of record as of April 22, 2016. These stockholders received one share of QHC common stock for every four shares of our common stock held as of the record date plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The transaction was structured to be generally tax free to us and our stockholders. In recognition of the spin-off, we recorded a non-cash dividend of approximately $713 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, representing the net assets of QHC distributed to our stockholders. Following the spin-off, QHC became an independent public company with its common stock listed for trading under the symbol QHC on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial and statistical data reported in this Form 10-K include QHC operating results through the spin-off date. Same-store operating results and statistical data exclude information for the hospitals divested in the spin-off of QHC in the years ended December 31, 2016, and for the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014. 
 In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements with QHC on April 29, 2016. These agreements allocate between QHC and us the various assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) that comprise the separate companies and govern certain relationships between, and activities of, QHC and us for a period of time after the spin-off. 
 Throughout this Form 10-K, we refer to Community Health Systems, Inc., or the Parent Company, and its consolidated subsidiaries in a simplified manner and on a collective basis, using words like we, our, us and the Company. This drafting style is suggested by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and is not meant to indicate that the publicly-traded Parent Company or any particular subsidiary of the Parent Company owns or operates any asset, business or property. The hospitals, operations and businesses described in this filing are owned and operated, and management services provided, by distinct and indirect subsidiaries of Community Health Systems, Inc. 
 As initially disclosed on September 19, 2016, with the assistance of advisors, we are exploring a variety of options with financial sponsors, as well as other potential alternatives. These discussions are ongoing. There can be no certainty that the exploration will result in any kind of transaction. We do not expect to make further public comment regarding these matters while the exploration process takes place unless and until we otherwise deem further public comment is appropriate or required. 
 In addition, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement on October 3, 2016. The Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement will not prevent our takeover, but may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of our common stock, which may inhibit or render more difficult a merger, tender offer or other business combination involving us that is not supported by our Board of Directors. The Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement will expire on April 1, 2017.

 Our Business Strategy 
 Our objective is to increase shareholder value by providing high-quality patient care using cost effective and efficient operations. The key elements of our business strategy to achieve this objective are to: 

 | expand and strengthen regional networks,
--+-----------------------------------------


 | increase revenue at our facilities,
--+------------------------------------


 | increase productivity and operating efficiency,
--+------------------------------------------------


 | improve patient safety and quality of care,
--+--------------------------------------------


 | rationalize our portfolio through divestitures of hospitals and non-hospital businesses, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | grow through selective acquisitions.
--+-------------------------------------

Expand and Strengthen Regional Networks 
 We believe opportunities exist in select urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals in order to expand the breadth of services offerings in the non-urban hospitals while improving alignment in these markets and making them more attractive to managed care. 
 Currently, 74 of our hospitals operate in 11 unique regional networks, which are comprised of one or more larger hospitals with smaller hospitals located in nearby communities. Within each regional network, we leverage the networks brand and local scale to expand our continuum of care, enhance access to our facilities, provide a more integrated service offering and reduce costs through increased operating efficiencies. Additionally, 34 of our hospitals operate in close geographic proximity to one or more of our other hospitals in 13 geographic areas. For these hospitals, we seek to develop or expand similar specialty services and outpatient services as our regional networks to yield high patient and physician satisfaction, improve revenue and gain operational efficiencies. As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that approximately 70% of our facilities are located in regional networks or are in close proximity to another CHS hospital. 
 Increase Revenue at Our Facilities 
 Overview. We are implementing a strategy to expand and rationalize service lines. We believe this focused, service line strategy facilitates better capital allocation, and drives volume, acuity and rate growth in desirable areas. In addition, we are expanding the medical services we provide through the recruitment of additional primary care physicians and specialists. We also work with local hospital boards, management teams and medical staffs to determine the number and type of additional physician specialties needed. In recent years, we have built through acquisitions and consolidation several major networks of affiliated hospitals in key states in which we operate. We believe these hospital networks allow us to provide more integrated services and maximize the usage of our strong physician base.

Our initiatives to increase revenue include: 
 

 | recruiting and/or employing additional primary care physicians and specialists,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanding patient access points and the breadth of services offered at our hospitals, our affiliated businesses and in the communities in which we operate, through targeted capital expenditures and physician alignment to support the addition of more convenient or complex services, including orthopedics, cardiovascular services, urology and urgent care,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | providing the capital to invest in technology and the physical plant at our facilities, particularly in our emergency rooms, surgery departments, critical care departments and in diagnostic services, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | executing select managed care contracts through a centrally managed review process.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Physician Recruiting. The primary method of adding or expanding medical services is the recruitment of new primary care physicians and specialists into the community. A core group of primary care physicians is necessary as an initial contact point for all local healthcare. The addition of specialists who offer services, including general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, cardiovascular services, orthopedics and urology, completes the full range of medical and surgical services required to meet a communitys core healthcare needs. At the time we acquire a hospital, and from time to time thereafter, we identify the healthcare needs of the community in which such hospital is located by analyzing demographic data and patient referral trends. As a result of this analysis, we are able to determine what we believe to be the optimum mix of primary care physicians and specialists. We employ recruiters at the corporate level to support the local hospital managers in their recruitment efforts. In some markets, we employ physicians, often acquiring their practice at the onset of the arrangement. We have increased the number of physicians affiliated with us through our recruiting and employment efforts. The percentage of recruited or employed physicians commencing practice with us that were specialists was over 70% in 2016. However, most of the physicians in our communities remain in private practice and are not our employees. We believe we have been successful in recruiting and employing physicians because of the practice opportunities afforded physicians in our markets, as well as lower managed care penetration as compared to larger urban areas. 
 Expansion of Services and Capital Investment. In an effort to better meet the healthcare needs of the communities we serve and to capture a greater portion of the healthcare spending in our markets, we have added a broad range of services to our facilities and, in certain markets, acquired physician practices to broaden our service offerings. These services range from various types of diagnostic equipment capabilities to additional and renovated emergency rooms, surgical and critical care suites and specialty services. We have concentrated our focus on expanding our service lines to those service offerings that we believe have the greatest growth potential, including orthopedics, neuroscience, cardiovascular care, womens health and cancer care. We have been able to expand these service lines through providing additional access points separate from the traditional hospital service location, the maximization of physician practice utilization, creation of free-standing emergency departments, joint venture partnerships with third-party urgent care, diagnostic, imaging and other retail service locations, expansion of outside diagnostic and surgery center locations, and advancing tele-health strategies. Focused initiatives in these areas are intended to provide quicker access to care in a lower cost setting, increase the number of patient transfer centers to better coordinate care, and implement digital health solutions to improve patient engagement and satisfaction. Some of these initiatives include: 

 | expanding our orthopedic program and creating a more standardized process of orthopedic care;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanding and renovating existing emergency rooms to improve service and reduce waiting times;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increasing the number of patient transfer centers to better coordinate care among our physicians, hospitals and outpatient centers. Transfer centers enable patients to be transported to facilities that provide the services they need in our hospitals; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 
 

 | leveraging digital tools to create virtual access points and improve our patient and physician experiences. These digital solutions use clinical protocols and analytics to drive patient outreach for scheduling appointments, assist with referral management to keep patients in-network when possible and provide post care follow-up, including treatment plans, health education, prescription reminders and prevention screening. We also have introduced a tool that enables patients to compare pricing for select outpatient services among our facilities and those of competitors in our markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to these initiatives, we believe our investment in expanding our footprint through free-standing emergency departments, ambulatory surgery centers and urgent care centers will generate increased revenues and earnings from businesses with higher growth and operating margins. We believe that appropriate capital investments in our outpatient facilities combined with the development of our service capabilities will increase patient retention while providing an attractive return on investment. 
 We spent approximately $192 million on 93 major construction projects that were completed in 2016. These projects included new emergency rooms, cardiac catheterization laboratories, hospital additions and surgical suites as well as improvements to various diagnostic and other inpatient and outpatient service capabilities. We also employ a small group of clinical consultants at our corporate headquarters to assist the hospitals in their development of surgery, emergency, critical care, cardiovascular and hospitalist services. In addition to spending capital on expanding services at our existing hospitals, we also build replacement facilities in certain markets to better meet the healthcare needs in those communities. In 2015, we completed Grandview Medical Center, a replacement hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Transfer of all operations to this new facility was completed on October 10, 2015. As part of an acquisition in 2012, we agreed to build a replacement hospital in York, Pennsylvania by July 2017. The total cost of the replacement hospital in York, Pennsylvania is estimated to be $125 million. In 2016, we spent $12 million on the construction project related to the York replacement hospital. In 2015, we spent $123 million on construction projects related to the Birmingham and York replacement hospitals. 
 Managed Care Strategy. Managed care continues to grow in the United States as health plans expand service areas and membership in an attempt to control rising medical costs. As we service primarily non-urban markets, we do not have significant relationships with individual managed care organizations, including Medicare Advantage. We have responded to the growth in managed care with a proactive and carefully considered strategy developed specifically for each of our facilities. Our experienced corporate managed care department reviews and approves all managed care contracts, which are organized and monitored using a central database. The primary mission of this department is to select and evaluate appropriate managed care opportunities, manage existing reimbursement arrangements and negotiate increases in reimbursement. Generally, we do not intend to enter into capitated or risk sharing contracts. However, some purchased hospitals have risk sharing contracts at the time we acquire them. We seek to discontinue these contracts to eliminate risk retention related to payment for patient care. We do not believe that we have, at the present time, any risk sharing contracts that would have a material impact on our results of operations. 
Increase Productivity and Operating Efficiency 
 Overview. We focus on improving operating efficiency to enhance our operating margins. We seek to implement cost containment programs and adhere to operating philosophies that focus on standardizing and centralizing our methods of operation and management, including: 

 | monitoring and enhancing productivity of our human resources,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | capitalizing on purchasing efficiencies through the use of company-wide standardized purchasing contracts and terminating or renegotiating specified vendor contracts,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | installing standardized management information systems, resulting in more streamlined clinical operations and more efficient billing and collection procedures, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 
 

 | improving patient safety and optimizing resource allocation through our case and resource management program, which assists in improving clinical care and containing costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, each of our hospital management teams is supported by our centralized operational, reimbursement, regulatory and compliance expertise, as well as by our senior management team that has substantial industry knowledge and a proven track record of operations success in the hospital industry. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each have over 30 years of experience in the healthcare industry and have worked together since 1973. Our five division presidents have each worked at the Company for many years and average 21 years of experience in hospital and division executive roles. Additionally, we have recently made several key external hires to further strengthen our senior management team. 
 Standardization and Centralization.  Our standardization and centralization initiatives encompass nearly every aspect of our business, from developing standard policies and procedures with respect to patient accounting and physician practice management to implementing standard processes to initiate, evaluate and complete construction projects. Our standardization and centralization initiatives are a key element in improving our operating results. 

 | Billing and Collections. We have adopted standard policies and procedures with respect to billing and collections. We have also automated and standardized various components of the collection cycle, including statement and collection letters and the movement of accounts through the collection cycle. Upon completion of an acquisition, our management information systems team converts the hospitals existing information system to our standardized system. This enables us to quickly implement our business controls and cost containment initiatives. Additionally, we have consolidated local billing and collection functions into six centralized business offices and have completed the transition of our hospitals to this new system and have started to benefit from lower patient denials, underpayment recoveries and reduced operating expenses. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Physician Support. We support our newly recruited physicians to enhance their transition into our communities. All newly recruited physicians who enter into contracts with us participate in an online orientation that covers issues related to starting up or joining a practice. For our employed physicians, we are leveraging software solutions that monitor physician practice performance. We have also implemented programs to improve physician workflow, reduce physician turnover, optimize staffing at physician clinics and standardize onboarding processes. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Procurement and Materials Management. We have standardized and centralized our operations with respect to medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals used in our hospitals. We have a participation agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., or HealthTrust, a group purchasing organization, or GPO. HealthTrust contracts with certain vendors who supply a substantial portion of our medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals. The current term of our agreement with HealthTrust expires in January 2018, with automatic renewal terms of one year unless either party terminates by giving notice of non-renewal. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Facilities Management. We have standardized interiors, lighting and furniture programs. We have also implemented a standard process to initiate, evaluate and complete construction projects. Our corporate staff monitors all construction projects, and reviews and pays all construction project invoices. Our initiatives in this area have reduced our construction costs and shortened our project completion times while maintaining the same high level of quality. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other Initiatives. We have also improved efficiency and productivity by implementing standard programs with respect to ancillary services in various areas, including emergency rooms, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging, home care, skilled nursing, centralized outpatient scheduling and health information management. Moreover, we have implemented initiatives intended to realize employee benefit savings on medical benefits, prescription services and high medical claims and to reduce 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 
 

overtime and use of temporary staffing to align with patient admissions. We work to identify and communicate best practices and monitor these improvements throughout the Company.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. We have centralized many of our significant internal controls over financial reporting and standardized those other controls that are performed at our hospital locations. We continuously monitor compliance with and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Case and Resource Management. The primary goal of our case management program is to ensure the delivery of safe, high quality care in an efficient and cost effective manner. The program focuses on: 

 | appropriate management of length of stay consistent with national standards and benchmarks,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reducing unnecessary utilization,
--+----------------------------------


 | developing and implementing operational best practices,
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | discharge planning, and
--+------------------------


 | compliance with all regulatory standards.
--+------------------------------------------

 Our case management program integrates the functions of utilization review, discharge planning, assessment of medical necessity and resource management. Patients are assessed upon presentation to the hospital and throughout their course of care with ongoing reviews. Industry standard criteria are utilized in patient assessments, and discharge plans are adjusted according to patient needs. Cases are monitored to prevent delays in service or unnecessary utilization of resources. When a patient is ready for discharge, a case manager works with the patients attending physician to evaluate and coordinate the patients needs for continued care in the post-acute setting. Each hospital has the support of a physician advisor to act as a liaison to the medical staff and assist with all the activities of the program. 
 Improve Patient Safety and Quality of Care 
 Each of our hospitals is operated by a corporate board of directors that has established a local board of trustees, which includes members of the hospitals medical staff. The board of directors delegates certain matters to the board of trustees, including establishing policies concerning the hospitals medical, professional, and ethical practices, monitoring these practices, and responsibility for ensuring that these practices conform to legally required standards. We maintain quality assurance programs to support and monitor quality of care standards and to meet Medicare and Medicaid accreditation and regulatory requirements. Patient care evaluations and other quality of care assessment activities are reviewed and monitored continuously with comparison to regional and national benchmarks when available. 
 We maintain an emphasis on patient safety, the provision of quality care and improving clinical outcomes. We understand that high levels of quality are only achieved with a company-wide focus that embraces patient, physician and employee satisfaction and continual, systematic clinical improvements. We believe that a focus on continuous improvement yields the best results for patients, reduces risk and improves revenue through achievement of quality measures. We have developed and implemented programs to support and monitor patient safety and quality of care that include: 
 

 | standardized data and benchmarks to monitor hospital performance and quality improvement efforts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | recommended policies and procedures based on the best medical and scientific evidence as well as training on evidence-based tools for improving patient, physician and employee satisfaction;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | leveraging of technology and sharing of evidence-based clinical best practices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 
 

 | training programs for hospital management and clinical staff regarding regulatory and reporting requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | implementation of specific leadership methods and error-prevention tools to create safer care environments for patients and staff.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of these efforts, we have made significant progress in patient safety and clinical quality. 
 In 2011, we established a component patient safety organization, or PSO, which was listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on January 11, 2012. We believe our PSO has assisted, and will continue to assist, us in improving patient safety at our hospitals. The PSO was recertified in 2014 through 2018. 
 Divestiture and Acquisition Strategy 
 Divestiture and Acquisition Criteria. Acquisitions have been a core part of our growth strategy historically. We have been implementing a portfolio rationalization and deleveraging strategy by divesting hospitals and non-hospital businesses that are attractive to strategic and other buyers. Generally, these businesses are not in one of our strategically beneficial service areas, are less complementary to our business strategy and/or have lower operating margins. In addition to the spin-off of the 38 facilities to QHC which was completed in April 2016 as noted above, in 2016 we divested two facilities and an 80% ownership interest in our home care division, which, as of December 31, 2016, owned and operated 74 licensed home care agencies and 15 licensed hospice agencies. For additional information regarding potential additional dispositions, see the Executive Overview of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 Although we are not actively pursuing hospital acquisition opportunities at this time, we have continued to invest capital strategically in selected physician practice and ancillary service locations that will enhance the service lines and patient access points for our existing hospitals. We intend to focus again on hospital acquisitions once our portfolio rationalization has been sufficiently completed, and, at that time return to a disciplined and targeted approach to hospital acquisitions and seek opportunities that are complementary to our existing markets or represent new markets that fit our operating criteria. At that time, we may pursue acquisition candidates that: 
 

 | are located in a market that has a stable or growing population base,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | are the sole or primary provider of acute care services in the community,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | are located in an area with the potential for service expansion,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | are not located in an area that is dependent upon a single employer or industry, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | have financial performance that we believe will benefit from our managements operating skills.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2016 we acquired three hospitals located in Fayetteville, Arkansas; La Porte, Indiana and Knox, Indiana. We believe that our access to capital, reputation for providing quality care and ability to recruit physicians makes us an attractive partner for these communities. No hospital acquisitions closed during 2015. 
 On January 27, 2014, we completed the merger with HMA, which at the time of acquisition owned or leased 71 hospitals. In addition to the HMA hospitals, during 2014 we acquired four other hospitals located in Ocala, Florida; Sharon, Pennsylvania; Natchez, Mississippi; and Gaffney, South Carolina. 
 Acquisition Efforts. A key part of our strategy has involved establishing a broader presence in our states and markets of operation and expanding and strengthening our regional networks where appropriate. Apart from our 
 
8 
 
 acquisition of Triad hospitals in 2007 and HMA in 2014, most of the hospitals that we have acquired have been municipal or other not-for-profit hospitals. We believe that our access to capital, ability to recruit physicians and reputation for providing quality care make us an attractive partner for these communities. In addition, we have found that communities located in states where we already operate a hospital are more receptive to our acquiring their hospitals, because they are aware of our operating track record with respect to our other hospitals within the state. 
 At the time we have acquired a hospital, we may commit to an amount of capital expenditures, such as a replacement facility, renovations, or equipment over a specified period of time. 
 Pursuant to a hospital purchase agreement in effect as of December 31, 2016, we have committed to build replacement facilities in both La Porte, Indiana and Knox, Indiana by March 2021. Construction costs, including equipment costs, for the La Porte and Knox replacement facilities are currently estimated to be approximately $125 million and $15 million, respectively. No costs have been incurred to date on those facilities. Additionally, we are required to build a replacement facility in York, Pennsylvania by July 2017. Estimated construction costs, including equipment costs, are approximately $125 million for this replacement facility, of which approximately $17 million has been incurred to date. Under other purchase agreements in effect as of December 31, 2016, we have committed to spend $464 million, generally over a five to seven year period after acquisition, for costs such as capital improvements, equipment, selected leases and physician recruiting. Through December 31, 2016, we have incurred approximately $209 million related to these commitments. 
 Industry Overview 
 According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, national healthcare expenditures in 2016 are projected to have grown 4.8% to approximately $3.4 trillion. In addition, these CMS projections, published 2017, indicate that total U.S. healthcare spending will grow at an average annual rate of 5.9% for 2018 through 2019 and by an average of 5.8% annually from 2020 through 2025. However, these projections do not take into account initiatives, programs or other developments that may result from the 2016 federal elections, including any potential significant modifications to or repeal of the Affordable Care Act. CMS also projected that total U.S. healthcare annual expenditures will exceed $5.5 trillion by 2025, accounting for approximately 19.9% of the total U.S. gross domestic product. CMS expects healthcare spending to be largely influenced by changes in economic growth and population aging, and anticipates faster growth in medical prices. 
 Hospital services, the market within the healthcare industry in which we primarily operate, is the largest single category of healthcare expenditures. In 2016, hospital care expenditures are projected to have grown 4.9%, amounting to over $1 trillion. CMS estimates that the hospital services category will exceed $1.1 trillion in 2017, and projects growth in this category at an average of 5.5% annually from 2016 through 2025. 
 U.S. Hospital Industry. The U.S. hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities that are either public (government owned and operated), not-for-profit private (religious or secular), or for-profit institutions (investor owned). According to the American Hospital Association, there are 4,800 community hospitals in the U.S. which are not-for-profit owned, investor owned, or state or local government owned. Of these hospitals, nearly 40% are located in non-urban communities. We believe that a majority of these hospitals are owned by not-for-profit or governmental entities. These facilities offer a broad range of healthcare services, including internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, OB/GYN and emergency services. In addition, hospitals offer other ancillary services, including psychiatric, diagnostic, rehabilitation, home care and outpatient surgery services. 
 Urban vs. Non-Urban Hospitals. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 19.3% of the U.S. population lives in communities designated as non-urban. In these non-urban communities, hospitals are typically the primary source of healthcare. In many cases a single hospital is the only provider of general healthcare services in these communities.

Factors Affecting Performance. Among the many factors that can influence a hospitals financial and operating performance are: 
 

 | facility size and location,
--+----------------------------


 | facility ownership structure (i.e., tax-exempt or investor owned),
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a facilitys ability to participate in GPOs, and
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | facility payor mix.
--+--------------------

 Patients needing the most complex care are more often served by the larger and/or more specialized urban hospitals. We believe opportunities exist in selected urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals in order to expand the breadth of services offered in the non-urban hospitals while improving physician alignment in those markets and making them more attractive to managed care organizations. 
 Hospital Industry Trends 
 Demographic Trends. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2015, there were approximately 48 million Americans aged 65 or older in the U.S. comprising approximately 14.9% of the total U.S. population. By the year 2030, the number of Americans aged 65 or older is expected to climb to 72 million, or 19.3% of the total population. Due to the increasing life expectancy of Americans, the number of people aged 85 years and older is also expected to increase from 6 million in 2015 to 9 million by the year 2030. This increase in life expectancy will increase demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for innovative, more sophisticated means of delivering those services. Hospitals, as the largest category of care in the healthcare market, will be among those impacted most directly by this increase in demand. Based on data compiled for us, the populations of the service areas where our hospitals are located grew 4.6% from 2011 to 2016 and are expected to grow by 4.3% from 2016 to 2021. The number of people aged 65 or older in these service areas grew by 17.7% from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to grow by 17.4% from 2016 to 2021. People aged 65 or older comprised 17.1% of the total population in our service areas in 2016, yet they could comprise 19.3% of the total population in our service areas by 2021. 
 Consolidation. In addition to our own acquisitions in recent years, consolidation activity in the hospital industry, primarily through mergers and acquisitions involving both for-profit and not-for-profit hospital systems, is continuing. Reasons for this activity include: 

 | ample supply of available capital,
--+-----------------------------------


 | valuation levels,
--+------------------


 | financial performance issues, including challenges associated with changes in reimbursement and collectability of self-pay revenue,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the desire to enhance the local availability of healthcare in the community,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the need and ability to recruit primary care physicians and specialists,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the need to achieve general economies of scale and to gain access to standardized and centralized functions, including favorable supply agreements and access to malpractice coverage,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes to healthcare payment models that emphasize cost-effective delivery of service and quality of outcomes for the entire episode of care, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulatory changes.
--+--------------------

The payor industry is also consolidating and acquiring health services providers in an effort to offer more expansive, competitive programs. 
 Trends in Payment for Healthcare Services. As discussed in more detail in the Government Regulation section of this Form 10-K, the impact of healthcare reform legislation, combined with the growing financial and economic pressures on the healthcare industry, has resulted in challenges to traditional reimbursement trends. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, has encouraged the adoption of new payment models that emphasize cost effective delivery of care and quality of outcomes. Although health insurance coverage has expanded, patients may face higher deductibles and increased co-payment requirements, which may result in greater write-offs of uncollectible amounts from those patients. 
 Shift to Outpatient Services. Because of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient healthcare facilities and the increase in the services that are able to be provided at these locations, many individuals are seeking a broader range of services at outpatient facilities. This trend has contributed to an increase in outpatient services while inhibiting the growth of inpatient admissions.

(8) | EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which consists of net (loss) income attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to add back net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and to exclude the effect of discontinued operations, loss from early extinguishment of debt, impairment and (gain) loss on sale of business, gain on sale of investments in unconsolidated affiliates, acquisition and integration expenses from the acquisition of HMA, expense incurred related to the spin-off of QHC, expense incurred related to the sale of a majority ownership interest in our home care division, expense related to government and other legal settlements and related costs, and (income) expense from fair value adjustments on the CVR agreement liability accounted for at fair value related to the HMA legal proceedings, and related legal expenses. We have from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of our subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership positions. We believe that it is useful to present Adjusted EBITDA because it adds back the portion of EBITDA attributable to these third-party interests and clarifies for investors our portion of EBITDA generated by continuing

operations. We now report Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance rather than as a liquidity measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to assess the operating performance of our hospital operations and to make decisions on the allocation of resources. Adjusted EBITDA is also used to evaluate the performance of our executive management team and is one of the primary targets used to determine short-term cash incentive compensation. In addition, our management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in assessing our consolidated results of operations and operational performance and in comparing our results of operations between periods. We believe it is useful to provide investors and other users of our financial statements this performance measure to align with how management assesses our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA also is comparable to a similar metric called Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our senior secured credit facility, which is a key component in the determination of our compliance with some of the covenants under our senior secured credit facility (including our ability to service debt and incur capital expenditures), and is used to determine the interest rate and commitment fee payable under the senior secured credit facility (although Adjusted EBITDA does not include all of the adjustments described in the senior secured credit facility). For further discussion of Consolidated EBITDA and how that measure is utilized in the calculation of our debt covenants, see the Capital Resources section of Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating financial performance. We believe such adjustments are appropriate as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Additionally, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 The following table reflects the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, as defined, to net (loss) income attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. stockholders as derived directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):

(9) | Same-store operating results and statistical data exclude information for the hospitals divested in the spin-off of QHC in both the year ended December 31, 2016 and the comparable periods in 2015 and 2014. Same-store operating results include former HMA hospitals for the periods from January 1 through December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as if such hospitals were owned during each of these comparable periods. For all hospitals owned throughout both periods, the same-store operating results and statistical data reflects the indicated periods. The same-store information does not reflect the application of purchase accounting adjustments as if the HMA merger had been completed on January 1, 2014. Therefore, this information is not intended to present pro forma information prepared under the guidelines of Articles 3-05 and 11 of the SEC. However, management believes the information provides investors with useful information about the hospital admissions, adjusted admissions and net operating revenues had the HMA facilities been owned for the indicated periods. This same-store information for the hospitals acquired in the HMA merger for the period from January 1 through December 31, 2014 is non-GAAP financial information and may not be comparable to the information provided for the comparable 2015 period due to the aforementioned purchase accounting adjustments not having been applied. In addition, same-store comparisons exclude our hospitals that have previously been classified as discontinued operations for accounting purposes.

Sources of Revenue 
 We receive payment for healthcare services provided by our hospitals from: 
 

 | the federal Medicare program,
--+------------------------------


 | state Medicaid or similar programs,
--+------------------------------------


 | healthcare insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations or HMOs, preferred provider organizations or PPOs, and other managed care programs, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | patients directly.
--+-------------------

 The following table presents the approximate percentages of operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before provision for bad debts), by payor source for the periods indicated. The data for the years presented are not strictly comparable due to the effect that hospital acquisitions have had on these statistics. 
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
Medicare | | 23.9 | % | | 24.1 | % | 24.7 | %
Medicaid | | 10.5 | | | 11.2 | | 10.8 | 
Managed Care and other third-party payors | | 53.4 | | | 52.4 | | 51.5 | 
Self-pay | | 12.2 | | | 12.3 | | 13.0 | 
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 As reflected above, we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Included in Managed Care and other third-party payors is operating revenues from insurance companies with which we have insurance provider contracts, Medicare managed care, insurance companies for which we do not have insurance provider contracts, workers compensation carriers and non-patient service revenue, such as rental income and cafeteria sales. The Affordable Care Act has increased the number of insured patients, particularly in states that have expanded Medicaid, which, in turn, has reduced the percentage of our revenues from self-pay patients. However, the outcome of the 2016 federal elections has cast considerable uncertainty on the future of the Affordable Care Act, and it is unclear whether the trend of increased coverage will continue. In addition, several private health insurers have withdrawn, or have announced their intent to withdraw, from the health insurance exchanges established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, which may 
 
14 
 
 threaten the stability of those marketplaces. Legislation or regulation resulting from the repeal, replacement or amendment of the Affordable Care Act may result in payment reductions under the Medicare or Medicaid programs that could negatively impact our business. 
 Medicare is a federal program that provides medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal-state funded program, administered by the states, that provides medical benefits to individuals who would otherwise be unable to afford healthcare. All of our hospitals are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services. Amounts received under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than a hospitals customary charges for the services provided. Further, the Affordable Care Act imposes significant reductions in amounts the government pays healthcare providers and Medicare managed care plans. Since a substantial portion of our revenue comes from patients under Medicare and Medicaid programs, our ability to operate our business successfully in the future will depend in large measure on our ability to adapt to changes in these programs. The trend toward increased enrollment in Medicare managed care may adversely affect our operating revenue. 
 In addition to government programs, we are paid by private payors, which include insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs, other managed care companies and employers, and by patients directly. Blue Cross payors are included in the Managed Care and other third-party payors line in the above table. Patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts paid for hospital services by Medicare and Medicaid programs, insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies, but are responsible for services not covered by these programs or plans, as well as for deductibles and co-insurance obligations of their coverage. The amount of these deductibles and co-insurance obligations has increased in recent years. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government or business payors. To further reduce their healthcare costs, an increasing number of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies negotiate discounted fee structures or fixed amounts for hospital services performed, rather than paying healthcare providers the amounts billed, and utilize structures such as narrow networks that restrict the providers that enrollees may utilize. We negotiate discounts with managed care companies, which are typically smaller than discounts under government programs. If an increased number of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies succeed in negotiating discounted fee structures or fixed amounts or if we are unable to participate in managed care networks serving our markets, our results of operations may be negatively affected. There can be no assurance that we will retain our existing reimbursement arrangements or that these third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates they pay for our services. For more information on the payment programs on which our revenues depend, see Payment on page 22. 
 As of December 31, 2016, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and Indiana represented our only areas of significant geographic concentration. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by our hospitals in Florida (which became an area of geographic concentration in 2014 as a result of the HMA merger), as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 14.1% in 2016, 13.6% in 2015 and 13.0% in 2014. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by our hospitals in Texas, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 11.4% in 2016, 11.1% in 2015 and 10.9% in 2014. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by our hospitals in Pennsylvania, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 11.2% in 2016, 10.6% in 2015 and 11.1% in 2014. Operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), generated by our hospitals in Indiana, as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues, were 8.6% in 2016, 7.3% in 2015, and 7.6% in 2014. 
 Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for hospital services provided. Charges and payment rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of service performed and the geographic location of 
 
15 
 
 the hospital. In recent years, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue received from outpatient services. We attribute this increase to: 
 

 | advances in technology, which have permitted us to provide more services on an outpatient basis and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pressure from Medicare or Medicaid programs, insurance companies and managed care plans to reduce the length and number of inpatient hospital stays and to reduce costs by having services provided on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Health care facility operations are also subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in colder weather months. 
 Government Regulation 
 Overview. The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Under these regulations, hospitals must meet requirements to be certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These requirements include those relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures; billing and coding for services; properly handling overpayments; classifications of levels of care provided; preparing and filing of cost reports; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients; maintenance of adequate records; hospital use; rate-setting; compliance with building codes; environmental protection; and privacy and security. There are also extensive laws and regulations governing a hospitals participation in these government programs. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, our hospitals could lose their licenses and we could lose our ability to participate in these government programs. Further, government regulations may change. If that happens, we may have to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services so that our hospitals remain certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in these programs. We believe that our hospitals are currently in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local regulations and standards. We cannot be certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation. 
 Hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities to determine their compliance with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing and certification. All of our hospitals are licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, most of our hospitals are accredited by The Joint Commission. This accreditation indicates that a hospital satisfies the applicable health and administrative standards to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Healthcare Reform. Over the last decade, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increased access to health insurance. The most prominent of these recent efforts, the Affordable Care Act, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed. However, the future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain following the 2016 federal elections. The newly elected presidential administration and certain members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or interpretation but have not yet agreed upon specific proposals for replacement reforms. In addition, a presidential executive order has been signed that directs agencies to minimize economic and regulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act, but it is unclear how this will be implemented. The impact and timing of any potential repeal of or changes to the Affordable Care Act and any alternative provisions on the healthcare industry is unknown. 
 The Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage and increases health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion 
 
16 
 
 and private sector health insurance reforms. Expansion in public program coverage has been driven primarily by adjusting eligibility requirements for Medicaid coverage. A number of states opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. States that have opted out include Florida, Tennessee and Texas, where we operated a significant number of hospitals as of December 31, 2016. Some states that have opted out are evaluating options such as waiver plans to operate an alternative Medicaid expansion plan. 
 We believe that the Affordable Care Act has had a positive impact on net operating revenues and income from continuing operations as the result of the expansion of private sector and Medicaid coverage that has occurred. However, other provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as requirements related to employee health insurance coverage, have increased our operating costs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act has made changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement that could adversely impact the reimbursement we receive under these programs. These changes include reductions to the Medicare annual market basket update for federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update, and reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments. 
 Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing net effect of the Affordable Care Act due to the results of the 2016 federal elections, the possibility of repeal or significant change to the Affordable Care Act following such elections, and other factors, including clarifications and modifications resulting from executive orders, the rule-making process, the outcome of court challenges, the development of agency guidance, whether and how many states ultimately decide to expand Medicaid coverage, the number of uninsured who elect to purchase health insurance coverage and budgetary issues at federal and state levels. 
 Fraud and Abuse Laws. Participation in the Medicare program is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to comply substantially with the requirements for participating in the Medicare program, the hospitals participation may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. Further, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare program if it engages in any of the following acts: 

 | making claims to Medicare for services not provided or misrepresenting actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | paying money to induce the referral of patients where services are reimbursable under a federal health program, or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | paying money to limit or reduce the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Any person or entity that knowingly and willfully defrauds or attempts to defraud a healthcare benefit program, including private healthcare plans, may be subject to fines, imprisonment or both. Additionally, any person or entity that knowingly and willfully falsifies or conceals a material fact or makes any material false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery or payment of healthcare services by a healthcare benefit plan is subject to a fine, imprisonment or both. 
 A section of the Social Security Act, known as the anti-kickback statute prohibits some business practices and relationships under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. These practices include the payment, receipt, offer, or solicitation of remuneration of any kind in exchange for items or services that are reimbursed under most federal or state healthcare programs. 
 The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, is responsible for identifying and investigating fraud and abuse activities in federal healthcare programs. As part of its duties, the OIG provides guidance to healthcare providers by identifying types of activities that could violate the anti-kickback statute. The OIG also publishes regulations outlining activities and business relationships that would be deemed not to violate the anti-kickback statute. These regulations are known as safe harbor regulations. The 
 
17 
 
 failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not necessarily mean that the activity violates the anti-kickback statute; however, such failure may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 
 The OIG has identified the following incentive arrangements as potential violations of the anti-kickback statute: 
 

 | payment of any incentive by the hospital when a physician refers a patient to the hospital,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment for physicians in facilities usually located close to the hospital,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing, or other staff services,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | free training for a physicians office staff, including management and laboratory techniques (but excluding compliance training),
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | guarantees which provide that, if the physicians income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of the costs of a physicians travel and expenses for conferences,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of services which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, or payment for services in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | coverage on the hospitals group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value, or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | physician-owned entities (often referred to as physician-owned distributorships, or PODS) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals. Physicians own interests in a number of our facilities. Physicians may also own our stock. We also have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements, including employment contracts, leases, management agreements and professional service agreements. We provide financial incentives to recruit physicians to relocate to communities served by our hospitals. These incentives include relocation, reimbursement for certain direct expenses, income guarantees and, in some cases, loans. Although we strive to comply with the anti-kickback statute, taking into account available guidance including the safe harbor regulations, we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine otherwise. If that happens, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and/or exclusion from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, or other government healthcare programs. Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, civil monetary penalties increased substantially in 2016, were further increased in 2017, and will continue to increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index. 
 The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law. This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their 
 
18 
 
 immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements. These types of referrals are commonly known as self referrals. There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self-referral prohibition. One exception, known as the whole hospital exception, allows a physician to make a referral to a hospital if the physician owns an interest in the entire hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a department of the hospital. Another exception allows a physician to refer patients to a healthcare entity in which the physician has an ownership interest if the entity is located in a rural area, as defined in the statute. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. From time to time, the federal government has issued regulations which interpret the provisions included in the Stark Law. 
 The Affordable Care Act narrowed the whole hospital exception to the Stark Law. The Affordable Care Act permitted existing physician investments in a whole hospital to continue under a grandfather clause if the arrangement satisfies certain requirements and restrictions, but physicians are prohibited, from the time the Affordable Care Act became effective, from increasing the aggregate percentage of their ownership in the hospital. The Affordable Care Act also restricts the ability of existing physician-owned hospitals to expand the capacity of their aggregate licensed beds, operating rooms and procedure rooms. The whole hospital exception also contains additional public disclosure requirements. 
 Taking into account 2017 updates to such penalties, sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $24,253 per claim submitted and exclusion from federal healthcare programs, and a penalty of up to $161,692 for a scheme intended to circumvent the Stark Law prohibitions. These civil monetary penalties will increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index. 
 In addition to the restrictions and disclosure requirements applicable to physician-owned hospitals under the Stark Law, CMS regulations require physician-owned hospitals and their physician owners to disclose certain ownership information to patients. Physician-owned hospitals must disclose their physician ownership in writing to patients and must make a list of their physician owners available upon request. Additionally, each physician owner who is a member of a physician-owned hospitals medical staff must agree, as a condition of continued medical staff membership or admitting privileges, to disclose in writing to all patients whom they refer to the hospital their (or an immediate family members) ownership interest in the hospital. A hospital is considered to be physician-owned if any physician, or an immediate family member of a physician, holds debt, stock or other types of investment in the hospital or in any owner of the hospital, excluding physician ownership through publicly-traded securities that meet certain conditions. If a hospital fails to comply with these regulations, the hospital could lose its Medicare provider agreement and be unable to participate in Medicare. 
 Evolving interpretations of current, or the adoption of new, federal or state laws or regulations could affect many of the arrangements entered into by each of our hospitals. In addition, law enforcement authorities, including the OIG, the courts and Congress are increasing scrutiny of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to improperly pay for patient referrals and/or other business. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. 
 Many states in which we operate have also adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the federal anti-kickback statute or that otherwise prohibit fraud and abuse activities. Many states have also passed self-referral legislation similar to the Stark Law, prohibiting the referral of patients to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship. Often these state laws are broad in scope and may apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure. Little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws. 
 Our operations could be adversely affected by the failure of our arrangements to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law, billing laws and regulations, current state laws or other legislation or regulations in these areas adopted in the future. We are unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at the 
 
19 
 
 federal or state level in any of these areas will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or how they may affect our operations. We are continuing to enter into new financial arrangements with physicians and other providers in a manner structured to comply in all material respects with these laws. We strive to comply with applicable fraud and abuse laws. We cannot assure you, however, that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation. 
 Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws. Another trend affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which can be used to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for service not provided and submitting false cost reports. Further, the FCA covers payments involving federal funds in connection with the health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, if those payments involve any federal funds. Liability under the FCA often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA broadly defines the term knowingly. Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity may constitute knowingly submitting a false claim and result in liability. Among the many other potential bases for liability under the FCA is the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government within 60 days of identifying an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment. Submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government and courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. 
 When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957 and $21,916 for each separate false claim, after taking into account 2017 updates to such penalties. These civil monetary penalties will increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index. Settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe calculation of damages. The FCA also contains qui tam or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. If the government intervenes in the action and prevails, the party filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the action, the whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant generally will not be made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors and agents providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. 
 A number of states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. Federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the FCA. From time to time, companies in the healthcare industry, including ours, may be subject to actions under the FCA or similar state laws. 
 Corporate Practice of Medicine; Fee-Splitting. Some states have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities, including corporations, from employing physicians. Some states also have adopted laws that prohibit direct or indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities. Possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physicians license, civil and criminal penalties and rescission of business arrangements. These laws vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We structure 
 
20 
 
 our arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law. However, we cannot provide assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing these laws will not assert that we, or transactions in which we are involved, are in violation of these laws. These laws may also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations. 
 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act imposes requirements as to the care that must be provided to anyone who comes to facilities providing emergency medical services seeking care before they may be transferred to another facility or otherwise denied care. Sanctions for failing to fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs and civil money penalties. These civil monetary penalties increased significantly in 2016, were further adjusted in 2017, and will be increased annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, the law creates private civil remedies that enable an individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law to sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief. A medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospitals violation of the law also has a similar right. Although we believe that our practices are in compliance with the law, we can give no assurance that governmental officials responsible for enforcing the law will not assert we are in violation of this law. 
 Conversion Legislation. Many states, including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals, have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not-for-profit entities. In other states that do not have specific legislation, the attorneys general have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste. These legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the not-for-profit seller. While these reviews and, in some instances, approval processes can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition, we have not had any significant difficulties or delays in completing the process. There can be no assurance, however, that future actions on the state level will not seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals. If these activities are widespread, they could limit our ability to acquire hospitals. 
 Certificates of Need. The construction of new facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities and the addition of new services at our facilities may be subject to state laws that require prior approval by state regulatory agencies. These CON laws generally require that a state agency determine the public need and give approval prior to the construction or acquisition of facilities or the addition of new services. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 83 hospitals in 12 states that have adopted CON laws for acute care facilities. If we fail to obtain necessary state approval, we will not be able to expand our facilities, complete acquisitions or add new services in these states. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a hospitals licenses. 
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HHS has established electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. All healthcare providers covered by HIPAA were required to transition to updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures, known as ICD-10 code sets, by October 1, 2015. We have transitioned all of our hospitals to the ICD-10 coding system. The Affordable Care Act requires the HHS to adopt standards for additional electronic transactions and to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. 
 As required by HIPAA, HHS has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information and require covered entities, including health plans and most healthcare providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is electronically maintained or transmitted. Certain 
 
21 
 
 provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle identifiable health-related information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of the regulations. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. We have developed and utilize a HIPAA compliance plan as part of our effort to comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements. The privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards. 
 Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. 
 Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in civil penalties of up to $55,910 per violation for a maximum of $1,677,299 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. These penalties will increase annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS is required to perform compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. Our facilities also are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. 
 Payment 
 Medicare. Under the Medicare program, we are paid for inpatient and outpatient services performed by our hospitals. 
 Payments for inpatient acute services are generally made pursuant to a prospective payment system, commonly known as PPS. Under PPS, our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount for each hospital discharge based on the patients diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a diagnosis-related group, commonly known as a DRG, based upon the patients condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. Each DRG is assigned a payment rate using 100% of the national average cost per case and 100% of the severity-adjusted DRG weights. DRG payments are based on national averages and not on charges or costs specific to a hospital. Severity-adjusted DRGs more accurately reflect the costs a hospital incurs for caring for a patient and account more fully for the severity of each patients condition. However, DRG payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. While a hospital generally does not receive payment in addition to a DRG payment, hospitals may qualify for an outlier payment when the relevant patients treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold. 
 The DRG payment rates are adjusted by an update factor on October 1 of each year, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. The index used to adjust the DRG payment rates, known as the market basket index, gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. DRG payment rates were increased by the full market basket index, for the federal fiscal years 2016 and 2017 by 2.4% and 2.7% respectively, subject to certain reductions. For federal fiscal year 2016, the DRG payment rates were reduced by 
 
22 
 
 0.8% for documentation and coding; reduced by 0.5% for the multi-factor productivity adjustment; and reduced by 0.2% in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. There was also a 0.2% downward adjustment to offset projected spending increases associated with admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known as the two midnight rule. For federal fiscal year 2017, the DRG payment rates were reduced by 1.5% for documentation and coding; reduced by 0.3% for the multi-factor productivity adjustment; and reduced by 0.75% in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. There is also a positive 0.8% adjustment to remove the effects of prior adjustments intended to offset projected spending increases associated with the two midnight rule. Under the rule, services to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. A 25% reduction to the market basket index occurs if patient quality data is not submitted, and a reduction of 75% of the market basket index update occurs for hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health records, or EHR, technology without receiving a hardship exception. Future legislation may decrease the rate of increase for DRG payments or even decrease such payment rates, but we are unable to predict the amount of any reduction or the effect that any reduction will have on us. 
 The DRG payment rates are also adjusted to promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. First, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under CMSs value-based purchasing program, while hospitals that do not satisfy certain quality performance standards will receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. The amount collected from the reductions is pooled and used to fund the payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical processes of care and patient satisfaction. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and improvement relative to that hospitals own past performance. Second, hospitals experiencing excess readmissions for conditions designated by CMS within 30 days from the patients date of discharge will receive inpatient payments reduced by an amount determined by comparing that hospitals readmission performance to a risk-adjusted national average. Third, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted hospital acquired condition, or HAC, rates in the previous year will have their total inpatient operating Medicare payments reduced by 1%. HHS has indicated that it will increase its efforts to promote, develop and use alternative payment models such as Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, and bundled payment arrangements. 
 In addition, hospitals may qualify for Medicare disproportionate share payments when their percentage of low income patients exceeds specified regulatory thresholds. A majority of our hospitals qualify to receive Medicare disproportionate share payments. Medicare disproportionate share payments are reduced by 75% and earmarked for an uncompensated care payment pool, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. The uncompensated care pool is further reduced each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the U.S. uninsured population that is under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured, the more the Medicare uncompensated care pool will be reduced. Each eligible hospital is then paid, out of the uncompensated care pool, an amount based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. At this time, we cannot predict an impact for this change. These Medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments as a percentage of operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), were 1.0% and 1.2% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Hospitals may also qualify for Medicaid disproportionate share payments when they qualify under the state established guidelines. These Medicaid disproportionate share payments as a percentage of operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), were 0.3% and 0.4% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 We also receive Medicare reimbursement for outpatient services through a PPS. The outpatient conversion factor was increased 2.4% effective January 1, 2016; however, there was a 0.2% downward adjustment in accordance with the Affordable Care Act, a 0.5% downward productivity adjustment and a 2.0% downward adjustment to address what CMS views as inflated payments for laboratory tests packaged with payments for hospital outpatient services. The outpatient conversion factor was increased 2.7% effective January 1, 2017; 
 
23 
 
 however, there was a 0.75% downward adjustment in accordance with the Affordable Care Act and a 0.3% downward productivity adjustment and other payment adjustments, for an estimated 1.65% increase. Taking into account these and other payment adjustments, CMS estimates the 2017 update will result in a 1.7% increase in outpatient PPS payments to hospitals. For fiscal year 2017, an additional 2.0% reduction applies to hospitals that do not submit required patient quality data. We are complying with this data submission requirement. 
 The Medicare reimbursement discussed above was reduced beginning in 2013 due to the Budget Control Act of 2011 that required across-the-board spending cuts to the federal budget, also known as sequestration. These sequestration cuts included reductions in payments for Medicare and other federally funded healthcare programs, including TRICARE. The cuts began on March 1, 2013, with the sequester-related Medicare reimbursement cuts beginning April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2025. 
 Payment under the Medicare program for physician services is based upon the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, under which CMS has assigned a national relative value unit, or RVU, to most medical procedures and services that reflects the resources required to provide the services relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of the time and intensity of work required, overhead expense attributable to the service, and malpractice insurance expense. These elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. MACRA provides for a 0.5% update to the MPFS for each calendar year through 2019. MACRA also requires the establishment of the Quality Payment Program, or QPP, a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other healthcare clinicians are required to participate in one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in 2017 will affect Medicare payments in 2019. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as QPP evolves. Under the Advanced Alternative Payment Model, or Advanced APM, track, incentive payments are available based on participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. Providers may earn a Medicare incentive payment and will be exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, if the provider has sufficient participation in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track, under which physicians will receive performance-based payment incentives or payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of EHR. MIPS will consolidate components of certain existing physician incentive programs. 
 In addition to changing Medicare physician payment methodology, MACRA extended the Medicare Inpatient Low Volume payment and Medicare Dependent Hospital programs to qualifying hospitals through September 30, 2017. If additional legislation is not passed to extend these Medicare hospital payment programs, we could experience a reduction in future reimbursement. 
 Medicaid. Most state Medicaid payments are made under a PPS or under programs which negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid is funded jointly by state and federal government. The federal government and many states are currently considering significantly reducing Medicaid funding, while at the same time expanding Medicaid benefits. Currently, several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs for the purpose of providing reimbursement to providers to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and are funded with a combination of state and federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the providers. Similar programs are also being considered by other states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid funding will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Further, the Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to treat HACs. 
 TRICARE. TRICARE is the Department of Defenses healthcare program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE generally reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. 
 
24 
 
Annual Cost Reports. Hospitals participating in the Medicare and some Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet specified financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers can appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit. DRG outlier payments have been and continue to be the subject of CMS audit and adjustment. The OIG is also actively engaged in audits and investigations into alleged abuses of the DRG outlier payment system. 
 Commercial Insurance and Managed Care Companies. Our hospitals provide services to individuals covered by private healthcare insurance or by health plans administered by managed care companies. These payors pay our hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policyholders based upon the hospitals established charges and the coverage provided in the insurance policy. They try to limit the costs of hospital services by negotiating discounts, including PPS, which would reduce payments by commercial insurers or health plans to our hospitals. Commercial insurers and managed care companies also seek to reduce payments to hospitals by establishing payment rules that in effect re-characterize the services ordered by physicians. For example, some payors vigorously review each patients length of stay in the hospital and recharacterize as outpatient all in-patient stays of less than a particular duration (e.g. 24 hours). Reductions in payments for services provided by our hospitals to individuals covered by these payors could adversely affect us. 
 Medicare Administrative Contractors. CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, in 12 jurisdictions. Each MAC is geographically assigned and serves both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. Chain providers had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, and we chose to do so. However, CMS has not converted all of our hospitals to one MAC and currently does not have an established date to accomplish the conversion. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow. 
 Medicare Integrity. CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through review of quality concerns and detection of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations, or QIOs, for example, are groups of physicians and other healthcare quality experts which work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC, program, CMS contracts with RACs nationwide to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, as required by statute. RACs review claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity. Compensation for RACs is on a contingency basis and based upon the amount of overpayments and underpayments identified, if any. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each providers claim denial rate for the previous year. 
 The RAC programs scope also includes Medicaid claims. States may coordinate with Medicaid RACs regarding recoupment of overpayments and refer suspected fraud and abuse to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Under the Medicaid Integrity Program, CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors, or MICs, to perform reviews and post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. MICs are assigned to five geographic jurisdictions. Besides MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. 
 We maintain policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at 
 
25 
 
 appropriate appeal levels. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. According to the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, the average processing time in fiscal year 2016 was nearly two and a half years. HHS has finalized rules intended to streamline the process and improve efficiency, but has also stressed the need for additional funding. Thus, we may experience significant delays in appealing any RAC payment denials. To ease the backlog of appeals, CMS has made available an administrative settlement process for disputed claims, offering to pay 66% of the net allowable amount in exchange for a hospitals withdrawal of all medical claims appealed. We are participating in this settlement process. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 Accountable Care Organizations. With the aim of reducing healthcare costs by improving quality and operational efficiency, ACOs are gaining traction in both the public and private sectors. An ACO is a network of providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) which work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program that seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of ACO programs. Certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. 
 Bundled Payment Initiatives. The CMS Innovation Center is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while maintaining or improving quality of care. For example, providers participating in bundled payment initiatives accept accountability for costs and quality of care by agreeing to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a certain amount, bundled payment models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. The CMS Innovation Center has implemented a voluntary bundled payment program known as the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement, or BPCI, initiative. We are participating in BPCI initiatives in eleven of our markets. More recently, the CMS Innovation Center has established mandatory bundled payment programs for hospitals in selected geographic areas, including some of our hospitals. These mandatory initiatives focus on orthopedic and cardiac care. 
Supply Contracts 
 In March 2005, we began purchasing items, primarily medical supplies, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, under an agreement with HealthTrust, a GPO in which we are a noncontrolling partner. As of December 31, 2016, we had a 23.1% ownership interest in HealthTrust. By participating in this organization, we are able to procure items at competitively priced rates for our hospitals. There can be no assurance that our arrangement with HealthTrust will continue to provide the discounts that we have historically received. 
Competition 
 The hospital industry is highly competitive. An important part of our business strategy is to continue to acquire hospitals in non-urban markets and selected urban markets. However, other for-profit hospital companies and not-for-profit hospital systems generally attempt to acquire the same type of hospitals as we do. In addition, some hospitals are sold through an auction process, which may result in higher purchase prices than we believe are reasonable. 
 In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions, we must also compete with other hospitals and healthcare providers for patients. The competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients 
 
26 
 
 has intensified in recent years. The majority of our hospitals are located in non-urban service areas in which we are the sole provider of general acute care health services. Those hospitals in non-urban service areas face no direct competition because there are no other hospitals in their primary service areas. However, these hospitals face competition from hospitals outside of their primary service area, including hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services. Patients in those service areas may travel to these other hospitals for a variety of reasons, including the need for services we do not offer or physician referrals. Patients who are required to seek services from these other hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for services we do provide. Those hospitals in selected urban service areas may face competition from hospitals that are more established than our hospitals. Certain of these competing facilities offer services, including extensive medical research and medical education programs, which are not offered by our facilities. In addition, in certain markets where we operate, there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at our hospitals. We also face competition from other specialized care providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers. Some competitors are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups, and participating in ACOs, or other clinical integration models. We believe that we will continue to face increased competition in outpatient service models that become more integrated through acquisitions or partnerships between physicians, specialized care providers, and managed care payors. 
 In most markets in which we are not the sole provider of general acute care health services, our primary competitor is a not-for-profit hospital. These hospitals are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. These hospitals do not pay income or property taxes, and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position such hospitals to maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and offer services more specialized than those available at our hospitals. 
 The number and quality of the physicians on a hospitals staff is an important factor in a hospitals competitive position. Physicians decide whether a patient is admitted to the hospital and the procedures to be performed. Admitting physicians may be on the medical staffs of other hospitals in addition to those of our hospitals. We attempt to attract our physicians patients to our hospitals by offering quality services and facilities, convenient locations and state-of-the-art equipment. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and other future trends toward clinical transparency may have a potential impact on our competitive position and patient volumes in ways that we are unable to predict. In addition, hospitals must either make public a list of their standard charges, or their policies for allowing the public to view a list of these charges in response to an inquiry. 
 Compliance Program 
 We take an operations team approach to compliance and utilize corporate experts for program design efforts and facility leaders for employee-level implementation. We believe compliance is another area that demonstrates our utilization of standardization and centralization techniques and initiatives which yield efficiencies and consistency throughout our facilities. We recognize that our compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on individual employee actions as well as company operations. Our approach focuses on integrating compliance responsibilities with operational functions. This approach is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business. 
 Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1997. Currently, the programs elements include leadership, management and oversight at the highest levels, a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the programs policies. 
 The compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industrys expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing 
 
27 
 
 and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Included within these functional areas are materials and activities for business sub-units, including laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency, surgery, observation, home care, skilled nursing and clinics. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, emergency department treatment and transfer requirements and other patient disposition issues, are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements and review and audit. Another focus of the program is the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security. 
 We have a Code of Conduct which applies to all directors, officers, employees and consultants, and a confidential disclosure program to enhance the statement of ethical responsibility expected of our employees and business associates who work in the accounting, financial reporting and asset management areas of our Company. Our Code of Conduct is posted on our website at www.chs.net/company-overview/code-of-conduct. 
 Corporate Integrity Agreement 
 On August 4, 2014, we announced that we had entered into a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies and identified relators that concluded previously announced investigations and litigation related to short stay admissions through emergency departments at certain of our affiliated hospitals. See the Legal Proceedings discussion in Part II, Item 1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2014 for further discussion of the background of this matter and details of the settlement. In addition to the amounts paid in the settlement, we executed a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA, with the OIG that has been incorporated into our existing and comprehensive compliance program. 
 The compliance measures and reporting and auditing requirements contained in the CIA include: 
 

 | continuing the duties and activities of our Corporate Compliance Officer, Corporate Compliance Work Group, and Facility Compliance Officers and committees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintaining our written Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to full compliance with all statutes, regulations, and guidelines applicable to federal healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintaining our written policies and procedures addressing the operation of our Compliance Program, including adherence to medical necessity and admissions standards for inpatient hospital stays;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continuing our general compliance training;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | providing specific training for appropriate personnel on billing, case management and clinical documentation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | engaging an independent third party to perform an annual review of our compliance with the CIA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continuing our Confidential Disclosure Program and hotline to enable employees or others to disclose issues or questions regarding possible inappropriate policies or behavior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhancing our screening program to ensure that we do not hire or engage employees or contractors who are ineligible persons for federal healthcare programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reporting any material deficiency which resulted in an overpayment to us by a federal healthcare program; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
28 
 

 | submitting annual reports to the OIG which describe in detail the operations of our corporate Compliance Program for the past year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Material, uncorrected violations of the CIA could lead to our suspension or disbarment from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs and repayment obligations. In addition, we are subject to possible civil penalties for failure to substantially comply with the terms of the CIA, including stipulated penalties ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 per day. We are also subject to a stipulated penalty of $50,000 for each false certification made by us or on our behalf in connection with reports required under the CIA. The CIA increases the amount of information we must provide to the federal government regarding our healthcare practices and our compliance with federal regulations. The reports we provide in connection with the CIA could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities. We believe our existing Compliance Program addresses compliance with the operational terms of the CIA. 
 Employees and Medical Staff 
 At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 120,000 employees, including approximately 24,000 part-time employees. References herein to employees refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2016, certain employees at 23 of our hospitals are represented by various labor unions. It is likely that union organizing efforts will take place at additional hospitals in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. 
 Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospitals medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. 
 We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the National Labor Relations Boards pending modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase significantly. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios. 
 Professional Liability Claims 
 As part of our business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To cover claims arising out of the operations of hospitals, we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance on a claims made basis in excess of those amounts for which we are self-insured, in amounts we believe to be sufficient for our operations. We also maintain umbrella liability coverage for claims which, due to their nature or amount, are not covered by our other insurance policies. 
 
29 
 
 However, our insurance coverage does not cover all claims against us or may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance. For a further discussion of our insurance coverage, see our discussion of professional liability claims in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, including medical and pharmaceutical waste products. We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on us. It is possible, however, that environmental issues may arise in the future which we cannot now predict. 
 We are insured for damages of personal property or environmental injury arising out of environmental impairment for both above ground and underground storage tank issues under one insurance policy for all of our hospitals. Our policy coverage is $5 million per occurrence with a $50,000 deductible and a $20 million annual aggregate. This policy also provides pollution legal liability coverage.
