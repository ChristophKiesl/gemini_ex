Item 1. Business 
THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS GENERALLY 

SPAR Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1995 ("SGRP"),and its subsidiaries (together with SGRP, the "SPAR Group" or the "Company"), is a diversified international merchandising and marketing services company and provides a broad array of services worldwide to help companies improve their sales, operating efficiency and profits at retail locations. The Company provides its merchandising and other marketing services to manufacturers, distributors and retailers worldwide, primarily in mass merchandise, office supply, grocery, drug, dollar, independent, convenience, toy, home improvement, and electronics stores. The Company also provides furniture and other product assembly services in stores, homes and offices. The Company has supplied these services in the United States since certain of its predecessors were formed in 1979 and internationally since the Company acquired its first international subsidiary in Japan in May 2001. The Company currently does business in 10 countries that encompass approximately 50% of the total world population through its operations in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey.
 
Merchandising services primarily consist of regularly scheduled, special project and other product services provided at the store level, and the Company may be engaged by either the retailer or the manufacturer. Those services may include restocking and adding new products, removing spoiled or outdated products, resetting categories on the shelf in accordance with client or store schematics, confirming and replacing shelf tags, setting new sale or promotional product displays and advertising, replenishing kiosks, demonstrating or promoting a product, providing on-site audit and in-store event staffing services and providing product assembly services in stores, homes and offices. Other merchandising services include whole store or departmental product sets or resets, including new store openings, new product launches and in-store demonstrations, special seasonal or promotional merchandising, focused product support and product recalls. The Company continues to seek to expand its merchandising, assembly and marketing services business throughout the world.

An Overview of the Merchandising and Marketing Services Industry:
 
The merchandising and marketing services industry includes manufacturers, retailers, brokers, distributors and professional service merchandising companies. Merchandising services primarily involve placing orders, shelf maintenance, display placement, reconfiguring products on store shelves and replenishing product inventory. Additional marketing services include but are not limited to new store sets and remodels, audits, sales assist, installation and assembly, product demos/sampling, promotion and various others. The Company believes that merchandising and marketing services add value to retailers, manufacturers and other businesses and enhance sales by making a product more visible and more available to consumers. 
 
The primary place to carry out merchandising continues to be in physical retail outlets. According to a 2015 Frost & Sullivan report, by 2025 physical stores will still represent 81% of $23 trillion in global retail sales, which translates to $7 trillion in dollar growth over the next 10-year period. 
 
Historically, retailers staffed their stores as needed to provide these services to ensure that manufacturers' inventory levels, the advantageous display of new items on shelves, and the maintenance of shelf schematics and product placement were properly merchandised. However retailers, in an effort to improve their margins, have decreased their own store personnel and increased their reliance on manufacturers to perform such services. At one time, manufacturers attempted to satisfy the need for merchandising and marketing services in retail stores by utilizing their own sales representatives. Additionally, retailers also used their own employees to merchandise their stores to satisfy their own merchandising needs. However, both manufacturers and retailers discovered that using their own sales representatives and employees for this purpose was expensive and inefficient. In addition, the changing retail environment, driven by the rise of digital and mobile technology, is fostering even more challenges to the labor model of retailers and manufacturers. These challenges include increased consumer demand for more interaction and engagement with retail sales associates, stores remodels to accommodate more technology, installation and continual maintenance of in-store digital and mobile technology, in-store pick-up and fulfillment of online orders and increased inventory management to reduce out-of-stocks from omnichannel shopping. 
 
Most manufacturers and retailers have been, and SPAR Group believes they will continue, outsourcing their merchandising and marketing service needs to third parties capable of operating at a lower cost by (among other things) serving multiple manufacturers simultaneously. The Company also believes that it is well positioned, as a domestic and international merchandising and marketing services company, to provide these services to retailers, manufacturers and other businesses around the world more effectively and efficiently than other available alternatives.

Another significant trend impacting the merchandising and marketing services business is the continued preference of consumers to shop in stores and their tendency to make product purchase decisions once inside the store. Accordingly, merchandising and marketing services and in-store product promotions have proliferated and diversified. Retailers are continually re-merchandising and re-modeling entire departments and stores in an effort to respond to new product developments and changes in consumer preferences. We estimate that these activities have increased in frequency over the last few years. Both retailers and manufacturers are seeking third party merchandisers to help them meet the increased demand for these labor-intensive services.
 
In addition, the consolidation of many retailers and changing store formats have created opportunities for third party merchandisers when an acquired retailer's stores are converted to the look and format of the acquiring retailer. In many of those cases, stores are completely remodeled and re-merchandised to implement the new store formats. 

  SPAR Group believes the current trend in business toward globalization fits well with its expansion model. As companies expand into foreign markets they will need assistance in merchandising or marketing their products. As evidenced in the United States, retailer and manufacturer sponsored merchandising and marketing programs are both expensive and inefficient. The Company also believes that the difficulties encountered by these programs are only exacerbated by the logistics of operating in foreign markets. This environment has created an opportunity for the Company to exploit its global Internet, mobile and data network based technology (as further described below) and its business model worldwide.
  
The Company's Domestic and International Segments:
 
In order to cultivate and expand the Company's merchandising and marketing services businesses in both domestic and foreign markets and ensure a consistent approach to those businesses worldwide, the Company has historically divided its world focus into two geographic areas, the United States, which is the sales territory for its Domestic Division, and all locations outside the United States, which are the sales territories for its International Division. To that end, the Company also (1) provides to all of its locations its proprietary Internet, digital and mobile based operating, scheduling, tracking and reporting systems (including language translations, ongoing client and financial reports and ongoing IT support), (2) provides and requires all of its locations to comply with the Company's financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, ethics code and other policies, (3) provides accounting and auditing support and tracks and reports certain financial and other information separately for those two divisions, and (4) has management teams in its corporate offices responsible for supporting and monitoring the management, sales, marketing and operations of each of the Company's international subsidiaries and maintaining consistency with the Company's other subsidiaries worldwide.
 
Each of the Company's divisions provides merchandising and other marketing services primarily on behalf of consumer product manufacturers, distributors and retailers at mass merchandise, office supply, grocery, drug, dollar, independent, convenience, toy, home improvement and electronics stores in their respective territories. SPAR Group's clients include the makers and distributors of general merchandise, health and beauty care, consumer goods, home improvement, home entertainment, and food products in their respective territories. 
 
SPAR Group has provided merchandising and other marketing services in the United States since the formation of its predecessor in 1979 and outside the United States since it acquired its first international subsidiary in Japan in May of 2001. The Company currently conducts its business through its domestic and international divisions in 10 territories around the world (listed in the table below) that encompass approximately 50% of the total world population.

The Company's international business, in each territory outside the United States, is conducted through a foreign subsidiary incorporated in its primary territory. The primary territory establishment date (which may include predecessors), the percentage of the Company's equity ownership, and the principal office location for its US (domestic) subsidiaries and each of its foreign (international) subsidiaries is as follows: 
 

Primary Territory | Date Established | SGRP Percentage Ownership | | Principal Office Location
-------------------------+------------------+---------------------------+-----+--------------------------
United States of America | 1979 | | 100 | % | White Plains, New York, United States of America
Japan | May 2001 | | 100 | % | Tokyo, Japan 
Canada | June 2003 | | 100 | % | Vaughan, Ontario, Canada 
South Africa | April 2004 | | 51 | % | Durban, South Africa 
India | April 2004 | | 51 | % | New Delhi, India 
Australia | April 2006 | | 51 | % | Melbourne, Australia 
China | March 2010 | | 51 | % | Shanghai, China 
Mexico | August 2011 | | 51 | % | Mexico City, Mexico 
Turkey | November 2011 | | 51 | % | Istanbul, Turkey 
Brazil1 | September 2016 | | 51 | % | Sao Paolo, Brazil 

 
1     In September 2016, the Company established a new joint venture subsidiary in Brazil, see Note 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Purchase of Interests in Subsidiaries. This new subsidiary purchased stock in two Brazilian companies – New Momentum, Ltda. and New Momentum Servicos Temporarios Ltda.
 
Financial Information about the Company's Domestic and International Segments:
 
The Company provides similar merchandising and marketing services throughout the world, operating within two reportable segments, its Domestic and International Divisions (as described above). The Company tracks and reports certain financial information separately for these two segments using the same metrics. The primary measurement utilized by management is operating profit level, historically the key indicator of long-term growth and profitability, as the Company is focused on reinvesting the operating profits of each of its international subsidiaries back into local markets in an effort to improve its market share and continued expansion efforts. Certain financial information regarding each of the Company's two segments, which includes their respective net revenues and operating income for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and their respective assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, is provided in Note 12 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Segment Information.
The Company's Business Strategies 

As the marketing services industry continues to expand both in the United States and internationally, many large retailers and manufacturers are outsourcing their merchandising and marketing service needs to third-party providers. The Company believes that offering marketing services on a national and global basis will provide it with a competitive advantage. Moreover, the Company believes that successful use of and continuous improvements to a sophisticated technology infrastructure, including the Company's proprietary global Internet, digital and telecommunication-based technological systems (including servers and other hardware) and its logistical, communication, scheduling, tracking, reporting and accounting software and applications (the "Global Technology Systems"), is key to providing clients with a high level of client service while maintaining efficient, lower cost operations. The Global Technology System uses proprietary software and applications of the Company as well as software (including operating system, office, exchange, data base and server programs) licensed and hardware purchased or leased from third parties and Internet and telecommunication services provided by third parties. The Global Technology System can be accessed through the computers or mobile devices of its authorized personnel and clients and allows the Company to communicate with field management, schedule the store-specific field operations more efficiently, receive information, incorporate, quantify the benefits of its services to clients faster, respond to clients' needs quickly and implement client programs rapidly. The Company's objective is to continue to expand international retail merchandising and marketing services by pursuing its operating and growth strategy, as described below. 
Increasing the Company's Sales Efforts: 
 
The Company is seeking to increase revenues by increasing sales to its current clients, as well as establishing long-term relationships with new clients, many of which currently use other merchandising companies for various reasons. In addition to expanding its direct sales efforts, the Company also is working to strengthen the senior executive relationships between the Company and its clients, is executing a marketing plan to expand the Company's presence in media and client channels, and is receiving and responding to an increasing number of requests for proposals ("RFPs") from potential and existing clients. The Company believes its technology, field implementation and other competitive advantages will allow it to capture a larger share of this market over time. However, there can be no assurance that any increased sales will be achieved.

Improving the Company's Operating Efficiencies: 
 
The Company will continue to seek greater operating efficiencies. The Company believes that its existing field force and technology infrastructure can support additional clients and revenue in both its Domestic and International Divisions. 
Developing New Services: 
 
The Company is seeking to increase revenues through the internal development and implementation of new services as well as industry collaborations that add value to its clients' retail merchandising related activities, some of which have been identified and are currently being tested for feasibility and market acceptance. However, there can be no assurance that any new services will be developed or that any such new service can be successfully marketed. 
Leveraging and Improving on the Company's Technological Strengths:

  The Company believes that providing merchandising and marketing services in a timely, accurate and efficient manner, as well as delivering timely, accurate and useful reports to its clients, are key components that are and will continue to be critical to the Company's success. The Company's Global Technology Systems improve the productivity of the Company's merchandising, auditing, assembly and other field personnel (each a "Field Specialist"), and provide timely data to its clients. The Company's Field Specialists use smartphones, tablets, laptops, and personal computers to report (through the Internet or telecommunication network) the status of each store or client product they service into the Company's Global Technology Systems. Field Specialists report on a variety of issues such as store conditions and status of client products (e.g. out of stocks, inventory, display placement) or they may scan and process new orders for certain products. 
 
The Company's Global Technology Systems include an automated labor tracking system for the Company's Field Specialists to communicate work assignment completion information (via the Internet or other telecommunication infrastructure) by using, among other things, smartphones, laptops and personal computers, cellular telephones or landlines. This tracking system enables the Company to report hours and other completion information for each work assignment on a daily basis and provides the Company with daily, detailed tracking of work completion. This information is analyzed and displayed in a variety of reports that can be accessed by both the Company and its clients via a secure website. These reports can depict the reported status of merchandising projects in real-time. This tracking technology also allows the Company to schedule the Company's Field Specialists more efficiently, quickly quantify the status and benefits of its services to clients, rapidly respond to clients' needs and rapidly implement programs. 
 
Industry sources indicate that clients are increasingly relying on merchandising and marketing service providers to supply rapid, value-added information regarding the results of the clients' merchandising and marketing expenditures on sales and profits. The Company intends to continue to utilize its Global Technology Systems to enhance the Company's efficiency and ability to provide real-time data to its clients as reported to the Company, as well as, maximize the speed of communication with logistical deployment of and reporting from the Company's Field Specialists. The Global Technology System can be accessed through the computers or mobile devices of its authorized personnel and clients and allows the Company to communicate with field management, schedule the store-specific field operations more efficiently, receive information, incorporate, quantify the benefits of its services to clients faster, respond to clients' needs quickly and implement client programs rapidly. 
 
The Company believes that it can continue to improve, modify and adapt its technology to support merchandising and other marketing services for additional clients and projects in the United States and in foreign markets. The Company also believes that its Global Technology Systems give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace worldwide. The Company has successfully modified and is currently utilizing certain of its software applications in the operation of its International Division. The Company's Global Technology Systems are developed, operated, managed, maintained, and controlled from the Company's information and technology control center in Auburn Hills, Michigan, U.S.A. The scheduling, tracking and reporting software currently included in the Company's Global Technology Systems were co-developed and are co-owned by the Company and certain of its affiliates and maintained and further developed and improved by the Company at its own expense. See Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, and Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Related Party Transactions - Other Related Party Transactions and Arrangements, below.

Acquisition Strategies and Strategic Acquisitions: 

   The Company is seeking to acquire businesses or make other arrangements with companies that offer similar merchandising or marketing services both in the United States and worldwide. The Company believes that increasing its industry expertise, further developing and refining its technology systems, adding services, and increasing its geographic breadth and local market depth will allow it to service its clients more efficiently and cost effectively. Through such acquisition strategies, the Company may realize additional operating and revenue synergies and may leverage existing relationships with manufacturers, retailers and other businesses to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that any of the acquisition strategies will occur or whether, if completed, the integration of the acquired businesses will be successful or the anticipated efficiencies and cross-selling opportunities will occur. See Item 1 - Business - The Company's Domestic and International Segments, above.
 
One key to the Company's domestic and international expansion strategy is its emphasis on developing, maintaining, improving, deploying and marketing its Global Technology Systems that run on and are developed, managed, maintained and controlled worldwide from the Company's information and technology control center in Auburn Hills, Michigan, U.S.A. The Company's Global Technology Systems are accessible through computers and mobile devices by the local representatives of the Company and its clients in order to enhance local operations, give the Company an important marketing distinction and advantage over its competitors (such as real-time access to field reporting), and provide the Company with a technological means to exercise its supervision and control over its subsidiaries, both domestic and international. The Company provides access to its Global Technology Systems for its worldwide operations through its control center on a real-time basis 24/7/365. In addition, this strategy is strengthened internationally by the Company's internally developed translation software, which allows its current and future programs included in its Global Technology Systems to be available in any language for any market in which it currently operates or desires to enter in the future. See Item 1 - Business - Leveraging and Improving on the Company's Technological Strengths, above, and The Company's Trademarks, below.
 
Another key to the Company's international and domestic expansion is its strategy of seeking a minority (i.e., non-controlling) investor that is experienced (directly or through its principals) in the local area and not otherwise affiliated with the Company (each a "Local Investor") for each new consolidated joint venture subsidiary acquired by the Company. The Company supervision and control over each such consolidated subsidiary is strengthened through its subsidiary documentation and the use of its Global Technology Systems. The Company's supervision and control is further strengthened by its company-wide executive management, administrative support, accounting oversight, procedures and controls (financial and reporting), and corporate codes and policies that apply to each such subsidiary (the Company's "Global Administration", and together with its Global Technology Systems, the Company's "Global Contributions"). The Company also seeks to own a majority (at least 51%) of such a subsidiary's equity while the Local Investor purchases a minority equity interest in it (49% or less). Since 2014 the Company has sought (in the governing documents for each new acquisitions or reorganization) to have a majority of the members of such subsidiary's board of directors, to have all quorums and matters decided by a simple majority of its equity or directors, and to have such subsidiary agree to be bound by the Company's financial and reporting controls and procedures, ethics code, and other corporate codes and policies. In addition to its equity participation, a Local Investor provides certain services and the useful local attention, perspective and relationships of a substantial (although non-controlling) equity owner with a strong financial stake in such subsidiary's success (the "Local Contributions"). The Local Investor also often contributes an existing customer base and a seasoned operating infrastructure as additional Local Contributions to the subsidiary in which it invests. As of the date of this Annual Report, National Merchandising Services, LLC, in the U.S.A. (see below) and each of the Company's international operating subsidiaries (other than those in Canada and Japan) has a Local Investor. See Item 1A - Risk Factors - Potential Conflicts in Services Provided by Affiliates, Risks Associated with International and Domestic Subsidiaries, Risks of Having Material Local Investors in International and Domestic Subsidiaries, Risks Associated with Foreign Currency and Risks Associated with International Business, Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - International Related Party Services and Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in the Brazil Acquisition, Note 2 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Principles of Consolidation, Accounting for Joint Venture Subsidiaries, Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Related Party Transactions - International Related Party Services and Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in the Brazil Acquisition, and Note 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Purchase and Sale of Interests in Subsidiaries, below.
 
In September 2016, the Company, through its subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, SPAR International Ltd., entered into an agreement to purchase the equity shares (called "quotas") in New Momentum Ltda. and New Momentum Serviços Temporários Ltda., each a Brazilian limitada from Interservice Publicidade Sociedade Ltda., a Brazilian limitada, Momentum Promoções Ltda., a Brazilian limitada, and IPG Nederland B.V., a Netherlands company. The Company consolidated its Brazil operations beginning on September 14, 2016. See Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - International Related Party Services and Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in the Brazil Acquisition, Note 10 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Related Party Transactions - International Related Party Services and Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in the Brazil Acquisition, and Note 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Purchase and Sale of Interests in Subsidiaries, below.

Descriptions Of The Company's Services 
 
The Company currently provides a broad array of services to some of the world's leading companies, both domestically and internationally. The Company believes its full-line capabilities provide fully integrated solutions that distinguish the Company from its competitors. These capabilities include the ability to respond to multi-national client RFPs, develop plans at one centralized location, effect chain-wide execution, implement rapid, coordinated responses to its clients' needs and report on a real time basis throughout the world. The Company also believes its international presence, industry-leading technology, centralized decision-making ability, local follow-through, ability to perform large-scale initiatives on short notice, and strong retailer relationships provide the Company with a significant advantage over local, regional or other competitors.

Syndicated Services: 
 
Syndicated services consist of regularly scheduled, routed merchandising and marketing services provided at the retail store level for retailers, manufacturers and distributors. These services are performed for multiple manufacturers and distributors, including, in some cases, manufacturers and distributors whose products are in the same product category. Syndicated services may include activities such as:

Dedicated Services: 
 
Dedicated services consist of merchandising and marketing services, generally as described above, which are performed for a specific retailer or manufacturer by a dedicated organization, sometimes including a management team working exclusively for that retailer or manufacturer. These services include many of the above activities detailed in syndicated services, as well as, new store set-ups, store remodels and fixture installations. These services are primarily based on agreed-upon rates and fixed management fees. 
Project Services: 
 
Project services consist primarily of specific in-store services initiated by retailers and manufacturers, such as new store openings, new product launches, special seasonal or promotional merchandising, focused product support, product recalls, in-store product demonstrations and in-store product sampling.

Assembly Services:
 
The Company's assembly services are initiated by retailers, manufacturers or consumers, and upon request the Company assembles furniture, grills, and many other products in stores, homes and offices. The Company performs ongoing routed coverage at retail locations to ensure that furniture and other product lines are well displayed and maintained, and building any new items or replacement items, as required. In addition, the Company provides in-home and in-office assembly to customers who purchase their product from retailers, whether in store, online or through catalog sales.

The Company's Sales and Marketing 
 
The Company offers global merchandising solutions to clients that have worldwide distribution. This effort is spearheaded out of the Company's headquarters in the United States, and the Company continues to develop local markets through its domestic and international subsidiaries throughout the world. 
 
The Company's marketing and sales efforts within its Domestic Division are structured to develop new national, regional and local business within the United States, including new sales and customers through the Company's acquisitions of existing businesses. The Company's domestic corporate business development team directs its efforts toward the senior management of prospective and existing clients. Marketing and sales targets and strategies are developed at the Company's headquarters and communicated to the Company's domestic sales force for execution. Marketing efforts concentrate on enhancing SPAR's position as an industry leader, promoting its key advantages, strengthening its industry presence and supporting sales. The Company's sales force is located nationwide and works from both the Company's offices and their home offices. In addition, the Company's domestic corporate account executives play an important role in the Company's new business development efforts within its existing manufacturer, distributor and retailer client base. 
 
The Company's marketing and sales efforts within its International Division are structured to develop new national, regional and local businesses in both new and existing international territories by acquiring existing businesses and within the Company's existing international territories through targeted sales efforts. The Company has an international acquisition team whose primary focus is to seek out and develop acquisitions throughout the world. Marketing and sales targets and strategies are developed within an international subsidiary, in consultation with the Company's U.S. headquarters, with assistance from the applicable Local Investor, and are communicated to the Company's applicable international sales force for execution. The Company's international sales force for a particular territory is located throughout that territory and work from the Company's office in that territory and their home offices. In addition, the Company's international corporate account executives play an important role in the Company's new business development efforts within the Company's existing manufacturer, distributor and retailer client base within their respective territories.

As part of the retailer consolidation, retailers are centralizing most administrative functions, including operations, procurement and category management. In response to this centralization and the growing importance of large retailers, many manufacturers have reorganized their selling organizations around a retailer team concept that focuses on a particular retailer. The Company has responded to this emerging trend and currently has on-site personnel in place at select retailers. 
 
The Company's business development process includes a due diligence period to determine the objectives of the prospective or existing client, the work required to satisfy those objectives and the market value of such work to be performed. The Company employs a formal cost development and proposal process that determines the cost of each element of work required to achieve such client's objectives. The Company uses these costs, together with an analysis of market rates, to develop a formal quotation that is then reviewed at various levels within the organization. The pricing of this internal proposal must meet the Company's objectives for profitability, which are established as part of the business planning process. After the Company approves this quotation, a detailed proposal is presented to the Company's prospective or existing client. However, the Company has agreed, and in the future may agree, from time to time to perform services for a client that become or turn out to be unprofitable even though the Company expected to make a profit when agreeing to perform them. See Item 1A – Risk Factors - Risks of Unprofitable Services, Variability of Operating Results and Uncertainty in Client Revenue, and Risks of Losses and Financial Covenant Violations, below.

The Company's Customer Base

The Company currently represents numerous manufacturers and/or retail clients in a wide range of retail chains and stores worldwide, and its customers (which it refers to as clients) include: 

• | Mass Merchandisers 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Drug Stores 
• | Grocery Stores 
• | Office Supply Stores 
• | Dollar Stores 
• | Toy or Specialty Stores 
• | Electronic Stores 
• | Home Improvement Stores 
• | Other retail outlets (such as discount and electronic stores, independents, in-home and in-office, etc.)

 
The Company did not have any clients that represented 10% or more of the Company's net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
The Company's Competition 

   The marketing services industry is highly competitive. The Company's competition in the Domestic Division and International Division arises from a number of large enterprises, many of which are national or international in scope. The Company also competes with a large number of relatively small enterprises with specific client, channel or geographic coverage, as well as with the internal marketing and merchandising operations of its existing and prospective clients. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors within its industry include development and deployment of technology, breadth and quality of client services, cost, the ability to execute specific client priorities rapidly and consistently over a wide geographic area, and the ability to ideate and operate as a retail business partner delivering value above the base services. The Company believes that its current structure favorably addresses these factors and establishes it as a leader in many retailer and manufacturer verticals. The Company also believes it has the ability to execute major national and international in-store initiatives and develop and administer national and international manufacturer programs. Finally, the Company believes that, through the use and continuing improvement of its Global Technology Systems, other technological efficiencies and various cost controls, the Company will remain competitive in its pricing and services. 
The Company's Trademarks 
 
The Company has numerous registered trademarks. Although the Company believes its trademarks may have value, the Company believes its services are sold primarily based on breadth and quality of service, cost, and the ability to execute specific client priorities rapidly, efficiently and consistently over a wide geographic area. The Company's trademarks are generally licensed royalty free to its affiliates, SAS, SBS, and SIT (as defined in Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, below). The scheduling, tracking and reporting software currently included in the Company's Global Technology Systems were co-developed and are co-owned by the Company, SBS and SIT and are maintained and further developed and improved by the Company at its own expense at a cost of $1.3 million in both 2016 and 2015. See "An Overview of the Merchandising and Marketing Services Industry" and "Competition", above, Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence- Other Related Party Transactions and Arrangements, and Note 10 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements - Related Party Transactions - Other Related Party Transactions and Arrangements, below.

The Company's Labor Force 
 
Worldwide the Company utilized a labor force of approximately 18,500 people in 2016. 


During 2016, the Company's Domestic Division employed a labor force of 198 people. As of December 31, 2016, there were 153 full-time employees and 45 part-time employees engaged in domestic operations. The Company's Domestic Division utilized the services of its affiliates, SPAR Business Services, Inc. ("SBS"), to provide substantially all of the field merchandising, auditing, assembly and other field personnel (each a "Field Specialist"), to perform the Company's merchandising, audit, assembly and other services for its domestic clients, and SPAR Administrative Services, Inc. ("SAS"), to schedule, deploy and administer the Field Specialists. SBS furnished approximately 7,000 Field Specialists (all of whom are engaged by SBS) to the Company in 2016. SAS furnished approximately 56 field administrators (all of whom were employed by SAS) to the Company in 2016. The Company, SBS and SAS consider their relations with the SAS employees and the SBS Field Specialists to be good.
