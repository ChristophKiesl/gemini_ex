Our Company 
 We started with a simple question, “What if the best of the retail store experience could come to you?” Over the last eight years, we created, built and optimized the Mobile Store, a new channel that pairs the convenience of online shopping with the personal touch of an in-store retail experience in the comfort of end customer’s (the “Consumer”) homes. We are reinventing the retail experience and commerce-at-home by leveraging innovative technologies, working with leading global telecommunication and technology companies, and developing a passionate and caring workforce. 
 Our mobile retail sales team (“Experts”), led by their managers (“Captains”), provide everything that is provided by a store in the comfort of a home including set-up, activation and demonstration of the products we deliver. We assist Consumers in evaluating and selecting a wide range of accessories, media subscriptions, device protection, broadband and other services. We will also assist in the trade-in and upgrade of products. We strive to deliver products with same-day or next-day frequency. 
 Segments 
 The Company has two reportable segments which are determined by geography: North America and Europe. The North America segment consists of operations within the United States and Canada and the Europe segment currently consists of operations within the United Kingdom. 
Our Customers 
 We have contractual partnerships, commercial relationships and/or authorized dealer agreements with leading telecommunications and technology companies (such arrangements, “Business Partnerships”), including AT&T in the US, BT-EE (British Telecom) in the UK, Rogers in Canada and Apple in select US cities (such companies, “Customers” or “Business Partners”). We provide the commerce-at-home experience to our Business Partners’ Consumers. Enjoy delivers a broad assortment of telecommunications and technology products and accessories for our Business Partners. As of December 31, 2021, our top two Business Partners in the U.S. and the U.K. accounted for 62% and 15% of our revenue, respectively. We expect the percentage of these two Business Partners as a portion of our revenue to decline over time as our partner relationships expand. A loss of or reduction in business from, or consolidation of, these or any other major Business Partners could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial performance and prospects. 
The Problem 
 Over the last two decades, eCommerce has upended the traditional physical retail model, shifting commerce from stores to commerce-at-home. Digital channels brought the shopping experience to the doorstep, enabling customers to buy and receive their purchases without ever having to leave the home. Fulfillment to the door has been made easier and faster than ever with technology companies achieving massive success through last-mile innovations. 
 However, the current eCommerce experience has one fundamental flaw: it ends with a package at the door. Brands lose the personal connection to their customers, their ability to provide in-person advice and support, and their ability to upsell products and services as online retail continues to gain share. Meanwhile, physical stores continue to close worldwide as eCommerce displaces traditional retail. These trends indicate that in the decades to come there is a substantial opportunity to capitalize on the expanded demand for commerce-at-home. This is the power of Enjoy. We are taking the shopping journey through the door by providing a comprehensive experience in the place that matters the most—the home.

  Our Solution 
 It is against this backdrop that we pioneered the Mobile Store, a new channel that combines the convenience of online shopping with the personal touch of an in-store retail experience within the comfort of Consumers’ homes. With the Mobile Store, Enjoy provides a high-touch experience, with the support of a trained Expert, wherever is convenient for Consumers. Our platform is underpinned by highly sophisticated machine-learning technologies, resulting in high customer satisfaction and numerous new revenue opportunities for us and our Business Partners. 
 Our Mobile Stores provide the experience of a traditional physical store, but better. The quality of the retail experience is incredibly important to how Consumers determine overall satisfaction with brands and products. We bring the premium in-store experience and the convenience of online shopping to the home. Throughout the in-home experience, we set up and activate the Consumer’s product and provide a demonstration of key features. We also help Consumers evaluate and purchase a wide range of accessories, media sources, protection plans, broadband and other services, many of which are on a subscription basis. We also assist Consumers in the trade-in and upgrade of products, where applicable. 
 The relationship formed between Consumers and Experts is not limited to this first visit. For some relationships, we offer the opportunity for the same Expert to follow up with the Consumer and return for a second visit. This allows space for final decisions on products or the presence of another person to help finalize a sale that might have been lost in a traditional retail space and could have been lost in a traditional online shopping environment. 
 Smart Last Mile: In the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched Smart Last Mile™ in North America, which provides Enjoy’s Business Partners with an omni-channel solution to enable trusted at-home retail experiences and to-the-door deliveries. With Smart Last Mile™, we expect to have more aggregate inventory, all forward deployed in our network, to address a larger share of our Business Partners’ customer demand. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 Since our inception, we have been developing and leveraging the following key strengths of our robust go-to market strategy, which we believe provide significant competitive advantages. 
 Trusted, embedded Business Partnerships: Our Business Partnerships are with some of the world’s leading consumer companies with a shared commitment to superior customer service. We believe that the fact that some of the world’s most iconic and valuable brands trust Enjoy with their Consumers is a testament to the high standards that we set for service excellence, and a reflection of the unique value that we provide. 
 Full-time Experts: Our team is not a group of contractors or freelancers; they are full-time employees empowered to react to unique circumstances. Our team is passionate about technology and continually focused on delivering world-class service. 
 Proprietary technology platform: Our platform was built from the ground up. Our business is custom-built to deliver millions of unique retail experiences to the home. Our technology stack was built by an experienced, in-house engineering team from top-tier tech companies in Silicon Valley. The end product is a platform that is adaptable to the complexities of our unique business model, making it difficult to replicate. Powered by our proprietary application programming interfaces (APIs), we are integrated with our Business Partners and fully embedded into their online buy-flows as well as select Business Partners’ call centers and stores. 
 Compelling value proposition: We believe that we have found the solution on how to bring the best of the store to the comfort of the home. Our Mobile Store delivers and activates new products for free in the comfort of the home. Not only can Consumers skip the trip to the store, but they can also purchase additional products and services, such as accessories, subscriptions and upgrades, all within a single visit. 
 Unique business model: We believe we invented and optimized a commerce-at-home retail channel through our Smart Last Mile™ platform that addresses specific pain points for our Business Partners and Consumers and enables at-home retail experiences and to-the-door deliveries. We have established Business Partnerships with 
 
5 

premium consumer brands in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, which we believe is extremely difficult to duplicate and allows us to scale across the globe at a near-zero Consumer acquisition cost. 
High growth, scalable, and asset-light: Our warehouses and vehicle fleet are fully leased to reduce capital outlay, and our inventory is 100% consigned, minimizing working capital requirements. We believe this asset-light model, coupled with our existing dynamic technology infrastructure, and our in-place training and onboarding procedures allow us to effectively scale our business. Coupled with strong market dynamics in eCommerce, we believe we have the ability to add new Business Partners, expand our geographic footprint domestically and internationally and grow our market share quickly. Our executive team has experience building, growing, and transforming dynamic growth businesses and we believe this will enable our continued growth for many years. 
Visionary and experienced leadership: Founder and CEO Ron Johnson, alongside Enjoy’s experienced and multidisciplinary leadership team, brings a proven track record, a deep expertise in building businesses through innovation, and a demonstrated ability to execute. Enjoy has a highly experienced team in place to pioneer a new future for Consumer retail experiences. 
Our Technology Platform 
We began designing and developing our proprietary technology stack nearly from inception, as there was no off-the-shelf technology solution that could bring the best of the store through the door of the Consumer. 
We took a clean sheet of paper to reimagine a retail platform, taking the best of traditional retail and making it an entirely mobile experience. Developing the technology needed to enable a personalized experience to every Consumer is a significant challenge. Through years of development by our in-house engineering team, we succeeded in custom building a proprietary platform that is dynamic, intelligent, and adaptable to the complexities of our unique business model. 
Integration Platform: Our Integration Platform enables integration of our experience with each of our Business Partners’ retail and/or sales channels using a combination of real-time APIs and live applications. Customers place orders directly via our Business Partners’ existing retail and/or sales channels by selecting Enjoy at checkout. Orders fulfilled by Enjoy can be directly managed from our Business Partners’ internal systems, including eCommerce, POS and/or CRM. The platform also offers a turn-key, single sign-on live application to easily enable the Enjoy service offering. 
We can implement new B2B (business to business) integrations in weeks by leveraging our pre-build accelerator tools, mappings and integration framework. Our platform manages complexity at scale with feature qualities that have positioned Enjoy for fast global expansion and scale. 
Our core platform is architected with an adaptive design that allows Enjoy to expedite integration changes. Additionally, this architecture minimizes dependence and engineering development costs to our Business Partners. Once our adaptors are plugged into our Business Partners’ systems, we are able to manage most changes on our own, including deploying new features, piloting features in one or more markets and/or running A/B tests. Our platform features are reusable by our Business Partners while also having enough configurability to meet the individual needs of each of our Business Partners and of Enjoy. 
Field Platform: Our Field Platform provides Experts and their Captains a host of tools to help them manage their days. Each step of an Expert’s day is guided with a native mobile app (Expert app) so they can focus on delivering highly personalized experiences to every Consumer. The Field Platform allows us to track in real time where each Expert is, what they are doing, how long the experience is taking, and how effective the experience has been. 
Each Captain gets real-time access to their team of Experts via a field platform app called Live Schedule. With the app, Captains can see live mapping locations, available inventory, and upcoming Consumer visits and 

6 


interests. Live Schedule enables unparalleled visibility in a mobile world. Utilized by leaders across Enjoy, Live Schedule enables us to understand an Expert’s day in real-time. It also drives real-time insights that help our leaders provide coaching and support to Experts in real-time. 
Mobile Inventory Management Platform: Our Mobile Inventory Management Platform provides a real-time warehouse and logistics management application. The platform manages the end-to-end movement of inventory, providing streamlined flows that enable Enjoy fulfillment teams to execute with incredible speed, accuracy, and efficiency. Moreover, our systems use a wealth of data—including demand, scheduling and route planning—to predict and prescribe what inventory to prepare for each visit. Our mobile inventory system will optimize committed inventory and additional inventory for incremental sales and provides insights on availability, routing flexibility, and many other use cases. It also packages the inventory into a pick and pack list that takes fulfillment operators through the warehouse in only one pass. 
Smart Routing and Activity Assignment Algorithm: Our Smart Routing and Activity Assignment Algorithm is a proprietary algorithm that matches Experts and inventory with Consumer orders in real-time. This real-time predictive planning model maximizes daily revenue and provides the best experience for every Consumer’s needs by regularly re-optimizing routes and activities. The model generates routes and activities based on where every Expert is, where and when visits are scheduled, inventory availability, changing traffic conditions, and optimal times for Expert breaks. 
Live Catalog: Live Catalog is a proprietary merchandising platform (and app) available in select visits. It allows Experts to show Consumers all available inventory in the Expert’s vehicle at that moment. Consumers can browse and purchase the available inventory on-the-spot. Consumers gain access to Live Catalog through a text from the Expert or a QR code scan during the visit. In addition, when a Consumer expresses interest in purchasing a product or service that is unavailable in the vehicle but available at the warehouse, we are able to capture this need via Live Catalog and schedule a future follow-up visit for that Consumer, reserving the inventory for that Consumer on-the-spot.
Development Operations Platform: Our technology is hosted on a third-party cloud computing infrastructure that can scale up quickly and efficiently. Our Development Operations Platform provides engineers with access to on-demand staging environments with the push of a button, allowing them to pick their mix of Enjoy-developed applications, features, and databases. This allows our engineers to build prototypes for full-scale major feature releases with alerting, reporting, automated tests, escalations, and feature flagging at the market and individual levels. 
Data Platform: Our proprietary data platform delivers real-time data pipelines from all proprietary and nonproprietary systems. It maintains a central library of our data dictionary and definitions covering all aspects of our business. 
The data platform is designed and built to scale. It leverages a variety of proprietary and commercially available tools to deliver consistent Key Performance Indicators and business performance metrics to all cross-functional teams and individuals within Enjoy. Further, the self-healing data pipeline created to build the underlying data repository and data warehouses ensure consistent and near-real time data insights that keep our stakeholders aligned and focused on priority opportunities. 
Our data platform uses predictive learning models to power rapid experimentation, “what if” scenario simulations, and forecasting, all while enabling our business teams to succeed at scale. 
Strategic Initiatives: We expect to launch several strategic initiatives, including technology changes, to help mitigate future inventory challenges. Most importantly, we expect to have the ability to take future orders without currently possessing inventory just in time for the Fall 2022 new product introductions. 
Competition 
The commerce-at-home experience represents a shift in the traditional retail model by bringing a personalized, convenient retail experience through the door and into the comfort of Consumers’ homes. We believe that our differentiated model limits the number of direct competitors. As such, rather than direct competitors, we have 

7 


indirect competitors in related service industries that compete with us for the time and attention of Consumers, but do not provide the same fulsome experience as us. These competitors include, but are not limited to: 


• | Traditional on-demand “to the door” delivery services; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Similar through the door services of traditional retailers and independent service providers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include, but are not limited to: 


• | Near-zero Consumer acquisition cost;
--+-------------------------------------


• | Operational efficiency and speed of delivery;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Business Partnerships;
--+-----------------------


• | Technological innovation;
--+--------------------------


• | Ability to attract, train, and retain talent;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Service standards and capabilities;
--+------------------------------------


• | Consumer experience; and
--+-------------------------


• | Asset-light model.
--+-------------------

We believe that our unique commerce-at-home model, trust-oriented industry Business Partnerships and high service standards differentiate us from other service-oriented participants and provide us with an important competitive advantage. 
Seasonality 
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in sales due to the spending patterns of Consumers. Our revenue has generally been lowest in the first and second calendar quarters due to lower consumer demand following the fourth quarter holiday season and because of the decline in sales that typically occurs in anticipation of the introduction of new or enhanced smartphone and consumer technology, which usually take place in the third calendar quarter and which tend to drive sales in that quarter and the following quarter. Further, our revenue tends to be higher in the third and fourth calendar quarter due to seasonal sales such as “Black Friday” and “Cyber Monday,” as Consumers tend to make higher purchases during the holiday season. Our revenue for the second calendar quarter is generally the lowest of the year followed by the first calendar quarter. 
Human Capital Management 
Our mission is to deliver joy through life-improving mobile retail experiences each and every day. We believe that our continued success is dependent upon execution of this mission, and a critical component of delivering the best customer experiences is attracting, motivating and retaining great talent. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,723 full time employees, of which 2,255 are located in the North America segment and 468 are located in the Europe segment. We also employed 19 part time employees, of which 12 are located in the North America segment and 7 are located in the Europe segment. 
We are committed to delivering a deeply rewarding experience for our employees and are continually focused on talent development and management. We have implemented a robust annual goal-setting and performance management process to drive Enjoy’s mission, through which we strive to ensure that employee performance is connected to our company strategy and goals, and employees are aligned with our core values: Experience Obsessed, Growth Mindset, Justice, Kindness and Winning Together. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we focus on creating strong teams and a culture of innovation at every level of our organization through these core values. We also endeavor to offer a fair and competitive compensation and benefits program, provide a safe 

8 


workplace and foster a community where everyone feels empowered to do their best work and like they can be themselves. Our company culture is at the forefront of everything we do. We value open lines of communication, and solicit feedback from our workforce through ongoing, periodic surveys, as well as hold weekly virtual town hall meetings on a wide range of topics to ensure that employees are engaged. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and ethics, and promoting a culture of integrity and accountability. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”), which applies to each employee, officer, director, intern, contractor and agent who acts on our behalf, reinforces our core values and reflects the business practices and principles that support this commitment. Training on the Code of Conduct is mandatory upon employment. Highlights from our Code of Conduct include a non-retaliation policy for anyone who, acting in good faith, notifies us of a possible violation of the Code of Conduct, our policies or the law; a commitment to human rights; a conflicts of interest policy; a statement on environmental compliance; and a policy on international business laws, including laws prohibiting bribery, corruption or the conduct of business with specified individuals, companies or countries. 
Talent Development 
We are committed to investing in our employees’ growth and development. Enjoy endeavors to provide employees with access to the tools and support they need to be successful, including a comprehensive onboarding program and bespoke ongoing learning programs engineered for continued learning and development. Additionally, we provide a Leadership Development Program for new transitioning, and seasoned leaders in the field and at headquarters to build strong leadership skills and teams across the organization. 
Compensation and Benefits 
Our compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain employees to achieve Enjoy’s business objectives. Our programs are established based on market research and are designed to meet or exceed market benchmarks. Compensation programs include base salary, short-term incentives and equity awards that are designed to promote a performance-based culture. We also offer a comprehensive benefits program, including medical, dental and vision insurance; life insurance, flexible spending accounts, employee assistance program, paid time off, parental leave and a company-sponsored 401(k) plan. 
Advancing Justice 
We are an equal opportunity employer and committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination, bullying and harassment, and strive to maintain a culture that promotes equity, diversity and inclusion. We believe in the power of Enjoy employees’ combined voices to bring about change within Enjoy and in the communities we serve by working towards equity and holding ourselves accountable to just outcomes. We encourage our employees to identify injustices that affect the Enjoy community and collaboratively identify and implement solutions for lasting change. In addition, we create space for learning, listening, and inclusion through anonymous employee surveys and feedback, a dedicated Slack channel, as well as employee belonging groups. In 2021, we designated Juneteenth as an observed holiday and had our very first Day of Justice where we held listening and learning sessions with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion experts. 
Health and Safety 
Safety is very important to us, and we strive to provide our employees with a safe workplace and prioritize their physical and mental health and well-being. One of the ways in which we do this is by offering an Employee Assistance Program, which gives employees access to licensed professional counselors and other specialists at no cost for help with balancing work and life issues. Additionally, we offer our employees a confidential digital mental health wellbeing platform, Unmind, that can be accessed on any device at any time.

 We also offer a wellness library comprised of country-specific supporting links to support mental, physical and financial well-being. Finally, we have programs that encompass occupational safety, emergency preparedness, occupational injury and illness, physical work, driver safety, dangerous goods handling and sanitation. 
Approach to COVID-19
Given the in-person nature of our field operations, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted contactless procedures to ensure the safety of our Field Experts and Consumers. We previously implemented a robust testing, masking and temperature check program to prevent the spread of the virus, restricted travel, provided PPE and increased the sanitization of our facilities. We also instituted weekly meetings involving a cross-functional team, including key senior management, to ensure that COVID-19 related matters were addressed in a manner that was aligned with public health guidance and local regulations. As we continue to navigate through the evolving pandemic, we continue to evaluate ways to support the well-being of our employees in accordance with local laws and regulations and have dedicated internal teams that support our employees. 
Intellectual Property 
We rely on trademarks, domain names, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, contractual provisions and restrictions on access and use to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
As of December 31, 2021 we have 27 trademark registrations and applications in the United States and in several other jurisdictions outside the United States, including registrations for “Enjoy” and the Enjoy logo. 
We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic domain names, including “enjoy.com.” 
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with certain employees, consultants, contractors and Business Partners. Certain employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our website. 
Government Regulations 
We operate in a regulated industry and are currently subject to, and may in the future become subject to, a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as Internet and eCommerce, labor and employment, commissions and fees, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, Consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment”. 
Corporate History and Background 
Marquee Raine Acquisition Corp. (“MRAC” and, after the Domestication as described below, “New Enjoy”), our predecessor, a Cayman Islands exempted company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of 

10 


   April 28, 2021 and amended on July 23, 2021 and September 13, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among MRAC, MRAC Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of MRAC (“Merger Sub”), and Enjoy Technology Operating Corp.
