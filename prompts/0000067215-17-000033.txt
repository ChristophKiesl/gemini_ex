Item 1. Business. 
Dycom Industries, Inc. (“Dycom” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the United States and in Canada. Our subsidiary companies provide program management, engineering, construction, maintenance, and installation services for telecommunications providers, underground facility locating services for various utilities, including telecommunications providers, and other construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities. Our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2017 were $3.067 billion.
Dycom was incorporated in the State of Florida in 1969 and has since expanded its geographic scope and service offerings, both organically and through acquisitions. Our established footprint and decentralized workforce provide the scale needed to quickly execute on opportunities to service existing and new customers. 
Specialty Contracting Services 
Our subsidiaries supply telecommunication providers with a comprehensive portfolio of specialty services, including program management, engineering, construction, maintenance, installation, and underground facility locating. We provide the labor, tools and equipment necessary to design, engineer, locate, maintain, expand, install and upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure of our customers.
Engineering services include the design of aerial, underground, and buried fiber optic, copper, and coaxial cable systems that extend from the telephone company central office, or cable operator headend, to the consumer’s home or business. We also obtain rights of way and permits in support of our engineering activities and those of our customers as well as provide construction management and inspection personnel in conjunction with engineering services or on a stand-alone basis.
Construction, maintenance, and installation services include the placement and splicing of fiber, copper, and coaxial cables. In addition, we excavate trenches in which to place these cables; place related structures such as poles, anchors, conduits, manholes, cabinets, and closures; place drop lines from main distribution lines to the consumer’s home or business; and maintain and remove these facilities. We provide these services for both telephone companies and cable multiple system operators in connection with the deployment, expansion, or maintenance of new and existing networks. We also provide tower construction, lines and antenna installation, and foundation and equipment pad construction for wireless carriers, as well as equipment installation and material fabrication and site testing services. For cable television system operators, we install and maintain customer premise equipment such as digital video recorders, set top boxes and modems.
We also perform construction and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities and other customers. In addition, we provide underground facility locating services for a variety of utility companies, including telecommunication providers. Our underground facility locating services include locating telephone, cable television, power, water, sewer, and gas lines.
Business Strategy 
Capitalize on Long-Term Growth Drivers. We are well-positioned to benefit from the increased demand for network bandwidth that is necessary to ensure reliable video, voice, and data services. Significant developments in consumer and business applications within the telecommunications industry, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase the demand for greater capacity and enhanced reliability from our customers’ wireline and wireless networks. Telecommunications network operators are increasingly deploying fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to consumer demand, competitive realities, and public policy support. Additionally, wireless carriers are upgrading their networks and contemplating next generation mobile solutions in response to the significant demand for wireless broadband, driven by the proliferation of smart phones, mobile data devices and other advances in technology. The increasing wireless data traffic and newly emerging wireless technologies are beginning to drive significant incremental wireline deployments in many regions of the country. Furthermore, significant consolidation and merger activity among telecommunications providers can also provide increased demand for our services as networks are integrated.
Selectively Increase Market Share. We believe our reputation for high quality and our ability to provide services nationally creates opportunities to expand our market share. Our decentralized operating structure and numerous points of contact within customer organizations position us favorably to win new opportunities with existing customers. Our significant financial resources enable us to address larger opportunities that some of our relatively capital-constrained competitors may be unable to perform. We do not intend to increase market share by pursuing unprofitable work.

Pursue Disciplined Financial and Operating Strategies. We manage the financial aspects of our business by centralizing certain activities that allow us to reduce costs through leveraging our scope and scale. We have centralized functions such as treasury, tax and risk management, the approval of capital equipment procurements, and the design and administration of employee benefit plans. We also centralize our information technology infrastructure to provide enhanced operating efficiency. In contrast, we decentralize the recording of transactions and the financial reporting necessary for timely operational decisions. Decentralization promotes greater accountability for business outcomes from our local decision makers. Our local managers are responsible for marketing, field operations, and ongoing customer service, and are empowered to capture new business and execute contracts on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our executive management team provides support to the local marketing efforts, while also marketing at a national level. This approach enables us to utilize capital resources efficiently while retaining the organizational agility necessary to compete with smaller, privately owned competitors. 
Pursue Selective Acquisitions. We pursue acquisitions that are operationally and financially beneficial for the Company as a whole. In particular, we pursue acquisitions that will provide us with incremental revenue and geographic diversification while complementing our existing operations. We generally target companies for acquisition that have defensible leadership positions in their market niches, profitability that meets or exceeds industry averages, proven operating histories, sound management and certain clearly identifiable cost synergies.
Acquisitions
Fiscal 2017. During March 2017, we acquired Texstar Enterprises, Inc. (“Texstar”) for $26.1 million, net of cash acquired. Texstar provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers in the Southwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States. This acquisition expands our geographic presence within our existing customer base.
Fiscal 2016. During August 2015, we acquired TelCom Construction, Inc. and an affiliate (together, “TelCom”). The purchase price was $48.8 million paid in cash. TelCom, based in Clearwater, Minnesota, provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers throughout the United States. This acquisition expands our geographic presence within our existing customer base. During May 2016, we acquired NextGen Telecom Services Group, Inc. (“NextGen”) for $5.6 million, net of cash acquired. NextGen provides construction and maintenance services for telecommunications providers in the Northeastern United States. Additionally, during July 2016, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the wireless network deployment and wireline operations of Goodman Networks Incorporated (“Goodman”) for a net cash purchase price of $100.9 million after an adjustment of approximately $6.6 million for working capital received below a target amount. The acquired operations provide wireless construction services in a number of markets, including Texas, Georgia, and Southern California. The acquired operations were immediately integrated with the operations of an existing subsidiary, which is a larger, well-established provider of services to the same primary customer. The acquisition reinforces our wireless construction resources and expands our geographic presence within our existing customer base. Subsequent to the close of this acquisition, activity levels within the contracts of the acquired operations trended considerably below expectations. The acquired contracts remain in effect and we have not experienced any adverse changes in customer relations. With the immediate integration of the Goodman operations into our existing subsidiary, we believe our ability to effectively perform services for the customer will provide future opportunities.

Fiscal 2015. During September 2014, we acquired Hewitt Power & Communications, Inc. (“Hewitt”) for $8.0 million, net of cash acquired. Hewitt provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Southeastern United States. During January 2015, we acquired the assets of two cable installation contractors for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. During April 2015, we acquired Moll’s Utility Services, LLC (“Moll’s”) for $6.5 million, net of cash acquired. Moll’s provides specialty contracting services primarily for utilities in the Midwest United States. We also acquired the assets of Venture Communications Group, LLC (“Venture”) for $15.6 million during June 2015. Venture provides specialty contracting services primarily for telecommunications providers in the Midwest and Southeastern United States.
Customer Relationships
We have established relationships with many leading telecommunications providers, including telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, wireless carriers, telecommunication equipment and infrastructure providers, and electric and gas utilities. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers during each of fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 accounting for approximately 76.1%, 69.7%, and 61.1% of our total contract revenues, respectively. During fiscal 2017, we derived approximately 26.3% of our total revenues from AT&T Inc., 17.7% from Comcast Corporation, 17.5% from CenturyLink, Inc., 9.2% from Verizon Communications, Inc. and 5.4% from Windstream Corporation. We believe that a substantial portion of our total revenues and operating income will continue to be generated from a concentrated group of customers.

We serve our markets locally through dedicated and experienced personnel. Our sales and marketing efforts are the responsibility of the management teams of our subsidiaries who possess intimate knowledge of their particular markets, allowing us to be responsive to customer needs. Our executive management team supplements these efforts, both at the local and national levels, focusing on contact with the appropriate managers within our customers’ organizations.
We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other arrangements that contain customer-specified service requirements, having discrete pricing for individual tasks. We generally possess multiple agreements with each of our significant customers. To the extent that such agreements specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the customer’s ability to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, the performance of work with the customer’s own employees, and the use of other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility. In most cases, a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice. Historically, multi-year master service agreements have been awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process; however, we are occasionally able to extend these agreements through negotiations. We provide the remainder of our services pursuant to contracts for specific projects. These contracts may be long-term (with terms greater than one year) or short-term (with terms generally three to four months in duration) and often include customary retainage provisions under which the customer may withhold 5% to 10% of the invoiced amounts pending project completion.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal 2017 year ended on the last Saturday in July. In September 2017, our Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from July to January. Beginning with a six month transitional period ending January 27, 2018, our fiscal year will end on the last Saturday of January. We will file a transition report on Form 10-K containing audited financial statements for the six month period from July 30, 2017 to January 27, 2018. After the transition period, each fiscal year will consist of either 52 or 53 weeks of operations (with the additional week of operations occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter). Our 2019 fiscal year will commence on January 28, 2018.
The change in fiscal year end better aligns our fiscal year with the planning cycles of our customers. Year-over-year quarterly financial data will continue to be comparative to prior periods as the months that comprise each fiscal quarter in the new fiscal year are the same as those in our historical financial statements.
Fiscal 2017 and 2015 each consisted of 52 weeks of operations and fiscal 2016 consisted of 53 weeks of operations. The next 53 week fiscal period will occur in the fiscal year ending January 30, 2021. Unless otherwise noted, a reference to fiscal year in this report refers to the fiscal year ended on the last Saturday in July.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
The cyclical nature of the industry we serve may affect demand for our services. The capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers, and the related timing of approvals and seasonal spending patterns, influence our revenues and results of operations. The business requirements of our customers, driven by the demands of their consumers, the introduction of new communication technologies, the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure, the actions of our government and the Federal Communications Commission, and overall economic conditions, may affect their capital expenditures and maintenance budgets. Changes in our mix of customers, contracts, and business activities, as well as changes in the general level of construction activity also drive variations in revenues and results of operations.
Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather, which are more likely to occur during the winter season, impact our operations during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April.

Backlog

Our backlog consists of the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contractual agreements with our customers and totaled $6.016 billion and $6.031 billion at July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, respectively. We expect to complete 46.4% of the July 29, 2017 total backlog during the next twelve months. Our backlog estimates represent amounts under master service agreements and other contractual agreements for services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts and are based on contract terms, our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in similar procurements. The significant majority of our backlog estimates comprise services under master service agreements and other long-term contracts.
Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change because of project accelerations, contract cancellations, or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, commercial issues such as permitting, engineering changes, incremental documentation requirements, difficult job site conditions, and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue to be realized in different periods or in different amounts from those originally reflected in backlog. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. While we did not experience any material cancellations during fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015, many of our customers may cancel our contracts upon notice regardless of whether or not we are in default. The amount of backlog related to uncompleted projects in which a provision for estimated losses was recorded is not material.
Backlog is not a measure defined by United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others.
Competition 
The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly fragmented and includes a large number of participants. We compete with several large corporations and numerous small, privately owned companies. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our existing and prospective customers, particularly telecommunications providers that employ personnel who perform some of the same services we provide. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. As a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and the necessary equipment and materials may become a competitor. The principal competitive factors for our services include geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, worker and general public safety, price, quality of service, and industry reputation. We believe that we compare favorably to our competitors when evaluated against these factors.
Employees
We employed approximately 14,225 persons as of July 29, 2017. Our workforce includes a core group of technical and managerial personnel to supervise our projects and fluctuates in size to meet the demands of our customers. We consider our relations with employees to be good and believe our future success will depend, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, hire, and retain skilled and experienced personnel.
Materials and Subcontractors 
For a majority of the contract services we perform, our customers provide all materials required, while we provide the necessary personnel, tools, and equipment. Because our customers retain the financial and performance risk associated with materials they provide, we do not include associated amounts in our revenues or costs of earned revenues. Under contracts that require us to supply part or all of the required materials, we do not depend upon any one source for materials and do not anticipate experiencing procurement difficulties.
We contract with independent subcontractors to help manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amount that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. These independent subcontractors are typically small, locally owned companies that provide their own employees, vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. There are no individual independent subcontractors that are significant to the Company.

Safety and Risk Management
We are committed to instilling safe work habits through proper training and supervision of our employees and expect adherence to safety practices that ensure a safe work environment. Our safety program requires employees to participate in safety training required by law as well as that which is specifically relevant to the work they perform. The safety directors of our businesses review safety incidents and claims for our operations, examine trends, and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues.
Claims arising in our business generally include workers’ compensation claims, various general liability and damage claims, and claims related to motor vehicle collisions, including personal injury and property damage. For claims within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments. We accrue the estimated costs of claims as liabilities, and include estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Due to fluctuations in our loss experience from year to year, insurance accruals have varied and can affect the consistency of our operating margins. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we experience insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental Matters 
A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage resulting from underground objects we encounter. Liabilities for contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, or failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs including clean-up costs, fines, criminal sanctions for violations, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. These costs, as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
