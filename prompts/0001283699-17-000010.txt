History
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”) was formed in 1994 as VoiceStream Wireless PCS (“VoiceStream”), a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation (“Western Wireless”). VoiceStream was spun off from Western Wireless in 1999, acquired by Deutsche Telekom AG (“Deutsche Telekom”) in 2001 and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in 2002.
In 2013, T-Mobile US, Inc. was formed through the business combination between T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (“MetroPCS”). The business combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with T-Mobile USA as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, T-Mobile USA’s historical financial statements became the historical financial statements of the combined company.
Our common stock and our 5.50% mandatory convertible preferred stock, Series A (“preferred stock”) trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbols “TMUS” and “TMUSP,” respectively.
Business Strategy
We generate revenue by offering affordable wireless communication services to our postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and MetroPCS, through our owned and operated retail stores, third party distributors and our websites (www.T-Mobile.com and www.MetroPCS.com). The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K.
We continue to aggressively pursue our strategy, which includes the following elements:
Un-carrier Strategy
We introduced our Un-carrier strategy in 2013 and continue to aggressively focus on addressing customer pain points with the launch of additional signature moves. Un-carrier initiatives have included, but are not limited to, offering the following to qualifying customers:

• | beginning in 2017, with our introduction of Un-carrier Next, T-Mobile ONE includes:


• | monthly wireless service fees and taxes in the advertised monthly recurring charge;


• | paying participating customers back for data that is not used in a month if they use less than 2GB high-speed data/month; and


• | giving customers the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4G LTE plan and allowing our customers to keep their T-Mobile ONE price until they decide to change it.

Customer Experience
The ongoing success of our Un-carrier strategy and continued transformation of the network has strengthened T-Mobile’s position as a provider of dependable high-speed 4G LTE service. Additionally, we have continued to focus on retaining customers by delivering an improved wireless customer experience.  Branded postpaid phone churn improved to 1.30% in 2016, compared to 1.39% in 2015 and 1.58% in 2014. On September 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing T-Mobile co-branded customers to a current Mobile Virtual Network Operators (“MVNO”) partner for nominal consideration. The impact of this transaction resulted in improvements to branded postpaid phone churn for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Performance Measures of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of this Form 10-K for information regarding this transaction. Our branded postpaid net customer additions remained strong with 4.1 million in 2016, compared to 4.5 million in 2015 and 4.9 million in 2014, primarily driven by strong customer response to our Un-carrier initiatives, ongoing improvements to network quality, and promotions for services and devices. In addition, we continue to buildout our Extended Range LTE, which operates on our low-band 700 MHz A-Block spectrum. These results reinforce our position as an organization with a strong focus and commitment to providing an outstanding customer experience.
Aligned Cost Structure
We continue to pursue a low-cost business operating model to drive cost savings, which can then be reinvested in the business. These cost-reduction programs are on-going as we continue to simplify our business and drive operational efficiencies and cost savings in areas, such as network optimization, customer roaming and customer service. A portion of these savings have been, and will continue to be, reinvested into growth of our business.
Customers
We provide wireless communication services to three primary categories of customers: 

• | Branded postpaid customers generally include customers that are qualified to pay after using wireless communication services;


• | Branded prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communication services in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and MetroPCS; and 


• | Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and MVNO that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.

We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communication services to branded postpaid and branded prepaid customers. Our ability to acquire and retain branded postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2016, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communication services by customer category were:

• | 65% branded postpaid customers;


• | 31% branded prepaid customers; and


• | 4% wholesale customers, roaming and other services.

Services and Products
We provide wireless communication services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers. Services, devices and accessories are offered directly to consumers through our owned and operated retail stores, as 
5

well as through our websites. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites.
Our service plan offerings, which allow customers to subscribe for wireless services separately from the purchase of a device include: 

• | Our T-Mobile ONE plan (T-Mobile ONE), which was launched in September 2016 as phase 12.0 of our Un-carrier initiatives. T-Mobile ONE gives our customers unlimited calls, unlimited text and unlimited high-speed 4G LTE data on their device. On T-Mobile ONE, video typically streams at DVD (480p) quality and tethering is at maximum 3G speeds. Customers can choose to add on additional features to T-Mobile ONE for an additional cost. On T-Mobile ONE Plus customers also receive unlimited High Definition Video Day Passes, Voicemail to Text, NameID, unlimited Gogo in-flight internet passes on capable domestic flights and up to two times faster speeds when traveling abroad in 140+ countries and destinations. On T-Mobile ONE Plus International, customers receive the benefits of T-Mobile ONE Plus as well as free and reduced calling from the U.S. to foreign countries and unlimited high-speed 4G LTE mobile hotspot data in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. 


• | In January 2017, we introduced the latest in our Un-carrier initiatives, Un-carrier Next, where monthly wireless service fees and taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for T-Mobile ONE. We also unveiled Kickback on T-Mobile ONE, where participating customers who use 2 GB or less of data in a month, will get an up to a $10 credit on their next month’s bill per qualifying line. In addition, we introduced the Un-contract for T-Mobile ONE with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4G LTE plan, which allows T-Mobile ONE customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.


• | Simple Choice plans, which were launched in 2013 as part of phase 1.0 of our Un-carrier initiatives, eliminated annual service contracts and simplified the lineup of consumer rate plans to one affordable plan for unlimited voice and messaging services with the option to add data services. On January 25, 2017, we streamlined our Simple Choice plan offerings to new customers into our T-Mobile ONE plan. 

Depending on their credit profile, customers are qualified either for postpaid or prepaid service. 
Our device options for customers on T-Mobile ONE, and previously on Simple Choice plans, include:

• | Depending on their credit profile, qualifying customers who purchase a device from us have the option of financing all or a portion of the purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period of up to 24 months using our Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”).


• | In addition, qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP can enroll in our JUMP!® program (“JUMP!”) to later upgrade their device. Upon a qualifying JUMP! upgrade, the customer’s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their used device at the time of upgrade in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP. 


• | In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand. With JUMP! On Demand, a low monthly payment covers the cost of leasing a new device and gives qualified customers the freedom to exchange it for a new device up to three times in 12 months for no extra fee. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return their device in good working condition or purchase their device. 

Network Transformation Update
We continue to increase the depth, breadth and functionality of the nation’s densest LTE network by adding new spectrum to increase coverage, and re-farming existing spectrum and implementing new technology to augment capacity. Collectively, these network advancements help provide improved network performance and reliability for our customers.
Spectrum Growth
We provide mobile communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum. 

• | We owned or had agreements to own an average of 86 MHz of spectrum across the top 25 markets in the U.S. as of December 31, 2016, comprised of an average of 12 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 30 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 44 MHz in the AWS band. This is compared to an average of 85 MHz of spectrum across the top 25 markets in the U.S. as of December 31, 2015.

• | Over the last year, we have entered into and closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. See Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 


• | In addition, we intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future Federal Communications Commissions (“FCC”) spectrum license auctions, including the broadcast incentive auction of low-band 600 MHz spectrum licenses that is currently in-progress.


• | We have continued to build out our network to concentrate our cell sites where our customers need data most. We had approximately 66,000 cell sites, including macro sites and distributed antenna system network nodes as of December 31, 2016, compared to approximately 64,000 cell sites as of December 31, 2015. 


• | In 2015, we completed the shutdown of the MetroPCS Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”) network. The migration of customers from the MetroPCS CDMA network onto T-Mobile’s LTE and Evolved High Speed Packet Access Plus network provides faster network performance for MetroPCS customers with compatible handsets. 

Network Coverage Growth

• | We continue to expand our coverage breadth and currently provide 4G LTE coverage to 314 million people, up from zero 4G LTE coverage four years ago. We are targeting to provide 320 million people with 4G LTE coverage by year-end 2017. 


• | We own 700 MHz A-Block spectrum covering 272 million people or approximately 84% of the U.S. population. The spectrum covers all of the top 10 market areas and 29 of the top 30 market areas in the U.S. 


• | We have deployed our 700 MHz A-Block spectrum in over 500 market areas covering more than 252 million people under the name “Extended Range LTE.” We expect to continue to aggressively roll-out new 700 MHz market areas in 2017 including Chicago, Eastern Montana, and substantially all of the remaining population in 700 MHz licensed areas. 

Network Capacity Growth
We continue to expand our capacity through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE ("VoLTE"), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 MIMO, and 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation ("QAM").

• | At the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, approximately 70% of spectrum was being used for 4G LTE compared to 52% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect to continue to re-farm spectrum currently committed to 2G and 3G technologies. 


• | Re-farmed spectrum enables us to continue expanding Wideband LTE, which currently covers 232 million people. Wideband LTE refers to markets that have bandwidth of at least 15+15 MHz dedicated to 4G LTE. 


• | VoLTE currently comprises approximately 67% of total voice calls compared to 39% in December 2015. Moving voice traffic to VoLTE frees up spectrum and allows for the transition of spectrum currently used for 2G and 3G to 4G LTE. We are leading the U.S. wireless industry in terms of VoLTE migration. 


• | Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in 674 cities. This advanced technology delivers superior speed and performance by bonding two or three discrete spectrum channels together. 


• | 4x4 MIMO is currently available in more than 300 cities. This technology effectively delivers twice the speed, and incremental network capacity, to customers by doubling the number of data paths between the cell site and a customer's device. 


• | We have rolled out 256 QAM, which increases the number of bits delivered per transmission to enable faster speed.


• | Innovative programs like Binge On and T-Mobile ONE also create capacity by optimizing video for mobile viewing. These programs deliver material capacity benefits to both customers and our network. Since the launch of Binge On, our customers have watched more than 4 billion hours of optimized video. 

Network Speed Leadership
We continue to have the fastest nationwide 4G LTE network in the U.S. based on both download and upload speeds from millions of user-generated tests. This is the twelfth consecutive quarter that we have led the industry in both download and upload speeds.

Distribution
We had approximately 52,000 total points of distribution, including approximately 13,000 T-Mobile and MetroPCS branded locations and 39,000 third-party and national retailer locations, as well as distribution through our websites, as of December 31, 2016. Our distribution density in major metropolitan areas provides customers with the convenience of having retail and service locations close to where they live and work.
Competition
The wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and Sprint Corporation. AT&T and Verizon are significantly larger than us and may enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, existing MVNOs, such as TracFone Wireless, Inc., and future MVNOs, such as Comcast Corporation and Charter Communications, Inc., many of which offer or plan to offer no-contract, prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice and messaging, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless telecommunications industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation.  Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 50,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.
Regulation
The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. 
Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of cellular, PCS and point-to-point microwave licenses. AWS licenses have an initial term of 15 years, with successive 10-year terms thereafter. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. 
8

Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our company by Deutsche Telekom. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on Deutsche Telekom’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.
While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communication providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.
