Item 1. Business
 “Company”, "we", "our", "us", or "Luby's" refer to Luby’s, Inc., Luby's Fuddruckers Restaurants, LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company ("LFR") and the consolidated subsidiaries of Luby’s, Inc. References to “Luby’s Cafeteria” refer specifically to the Luby’s Cafeteria brand restaurants.
Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution
At a special meeting of stockholders held on November 17, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the Company’s Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation” or the “Plan”) that provides for the sale of the Company’s assets and distribution of the net proceeds to the Company’s stockholders, after which the Company will be dissolved. 
The Plan of Liquidation outlines an orderly sale of the Company's businesses, operations, and real estate, and an orderly wind down of any remaining operations. The Company intends to attempt to convert all of its assets into cash, satisfy or resolve its remaining liabilities and obligations, including contingent liabilities and claims and costs associated with the liquidation of the Company, and then file a certificate of dissolution. The assets to be sold include operating divisions Luby’s Cafeterias, Fuddruckers, and the Company’s Culinary Services business, as well as the Company’s real estate. The Company has completed the sales of the Luby’s Cafeterias and Fuddruckers operating divisions and several of its real estate assets. The Company currently anticipates that its common stock will be delisted from the NYSE upon the filing of the certificate of dissolution, which is not expected to occur until the earlier of the completion of the asset sales, the Company’s disposition of its remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating entity or November 17, 2023 (three years from the date of the approval of the Plan of Liquidation), but the delisting of its common stock may occur sooner in accordance with applicable rules of the NYSE. 
The Company cannot predict the timing or amount of any distributions to stockholders, as uncertainties exist as to the value it may receive upon the sale of assets pursuant to its monetization strategy, the net value of any remaining assets after such sales are completed, the ultimate amount of expenses associated with implementing its monetization strategy, liabilities, operating costs and amounts to be set aside for claims, obligations and provisions during the liquidation and winding-up process and the related timing to complete such transactions and overall process.
The Company does not intend to comment on or disclose developments regarding the process unless it deems further disclosure appropriate or required. Please see "Risk factors" in Item 1A.
