ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History
 JPX Global, Inc., (f.k.a. Jasper Explorations, Inc.) (the “Company”), was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 18, 2008 as Jubilee Resources, Inc., to explore mineral properties in North America. The name of the Company was subsequently changed to Jasper Explorations, Inc. on December 16, 2010. The name of the Company was again changed on January 3, 2013 from Jasper Explorations, Inc. to JPX Global, Inc.
 
On February 15, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of Scorpex, Inc. in exchange for 103,250,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company. A material condition of the agreement, production of audited financial statements, was not provided by Scorpex and therefore the acquisition agreement was terminated on May 16, 2013. We then resumed operations that existed prior to February 15, 2013, primarily, the exploration for copper, molybdenum and other minerals.
 
On February 5, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of Scorpex, Inc., a Nevada corporation, in exchange for 105,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Acquisition”). We are now expanding our business to further develop our operations as a development stage waste disposal and recycling company, with the goal of storing and disposing all types of waste, including those classified as industrial, toxic, and hazardous. With the acquisition of the Scorpex assets, the Company has a business model to capitalize on the opportunities available in the integrated waste, and waste management services sector primarily in Mexico. Through its exclusive license with Tratamientos Ambientales Scorpion S.A. de C.V., ("TAS") a Mexican corporation, we will participate in TAS’s developing approximately 26 acres it owns located at Fraccion A-2 Del Rancho El Encinito Km 18.7 Carretera A Ensenada-OJOS Delegacion Real Del Castillo, Ensenada, B.C. CP 22800 for the purpose of storing and disposing of residential and commercial, toxic, non-toxic, hazardous and non-hazardous waste. In addition to the Ensenada property detailed above, TAS has finalized a lease for a second property of approximately 5 hectacres located at Parcela 45 Y 46 Plan Libertador Blvd. 2000, Rosarito, B.C. This Rosarito lease is a 6-month term lease with a lessee option to renew every 6 months indefinitely. The cost for the lease is $2500 per month. TAS is a Mexican holding company that owns property, permits, and limited structures and has licensed its assets exclusively to JPX Global, Inc. in return for twenty percent (20%) of net revenues from operations in Mexico.
 
Waste Disposal Plan of Operations
 
We are a development stage company with no history of operations. As a result of the Acquisition of the Scorpex assets, the Company intends to further capitalize on opportunities in its integrated waste, and waste management service operations, including the receiving, storage, transfer and disposal in an environmental manner. In providing these services, we intend to actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive difference for our environment which will be focused on gasification of waste in an environmental manner. It is expected that our customer base will include commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste management companies, electric utilities, and governmental entity properties. We are a development stage company and have not realized any revenues. We do not have sufficient capital to enable us to commence and complete our exploration program. We will require additional financing in order to conduct the exploration programs described herein. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, raising substantial doubt about the Company’s financial prospects and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Waste management and collection involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to our planned gasification facilities. We intend to sub-contract our collection services. Waste is defined as nonhazardous waste sent off-site for final disposal through gasification including household waste, commercial, business or institutional waste, construction and demolition debris, regulated medical waste, yard waste, sludge, scrap tires and hazardous waste.
 
The Waste Gasification/Thermal Oxidation Plant, where we intend to convert waste to ash, is a two-stage waste combustion process that converts combustible organic matter from its existing solid, sludge or liquid state into a gas under an oxygen depleted environment (also known as “oxidation”). The resulting gas product is then well mixed with ambient air before being burnt off in a secondary gas-processing unit. The technology reverts any man made or organic waste product back to its natural state, which is inert ash or breathable air. The technology is capable of handling community solid waste content and biosolids including medical waste, tires, plastics, wood waste, oily waste, furniture and other organic or man-made compounds found in municipal or industrial waste.
 
The intended plant is comprised of three basic components: a Primary Gasification Cell, a Secondary Gas Processor, and a computerized Process Logic Controller. Combustible waste material is placed into the primary gasification cell through the load access door. In some facilities this can be done via a loading conveyor. The proposed design is to have collection vehicles dump their waste load directly into the primary oxidation cell. None of these components have been built on the property.
 
The Primary Cell can be either a batch or continuous feed processor. Based on our research, batch processing provides the most efficient and cost effective strategy for the waste management solution. In the case of batch processing once the cell has received that days collected waste, the door is closed and the process is initiated. The cell does not have to be full for the system to be activated.
 
An operator is responsible for supervising the loading of waste material, and initiating the process startup. A computer keystroke (or optional manual button and lever control) which pre-heats the secondary gas-processing unit accomplishes this start-up. Once that unit reaches its pre-set temperature, the primary gasification cell heater is activated, and the process begins. Approximately 8 to 12 hours later, the organic wastes in the primary cell will have been converted to a gas, and the cycle will generally be complete. The system will move to its “cool down” mode. In another 4-6 hours, the system may be re-loaded, and another process started, with or without the removal of the preceding load’s ash material.
 
Residual materials (bottles, cans, ash and misc.) need only to be removed periodically. The composition of MSW consists mainly of organic and combustible waste. Glass and metals are easily extracted in our plant design as it includes equipment that will assist in the process and cut down on labor man-hours. Ash removal is either an automated or manual process. In automated unloading, the base of the primary gasification cell contains a ductile iron furnace floor conveyor that evacuates material remaining in the base of the unit through a side access door. This dry waste material empties into a storage bin, which can be removed to another location for recycling.
 
Aluminum, metal and glass can be completely recovered. Emissions may be captured and used as a nonfossil fuel source for various “on site” processes.
 
Our intention is to take the ash that is left over from our disposal process and create a brick out of the residue. The machines that will be used, through 60 thousand pounds of pressure, will create this brick that can then be donated back to any municipality for various uses.
 
We intend to provide our services under two types of agreements:

• | For commercial and industrial collection services, we intend to enter a multi-year service agreement. The fees under these agreements will be influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to our facility, labor costs, cost of gasification and general market factors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For most residential collection services, we will have a contract with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality, homeowners’ association or some other regional authority that will give us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are typically for periods of one to five years. We expect the fees for residential collection to be either paid by the municipality or authority from their tax revenues or service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service.

With its current assets, and without further financing, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a Going Concern. However, the Company plans to raise the capital necessary to fund our business through a private placement and/or a public offering of our common stock.
 
Because the company has incurred losses, income tax expenses are immaterial. No tax benefits have been booked related to operating loss carry-forwards, given the uncertainty of the Company being able to utilize such loss carry-forwards in future years. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses during the coming year.
 
Market
 
We believe that the $55 billion US waste management industry will play a substantial role in the coming economic recovery and the growth of worldwide trade as traditional waste conversion, as well as the more technical methods such as gasification, plasma arc gasification, hydrolysis, and pyrolysis become cheaper and more efficient. In a world where in 2011 alone, the world’s rapidly increasing urban population generated nearly 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste (“MSW”), it is no longer sufficient to discard trash. It is estimated that this number will rise to at least 2.9 billion tons by 2022. Today, more than 800 thermal waste-to-energy (“WTE”) plants operate in nearly 40 countries around the globe. Led by Asia-Pacific and Europe, this number is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, potentially treating 396 million tons of MSW annually by 2022 with an estimated output of 151 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity. Of the municipal solid waste generated, 33 percent was recycled in 2011, up from 32 percent in 2010.
Competition
 
The solid waste industry is very competitive. Competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies, private solid waste companies, large commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private waste-to-energy companies. We also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial solid waste collection and solid waste landfills.
 
Operating costs, disposal costs and collection fees vary widely throughout Mexico. The prices that we intend to charge will be determined locally, and typically vary by the volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections, distance to final disposal sites, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We will face intense competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of service. However, we believe that we can distinguish the Company from our competition by providing precise accounting, exceptional customer service,

comprehensive tax management, and competitive pricing. While we intend to offer some customers credit terms, in most cases the credit lines will be secured by corporate or personal guarantees, deposits, letters of credit or other bank instruments, and liens.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
We will be required to conduct all waste disposal activities in accordance with government regulations. Such operations are subject to various laws governing land use, the protection of the environment, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, safety and other matters. Unfavorable amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of resource exploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a materially adverse impact and cause increases in capital expenditures which could result in a cessation of operations.
Employees
 
We use the services of various contract personnel from time to time. Although national unemployment rates remain high relative to historical averages, there exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the waste management and waste conversion industry. Nevertheless, we expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business resulting from future acquisitions and joint ventures. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
