 Company Overview 
    Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Adamis” or the “company”) is a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products in various therapeutic areas, including allergy, opioid overdose, respiratory and inflammatory disease. Our products and product candidates in the allergy, respiratory, and opioid overdose markets include: SYMJEPI™ (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2017 for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, for patients weighing 66 pounds or more; SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg which was approved by the FDA in September 2018, for use in the treatment of anaphylaxis for patients weighing 33-65 pounds; a naloxone injection product candidate, ZIMHI, based on the approved Symject™ injection device and intended for the treatment of opioid overdose for which the company resubmitted its New Drug Application, or NDA, in May 2020, received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA in November 2020, submitted responses to the deficiencies identified in the CRL and met with the FDA concerning the responses, and intends to resubmit its NDA; Tempol, an investigational drug; and a Beclomethasone metered dose inhaler product candidate (APC-1000) intended for the treatment of asthma for which the company submitted an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, in January 2018 but has suspended the start-up phase of Phase 3 studies. In June 2020, we entered into a license agreement with a third party to license rights under patents, patent applications and related know-how relating to Tempol. The exclusive license includes the worldwide use under the licensed patent rights and related rights for the fields of COVID-19 infection, asthma, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and influenza infection, as well as the use of Tempol as a therapeutic for reducing radiation-induced dermatitis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. In January 2021, the company submitted an IND to the FDA for the investigational use of Tempol for the treatment of coronavirus (COVID-19) and in February 2021, we were notified by the FDA that the agency had completed the safety review of the IND and concluded that the company may proceed with the proposed clinical investigation and trial described in the IND. Our goal is to create low cost therapeutic alternatives to existing treatments. Consistent across all specialty pharmaceuticals product lines, we intend to submit NDAs under Section 505(b)(2), of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA, or Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the FDA, whenever possible, in order to potentially reduce the time to market and to save on costs, compared to those associated with Section 505(b)(1) NDAs for new drug products.
 
Our US Compounding Inc. subsidiary, or USC, which we acquired in April 2016 and which is registered as a human drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the FDCA and the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, provides prescription compounded medications, including compounded sterile preparations and nonsterile compounds, to patients, physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States. USC's product offerings broadly include, among others, corticosteroids, hormone replacement therapies, hospital outsourcing products, and injectables. USC's compounded formulations in many circumstances are offered as alternatives to drugs approved by the FDA. USC also provides certain veterinary pharmaceutical products for animals.
 
To achieve our goals and support our overall strategy, we may need to raise additional funding in the future and make significant investments in, among other things, product development and working capital.
 
The current status of our development programs is as follows:

Anaphylaxis; Epinephrine Injection Pre-Filled Single Dose Syringe

The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, or AAAAI, defines anaphylaxis as a serious life-threatening allergic reaction. The most common anaphylactic reactions are to foods, insect stings, medications and latex. According to information published by AAAAI reporting on findings from a 2009-2010 study, up to 8% of U.S. children under the age of 18 had a food allergy, and approximately 38% of those with a food allergy had a history of severe reactions. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical treatment, including an injection of epinephrine.
 
We estimate that sales of prescription epinephrine products in 2020 were more than $2.0 billion, based on assumptions and estimates utilizing industry data. We cannot provide any assurances concerning any possible future rates of annual growth or whether annual prescription sales will decline or grow. The market for prescription epinephrine products is competitive, and a number of factors have resulted in, and could continue to result in, downward pressure on the pricing of, and revenues from sales of, our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg prescription epinephrine products. Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg and 0.3mg products allow users to administer a pre-measured epinephrine dose quickly with a device that we believe, based on human factors studies, to be intuitive to use. If the person using an auto-injector is not familiar with the function of the device and if not administered properly, there is a risk that it could misfire or be misused.
 
On June 15, 2017, the FDA approved our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg product for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis. SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg is intended to deliver a dose of epinephrine, which is used for emergency, immediate administration in acute anaphylactic reactions to insect stings or bites, allergic reaction to certain foods, drugs and other allergens, as well as idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis for patients weighing 66 pounds or more. On September 27, 2018, the FDA approved our lower dose SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg product, for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis in patients weighing 33 to 66 pounds.
 In July 2018, we entered into a Distribution and Commercialization Agreement, or the Sandoz Agreement, with Sandoz Inc., or Sandoz, to commercialize both of our SYMJEPI products. Under the terms of the agreement, we appointed Sandoz as the exclusive distributor of SYMJEPI in the United States and related territories, in all fields including both the retail market and other markets, and granted Sandoz an exclusive license under our patent and other intellectual property rights and know-how to market, sell, and otherwise commercialize and distribute the product in the licensed territory, subject to the provisions of the agreement, in partial consideration of an upfront fee by Sandoz and potential performance-based milestone payments. The agreement provided that Sandoz will pay to us 50% of the net profit from net sales, as each such term is defined in the agreement, of the product in the Territory to third parties, determined on a quarterly basis. We were the supplier of the product to Sandoz, and Sandoz ordered and paid us a supply price for quantities of products ordered. We were responsible for all manufacturing and, prior to Sandoz paying us the supply price, the component and supply costs related to manufacturing and supplying the product to Sandoz. In January 2019, we announced that Sandoz had launched SYMJEPI (epinephrine) 0.3 mg Injection in the U.S. market, initially available in the institutional setting. On July 9, 2019, we announced the full launch (institutional and retail) by Sandoz of both dose forms of the SYMJEPI injection products.
 On May 11, 2020, we announced that we entered into an agreement, or the Termination Agreement, with Sandoz to terminate the Sandoz Agreement following an initial transition period that ended as a result of the execution of a transition services agreement. The Termination Agreement provided for the mutually agreed return to us of the marketing, promotion, and distribution rights, and certain marketing and promotional materials, relating to the SYMJEPI products, and the termination of the Sandoz Agreement, supported by a transition services agreement that we entered into with Sandoz and USWM, LLC concerning certain transition services, activities and arrangements relating to the SYMJEPI products. As part of the Termination Agreement, Sandoz agreed to support the products in the U.S. under the Sandoz Agreement through the end of the transition period to help reduce or minimize potential impacts to patients and customers. The Termination Agreement also provided for a future resolution of amounts that may be payable or owed with respect to the net sales and profit sharing provisions of the Sandoz Agreement, and for survival of certain provisions of the Sandoz Agreement.
 On May 11, 2020, we announced that we entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement, or the USWM Agreement, with USWM, LLC, or USWM or US WorldMeds, for the United States commercial rights for the SYMJEPI products, as well as for the company’s ZIMHI product candidate. Under the terms of the USWM Agreement, we appointed USWM as the exclusive distributor of SYMJEPI in the United States and related territories, or the Territory, effective upon the termination of the Sandoz Agreement, and of the ZIMHI product if approved by the FDA for marketing, and granted USWM an exclusive license under our patent and other intellectual property rights and know-how to market, sell, and otherwise commercialize and distribute the products in the Territory, in partial consideration of an initial payment of $1,000,000 by USWM and potential regulatory and commercial based milestone payments totaling up to $26 million, if all of the milestones are achieved. There can be no assurances that any of these milestones will be met or that any milestone payments will be paid to us. We retain rights to the intellectual property subject to the USWM Agreement and to commercialize both products outside of the Territory. In addition, we may continue to use the licensed intellectual property (excluding certain of the licensed trademarks) to develop and commercialize other products (with certain exceptions), including products that utilize our Symject™ syringe product platform.

The USWM Agreement provides that, after deducting the supply price and subject to certain other deductions and adjustments, including an allocation for USWM sales and distribution expenses from net sales of the products, USWM will pay to us 50% of the net profit from net sales, as each such term is defined in the USWM Agreement, of the product in the Territory to third parties, determined on a quarterly basis. We will be the supplier of the products to USWM, and USWM will order and pay us a supply price for quantities of products ordered. The agreement does not include minimum payments to us by USWM, minimum requirements for sales of product by USWM or, with certain exceptions, minimum purchase commitments by USWM. Commencing in July 2020, USWM began promoting the SYMJEPI products through its field sales force. 
 On January 22, 2021, we announced that the SYMJEPI products added to the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club program and were available to members of the program.  The Walgreens Prescription Savings Club offers customers, who pay an annual membership fee, savings off retail prices on a large variety of medications. 
 On October 1, 2019, we entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement with a company in Australia to register and commercialize the SYMJEPI products in the Australia and New Zealand markets, after all required regulatory registration and approvals have been obtained. We anticipate that it could take many months in order to obtain the required registration and approvals. 
  Opioid Overdose
     ZIMHI (naloxone) Injection, APC-6000
     Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to treat narcotic overdoses. Naloxone, which is generally considered the drug of choice for immediate administration for opioid overdose, blocks or reverses the effects of the opioid, including extreme drowsiness, slowed breathing, or loss of consciousness. Common opioids include morphine, heroin, tramadol, oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl.
    The number of deaths due to opioids has increased over five-fold compared to 1999. According to statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the 12 months ending May 2020 drug overdoses resulted in approximately 81,000 deaths in the United States – greater than approximately 220 deaths per day. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50, and the proliferation of more powerful synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and its analogues, could result in future increases in the number of deaths resulting from opioid overdoses. Recent studies from 2013 to 2016 have revealed an approximately 87% increase in deaths associated with synthetic opioids, whereas, death rates due to natural and semisynthetic opioids remained relatively stable. With this significant increase in synthetic opioid abuse are published studies that have suggested that the current recommended doses of naloxone may be inadequate in that frequent redosing is required. Repeat dosing of the commonly utilized dose of naloxone suggests the need for a higher dosage product. 
 
In December 2018, we filed an NDA with the FDA relating to our higher dose naloxone injection product, ZIMHI, for the treatment of opioid overdose. On November 22, 2019, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for ZIMHI. The CRL stated that the FDA determined that it could not approve the NDA in its present form and provided recommendations needed for resubmission. A CRL is issued by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research when it has completed its review of a file and questions remain that preclude the approval of the NDA in its current form. The questions raised by the FDA related generally to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC. No other clinical safety or efficacy issues were raised. In December 2019, we provided responses to the FDA to the comments included in the CRL. In February 2020, we had a Type A meeting with the FDA to discuss our response to the CRL and the process and timeline for resubmission of the NDA to the FDA. At the meeting, we obtained concurrence from the agency on the CMC information required for resubmission of the NDA, including additional information involving extractables and leachables testing from the syringe and glassware. On May 15, 2020, we resubmitted to the FDA the NDA for ZIMHI. On November 13, 2020, we received a second CRL from the FDA regarding the resubmitted NDA.  The deficiencies and questions raised in the CRL related generally to new CMC issues.  We submitted responses to the deficiencies identified in the CRL and held a Type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the CRL and the company’s responses, and obtained input from the agency concerning the resubmission of the NDA. With the input from the meeting, the company intends to resubmit the NDA for ZIMHI to the FDA. The company expects to resubmit the NDA within approximately 45 days from the date of this Report absent unexpected delays, although there can be no assurance regarding the date that our NDA will be resubmitted. At the Type A meeting, the FDA did not provide any specific timeline for review of a resubmitted NDA. If the matters raised in the CRL cannot be resolved with the FDA division that sent the CRL, we may appeal the matter within the agency through a Formal Dispute Resolution process.  There can be no assurances regarding the timing or outcome of our resubmission of the NDA to the FDA or the FDA’s review of any resubmitted NDA relating to the ZIMHI product, the timing or outcome of any Formal Dispute Resolution process that we may decide to initiate, whether the FDA will regard our responses to the CRL and a resubmitted NDA as satisfactory, whether the FDA will require additional actions, information or trials after review of a resubmitted NDA or issue another CRL, or the timing, costs or outcome of any additional actions that may be required following any resubmission of the NDA, or that the product will be able to compete successfully in the market if approved and launched. The development of an intramuscular injection of naloxone for the treatment of opioid overdose will require commercial scale manufacturing subject to review and approval by the FDA.
  On May 11, 2020, we entered into the USWM Agreement with USWM for the United States commercial rights for the ZIMHI product candidate, as well as for the SYMJEPI products.

Tempol (APC400 and APC 410)
On June 12, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Matrix Biomed, Inc., or the Licensor, to license rights under patents, patent applications and related know-how of Licensor relating to Tempol, an investigational drug. The exclusive license includes the worldwide use under the licensed patent rights and related rights of Tempol for the fields of COVID-19 infection, asthma, respiratory syncytial virus infection, and influenza infection. In addition, the exclusive license includes the use of Tempol as a therapeutic for reducing radiation-induced dermatitis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. In consideration for the Licensor providing the rights under its patent rights and related know-how relating to Tempol within the licensed fields, we paid Licensor $250,000 and also issued to the Licensor 1,000,000 shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which has converted into an equal number of shares of our common stock.
 Tempol is a redox cycling nitroxide that promotes the metabolism of many reactive oxygen species and improves nitric oxide bioavailability. It has been studied extensively in animal models of oxidative stress and inflammation. Overall, Tempol acts as both a super-oxide dismutase mimetic and also has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant activity. Inflammation and oxidative stress occur in various disease states including COVID-19. Both inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from cells of the immune system called macrophages and neutrophils damage the lung in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Many published articles describing animal models of ARDS show Tempol caused a decrease in lung inflammation and preserved lung pathology associated with acute and chronic lung injury.  In animal models, Tempol has been shown to decrease proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), and through its antioxidant activity has been shown to decrease the harmful effects of ROS.  In addition, Tempol has been shown to decrease platelet aggregation, a problem observed in many COVID-19 patients. 
 In July 2020, we submitted to the FDA a pre-IND package which provided a protocol for a Phase 2/3 study examining Tempol in COVID-19 patients, and the FDA provided comments regarding the prospective use of Tempol in a randomized placebo controlled trial. In January 2021, we submitted an IND to the FDA for the investigational use of Tempol for the treatment of COVID-19. The submission of the IND to the FDA followed a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in which the agency gave specific recommendations on CMC and conduct of the clinical trial to be included in the IND. On February 22, 2021, we announced that the company was notified by the FDA that the agency had completed the safety review of the IND and concluded that the company may proceed with the proposed clinical investigation and trial described in the IND. The goal of the study titled, "A Phase 2/3, Adaptive, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Examine the Effects of Tempol (MBM-02) on Preventing COVID-19 Related Hospitalization in Subjects with COVID-19 Infection," is to examine the safety and activity of Tempol in COVID-19 patients early in the infection. In addition to safety, the study will examine markers of inflammation and the rate of hospitalization for patients taking Tempol versus placebo early in COVID-19 infection. We currently anticipate that the trial will begin in the second quarter of 2021. On January 28, 2021, we announced that in collaboration with the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University we conducted a study to investigate the effects of Tempol on immune cells from COVID-19 patients, and that preliminary data from that study showed that Tempol decreases cytokines from stimulated cells from COVID-19 patients. In March 2021, we announced that in studies conducted at Galveston National Laboratory, University of Texas Medical Branch, hamsters challenged with the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) showed decreased inflammation in the lungs when treated with Tempol compared to controls. We intend to continue to explore the availability of government and/or non-government funding to help support study the efficacy of Tempol as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19. We also continue to explore options regarding the funding and design of a clinical study to examine the effects of Tempol for the treatment of radiation induced dermatitis and are engaged in additional formulation and development and GMP manufacturing processes intended to support an IND to begin such a study.
  Asthma and Bronchospasm
     According to the National Institute of Health, or NIH, asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. According to information published by Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, or CDC, reporting on findings from 2018 the number of people in the U.S. with asthma is approximately 24.8 million and growing. We estimate that global sales of asthma and bronchospasm prescription products were in excess of approximately $6.9 billion in 2020, based on industry data.      Asthma; APC-1000 Metered Dose Inhaler
    Our APC-1000 product candidate is a steroid hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, metered dose inhaler product, intended for the treatment of asthma. Our product candidate, if developed and approved for marketing, would be intended to target a small niche within the larger market for respiratory products. In January 2018, we submitted an IND application to the FDA to begin late-stage clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of APC-1000 as a treatment for asthma. We received approval from the agency to proceed with the Phase 3 studies, and in December 2018, we initiated the start-up phase of the trial. However, we terminated the start-up phase and start of patient enrollment for the studies, and have suspended the study, in light of, among other factors, the availability of adequate funding to continue and complete the studies and changes in market conditions and competitive developments in the relevant markets.  There are no assurances that we will pursue this opportunity, for financial or other reasons, and as of the date of this Report, we do not intend to resume the studies or devote any substantial resources to pursue development of this product candidate.

Other Product Candidates or Technologies    
Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Device Platform.  In December 2013, we acquired assets relating to the 3M Company’s patented Taper dry powder inhaler (DPI) technology under development by 3M for the treatment of asthma and bronchospasm. The Taper DPI technology was designed to efficiently deliver dry powder by utilizing a 3M proprietary microstructured carrier tape. We utilized the Taper DPI assets in the development of a DPI device that, if successfully developed, could be utilized to deliver a variety of different drug compounds and be used as a platform delivery device to develop products that will compete in the respiratory markets. Our agreement with 3M contemplated that the microstructured carrier tape would be supplied by 3M under a separate commercial supply agreement to be negotiated with 3M. One advantage of the technology is that it can deliver drug particles without the need for lactose or formulation excipients. The majority of current dry powder products use lactose carrier excipients to enhance flowability; however, they have the disadvantage of increased bulk and require a mechanism for detaching the drug from the surface of the lactose. Lactose carrier formulations require a complicated blending process and delivery that is highly sensitive to excipient powder properties.
 
Our product candidate considered for development utilizing the DPI technology platform, APC-4000, was intended to deliver Fluticasone Propionate (fluticasone) as a dry powder formulation for the treatment of asthma. Fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids and is the same active ingredient as GlaxoSmithKline’s Flovent® Diskus® indicated for the treatment of asthma. We conducted proof of concept studies with the DPI for APC-4000 in 2018 and 2019 which demonstrated that the device functioned as designed. We believe that next steps in development could include the creation of a commercial-ready manufacturing line and, from devices manufactured on the new line, following submission and acceptance of an IND the conduct of one or more Phase 3 trials, although additional trials such as pharmacokinetic, or PK, and/or other studies might be required before or in connection with any Phase 3 trials. However, in light of the time and costs involved in further product development efforts and competitive conditions in the relevant markets, we are not devoting, and do not intend to devote, any substantial financial resources to development of this product candidate, and we have determined not to pursue further development efforts regarding this product candidate. 
 
 C31G. We also have a microbicide product candidate, named C31G. In December 2010, we announced the successful completion of a Phase 3 contraceptive trial of C31G. The study met its primary endpoint and was conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), NIH, in the Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network at 14 sites in the United States. The clinical investigators found that C31G was not inferior in contraceptive efficacy to the comparator drug Conceptrol. Moreover, the gel was well-tolerated and had a high degree of acceptability in women who completed the study. C31G does not contain nonoxynol-9 and, if commercialized, could offer an alternative for women who seek a non-hormonal method of contraception. In addition, in September 2013 we announced that a published study conducted by university researchers at Louisiana State University Health Science Center found that C31G was effective in treating Herpes Simplex Virus, or HSV, in an eye infection (ocular keratitis) animal model using live rabbits. In the same study the researchers also reported that ocular administration of C31G was safe and well tolerated, confirming earlier clinical studies that established C31G safety and tolerability in other applications. HSV-1 is the same virus that causes cold sores and is common in humans. In the eye, it usually causes an infection of the cornea, and that infection can cause cornea-derived blindness. In previous animal studies, C31G was also active against HSV-2, the cause of genital herpes. Before considering any actions to further develop or consider commercialization alternatives for a C31G product candidate, further meetings with the FDA would be required to discuss the regulatory pathways for submitting an NDA for marketing approval, including the additional trials that would be required before an NDA is submitted, and in addition, we would seek to enter into an out-licensing or similar transaction with third party entities or organizations. The C31G product candidate is held by our Biosyn, Inc. subsidiary, which we acquired in 2004. Provisions in the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Biosyn, and/or in certain of the funding or other agreements relating to the C31G product, provide for payments to the former Biosyn shareholders upon marketing approval by the FDA (or, in certain circumstances, certain foreign regulatory authorities) of C31G for one or more indications, and for payments to certain other third parties in the event of sales or other revenues relating to C31G or certain other events. In addition, sale or out-licensing of the C31G product candidate may require the consent of one or more such third parties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will pursue commercialization of or enter into any agreement or transaction involving C31G or concerning the amounts that we might receive from any such transaction, or that any C31G product will be developed, submitted for regulatory approval, approved or marketed.

Our development plans and decisions regarding our products and product candidates, including whether to continue, resume or terminate product development efforts, are affected by a number of factors, including without limitation the availability of adequate funding, the development, clinical trial and regulatory pathway for the product candidate, the costs and results of preparing for and conducting any additional studies, trials or development efforts that we may determine to undertake, the pace of conduct, progress, and completion of, studies relating to our product candidates, the absence of unexpected regulatory issues or delays, the time period required to enroll a sufficient number of patients in the study, our success in negotiating and entering into development or commercialization agreements relating to our products should we choose to seek commercialization partners for one or more of our products or product candidates, and the commercial and competitive landscape for the product including the introduction of potentially competing new products by our competitors. As a result, our product development plans, as well as the anticipated dates for development and introduction of products in our product pipeline, could be affected by such considerations. In considering development and commercialization alternatives for our products and product candidates and technologies, we may seek to enter into development or commercialization agreements, license agreements, or other strategic agreements with third parties relating to development, commercialization and marketing of one or more of our products or product candidates. We currently have no in-house manufacturing capabilities, and as a result we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture the materials needed for our clinical trials, products and product candidates. 
 
Additional factors that could affect the development and launch dates for our products and product candidates include general market conditions, the outcome of discussions with the FDA concerning the regulatory approval pathway of the applicable product candidate including the number and kind of clinical trials that the FDA will require before the FDA will consider regulatory approval of the applicable product, any unexpected difficulties in licensing or sublicensing intellectual property rights that may be required for other components of the product, patent infringement lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV certifications as part of any Section 505(b)(2) or ANDA filings, any unexpected difficulties in the ability of our suppliers to timely supply quantities for commercial launch of the product, any unexpected delays or difficulties in assembling and deploying an adequate sales force to market the product, and receipt of adequate funding to support product development and sales and marketing efforts.   
 
 Prescription Compounded Medications 
     Overview. Our USC subsidiary, which is registered as a drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the FDCA and the DQSA, provides prescription compounded medications, including compounded sterile preparations or CSPs, and non-sterile compounds to physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States. USC’s product offerings broadly include, among others, corticosteroids, hormone replacement therapies, hospital outsourcing products, and injectables. USC also provides compounded pharmaceutical products for animals.
      USC sources raw materials and commercial products only from suppliers registered with the FDA. Utilizing these raw material components, USC prepares and provides a broad range of customized stock keeping units to meet the individual requirements of customers.

USC’s business is focused on marketing a portfolio of compounded preparations, including sterile injectable and non-sterile integrative therapies.  Most of these formulations are offered in different formats than other available alternatives, such as in suspension or preservative free. Many hospitals and surgery centers look to outsourcing facilities to obtain medications in ready-to-use, or RTU, format, with the specific packaging, volume, and strength often unique to individual facilities. Many facilities and practitioners also look to outsourcing facilities when medications are on temporary backorder from the manufacturer or are discontinued. Veterinary products sold by USC include, without limitation, a formulation of an equine ulcer product that addresses what we believe is a significant market. Many horses that are competing and under stress have been shown to have gastric ulcers.  We have completed a study comparing a combination formulation of omeprazole and fenbendazole to placebo, and the study results indicated that the combination formulation was effective in reducing gastric ulcer sores and reducing squamous ulcer disease in horses.  We intend to continue development of this product candidate.

 Compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities combine different ingredients, some of which may be FDA-approved drugs or components of FDA-approved drugs, to create specialized preparations prescribed by a physician. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions, or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. A physician may also work together with a pharmacist to repurpose or reformulate FDA-approved drugs via the compounding process to meet a patient’s specific medical needs. These compounds are distributed to hospitals, surgery centers, and practitioners. Examples of compounded medications prepared by outsourcing facilities include sterile syringes used by hospital and surgery center operating rooms, sterile injectables administered by the practitioner in the office, and unit-dosed sterile and non-sterile medications. USC’s outsourcing facility receives its active pharmaceutical ingredients from three main suppliers, which accounted for the majority of USC’s drug and chemical purchases in 2020 and 2019.
 
The pharmacy sterile compounding industry arose in part because hospitals and other healthcare providers administering drugs require concentrations, dosage forms and delivery systems that are not readily commercially available from drug manufacturers in an RTU form. Historically, safety and quality standards for compounded medications were not well defined or implemented, leading to demand for safer compounding practices, and the level of state regulation varied significantly. The 2012 nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak caused by a compounding pharmacy led to increased regulatory oversight of the industry which, among other things, led to the passage of the DQSA and its creation of Section 503B outsourcing facilities as a new, more highly FDA-regulated category of interstate outsourced CSP providers. Registration as a Section 503B outsourcing facility is currently voluntary. USC was incorporated in Arkansas in 2004 and registered with the FDA as a Section 503B outsourcing facility in December 2013.
      In recent years, there have been increases in the cost of certain injectable drugs and related products as a result of (i) enhanced oversight by the FDA and other regulatory bodies of manufacturers of injectable products, and the added costs associated therewith, (ii) decreased competition when drug manufacturers voluntarily cease producing certain drugs or face temporary regulatory suspension or permanent regulatory shut down of their operations, and (iii) consolidation among drug manufacturers. These factors have led some manufacturers to raise prices of some products and have also contributed to market shortages of injectable products, containers and diluents. These shortages and the potential inability to secure an adequate supply of necessary drug formulations can have a significant impact on the day-to-day business and operations of USC and its customers.
    Since we acquired USC in April 2016, we have taken several measures intended to support the growth of the business including hiring additional personnel, expanding sales channels, and strengthening our production processes. USC has, and after our acquisition of USC we have, invested capital in efforts to comply with new and anticipated FDA regulations applicable to its business and outsourcing facilities, to expand product offerings, enhance production capabilities, improve warehouse space, develop new packaging, labeling and processing solutions, refine quality and safety measures, and develop technology for the intake and management of customer orders. Historically, research and development costs have consisted primarily of costs associated with the research and development of new CSPs, such as salaries and other personnel-related expenses for employees involved with research and development activities, pre-launch sterility and stability testing and other related expenses. Regulatory guidance provided by the FDA, and additional regulatory guidance is expected to increase the validation and development costs for current and new products. 
 
The COVID-19 outbreak adversely affected revenues in 2020 from sales of USC products, in part due to reductions or cancellations of elective surgeries and reduction in office visits to physicians’ offices, healthcare facilities or clinics by patients, and the resulting decreased demand by USC’s customers for certain of USC’s products, and will likely continue to adversely affect revenues from sales of USC products for a period of time which cannot be predicted. Moreover, COVID-19 has restricted USC from utilizing traditional sales and marketing efforts, such as regular sales visits to customers, in generating revenues. 
 
Letter of Intent
 On January 26, 2021, we announced that we have entered into a non-binding letter of intent with a potential buyer for sale of substantially all of the assets of our USC subsidiary.  Under the terms described in the letter of intent, the buyer would agree to acquire substantially all of the assets of US Compounding in exchange for a total gross consideration that could range from approximately $10-$20 million, before transaction fees and expenses and other potential post-closing adjustments.
 If a transaction is negotiated, reflected in definitive agreements entered into by the parties, and completed, the proposed purchase price consideration includes a combination of a cash payment at the closing of the transaction, a promissory note representing portion of the purchase price payable at a future date, and potential future performance-based milestone payments over a period of years.  The amount and structure of consideration could change as a result of subsequent negotiations, due diligence or other factors.

Any definitive agreement would be subject to approval by the respective parties, including approval by our board of directors, and would likely include a number of customary provisions, including without limitation representations and warranties of USC and us, restrictive covenants and indemnification provisions.
 If definitive agreements are negotiated and entered into, the closing of a transaction would be contingent on the satisfaction of closing conditions which might include, among other things: (i) the receipt of required governmental, regulatory, and third-party consents and approvals, (ii) buyer obtaining required licenses, permits, registrations, or other approvals from the necessary state boards of pharmacy and other state and federal governmental authorities, and (iii) other customary closing conditions.
 The letter of intent is non-binding other than with respect to certain customary confidentiality and exclusivity provisions.  There can be no assurances that the parties will negotiate and enter into definitive transaction agreements or concerning the final terms that might be included in any definitive agreements, whether a transaction will be completed, concerning the timing of closing of any such transaction or concerning the amount of consideration that we might receive at the closing or over time from any such transaction.     Clinical Supplies and Manufacturing 
     Except for our facilities at USC that are utilized to prepare compounded formulations, we have no in-house manufacturing or distribution capabilities and have no current plans to establish manufacturing facilities for significant clinical or commercial production. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and make the material used to support the development of our product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. In complying with cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to ensure that their services and products meet applicable specifications and other requirements. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to development of products without devoting the resources and capital required to build cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities. Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products are manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, Catalent Belgium SA/NV, utilizing materials to complete the manufacturing process obtained from various companies and suppliers, and assembly and final packaging of the product is implemented by a third-party entity, Phillips-Medisize, LLC. There are potential sources of supply other than our existing suppliers, although new suppliers would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements.
 Sales and Marketing 
    Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) products were initially marketed and sold in the U.S. markets by Sandoz pursuant to our commercialization agreement with Sandoz, and following the termination of that agreement in 2020 are marketed and sold in the U.S. markets by USWM pursuant to our commercialization agreement with USWM.  We sell compounded pharmacy formulations through USC’s sales and marketing employees and arrangements with third parties for sales and marketing support. Sales and marketing activities of USC consist primarily of efforts to educate doctors, ambulatory surgery centers, healthcare systems, hospitals, veterinarians, and other users throughout the U.S. about USC’s products and services. USC’s sales and marketing team is focused on customer retention as well as generating sales from new and existing customers. 
      Customers and Distribution 
    On January 16, 2019, we announced that Sandoz had launched SYMJEPI (epinephrine) 0.3 mg Injection in the U.S. market, initially available in the institutional setting. On July 9, 2019, we announced the full launch (institutional and retail) by Sandoz of both dose forms of the SYMJEPI injection products. On May 11, 2020, we announced that we terminated the distribution and commercialization agreement with Sandoz, supported by a transition services agreement that we entered into with Sandoz and USWM, LLC concerning certain transition services, activities and arrangements relating to the SYMJEPI products. Also, on May 11, 2020, we announced that we entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement with USWM for the United States commercial rights for the SYMJEPI products, as well as for the company’s ZIMHI product candidate. Pursuant to our agreement with USWM, we are responsible for supplying the SYMJEPI products to USWM at a supply price for quantities of products ordered. On January 22, 2021, we announced that the SYMJEPI products added to the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club program and were available to members of the program.  The Walgreens Prescription Savings Club offers customers, who pay an annual membership fee, savings off retail prices on a large variety of medications. A significant portion of revenues from USC sales of human compounded pharmacy formulations consist of sales to physician clinics and hospitals.

 Competition 
     The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and those of our collaborators obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in the fields in which we compete.     Our products and product candidates, if developed, approved and launched, will compete with numerous prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter products targeting similar conditions, as well as prescription generic products. In addition, a number of large pharmaceuticals companies produce similar pharmaceutical products for similar indications. Moreover, certain products that previously have been available by prescription only have been or could in the future be approved by the FDA for sale over-the-counter without a prescription at a lower price than competing prescription products, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market a competing prescription product.
 
The SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products compete against other self-administered epinephrine products, including EpiPen, EpiPen Jr., Auvi-Q and Adrenaclick. There has been market and regulatory focus in recent years on the prices to consumers of self-administered epinephrine products, which have exerted downward pressure on the pricing of such products. The company that markets EpiPen, introduced an authorized generic version of the auto-injector product at a lower price than the EpiPen. Additionally, in late 2018 a generic, or A/B rated, competitor to EpiPen was approved and launched. Other competing products have been introduced or prices on existing competing products have been reduced, and if additional competing products are introduced in the future, including additional generic versions of one or more existing spring-loaded auto-injector devices, at lower prices than the current market leading products, the competitive success of our SYMJEPI products could be adversely affected. The competitive success of our products could also be adversely affected by changes in the willingness of insurance companies and other third-party payors to cover or reimburse some or all of the costs to consumers of our products. Our high dose naloxone injection product candidate ZIMHI (APC-6000) for opioid overdose, if approved and introduced, is expected to compete with other products in the markets for opioid overdose. If we successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of one or more Tempol products, such products would compete with other products in the markets for the approved indications.
      Compounded Pharmacy Formulations. The compounded pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against other FDA-registered outsourcing facilities, branded drug companies, generic drug companies, regional compounders that provide patient-specific compounding that decide to expand to 503B outsourcing, non-patient-specific compounding, large hospitals and integrated delivery networks, other compounding pharmacies, and new entrants to the industry. Many competitors that market and sell compounded preparations have longer operating histories and may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. We are smaller than some of such competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of USC’s formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. These potential competitors could leverage existing resources and experience operating in industries that are subject to significant regulatory oversight in order to overcome certain barriers to entry. Consequently, competitors may be able to develop products and services competitive with, or superior to, USC’s products and services. Furthermore, we may not be able to differentiate USC’s compounded preparations and services from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new services—on a timely basis or at all—that are less costly than those of our competitors or offer customers payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. We expect competition to intensify as technology advances, such as those in the field of robotics and automation, and consolidation continues. Also, new developments by pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as increasing the number of abbreviated new drug applications, to cover less frequently used drug formulations, could render some or many of USC’s products or services obsolete. In addition, the drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which USC’s formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. USC’s compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA. As a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, USC’s formulations. Increased competition could reduce revenue and gross profit and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, guidance documents published by the FDA in 2018 require certain attestation of clinical need on behalf of the ordering physician or his or her delegate, and some entities may be unwilling or logistically unable to accommodate this new requirement. 
 
 Pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies and outsourcing facilities, could render USC’s products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete effectively. Other competitive factors include the safety and efficacy of a product, the size of the market for a product, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of a product relative to alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement, the success of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition and the availability of scientific and technical information about a product.

 Intellectual Property 

 Our success will depend in part on our ability to:
    
● | obtain and maintain international and domestic patents and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prosecute and defend our patents; 
● | preserve our trade secrets; and 
● | operate without infringing on the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. 

 We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs where applicable and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations. As of December 31, 2020, the company had: (i) 23 issued patents in the United States and 13 pending applications, two of which have been allowed; (ii) 96 issued and 43 pending foreign patent applications, four of which have been allowed, relating to our Symject™ injection device, DPI and C31G products and product candidates, among other things. The issued patents and allowed patents applications expire between 2020 and 2041, not taking into account any potential patent-term extensions that may be available in the future.
      Although we believe that our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. It is possible that any patents or patent rights that we obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors.
     We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.
     Government Regulation 
     Pharmaceutical Regulation 
     The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States is subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation.
     In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and generally require a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs. We also may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug product sales if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the United States varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
     Regulation in the United States
     The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. Our product candidates that require marketing approval by the FDA will be regulated as drugs. In the United States, drugs are subject to regulation under the FDCA. The statute and related regulations govern, among other things, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices. The FDA approval process for new drugs generally includes, without limitation:
    
● | preclinical studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for clinical trials; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product; 
● | review of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and 
● | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations.

 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to good laboratory practices, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. The results of the preclinical studies, existing clinical and/or human use data (if applicable), together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which we are required to file before we can commence any clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of any additional IND for any of our preclinical product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. Also, clinical trials must be performed according to good clinical practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents.
    Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2 and 3. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In Phase 1 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of subjects to determine safety, existence of adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. In Phase 2 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of subjects to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. In Phase 3 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a larger number of subjects to determine efficacy and to further determine safety, usually at multiple clinical sites. We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical trials will result in approval to market additional products.
      An NDA must include comprehensive and complete descriptions of the preclinical testing, clinical trials and the chemical, manufacturing and control requirements of a drug that enable the FDA to determine the drug’s or biologic’s safety and efficacy. An NDA must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies, and must be submitted, filed and approved by the FDA before any drug product that we may successfully develop and that requires marketing approval by the FDA can be marketed commercially in the United States.
      The facilities, procedures and operations for any of our contract manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP, licensing specifications and other FDA regulations before and after an NDA has been approved. Foreign manufacturing facilities are also subject to periodic FDA inspections or inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs or other product applications if deficiencies are found at the facility. Vendors that may supply us with finished products or components used to manufacture, package and label products are also subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.    
 In addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.
     Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.
     Once the FDA receives an NDA, it has 60 days to review the application to determine if it is substantially complete and the data is readable, before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submission to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity.

Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions, and would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness if approved.  For a Priority Review application, the FDA aims to complete the initial review cycle for New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, within six months of the 60 day filing date, and for non-NMEs within six months of the date of receipt. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Review NDAs for NMEs within ten months of the 60 day filing date, and for Non-NMEs within ten months of the date of receipt. Such dates are often referred to as the PDUFA dates. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either Standard Reviews or Priority Reviews of NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. In addition, the FDA’s review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, issuance of a complete response letter, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding any required risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, FDA workload issues or other reasons.
 
  The FDA also has established programs to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious conditions.  For example, the fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and address an unmet medical need. The FDA generally attempts to facilitate early and frequent meetings with sponsors of fast track drugs.  The breakthrough therapy designation is granted to drugs intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. In addition to early and frequent meetings between the sponsor and FDA, benefits of breakthrough designation include intensive guidance on efficient drug development from FDA, as well as organizational commitment from FDA.  Finally, accelerated approval may be granted for a drug that treats a serious condition and provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and the drug demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint or a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality.
 
As a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS.  A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks.  REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professional, and elements to assure safe use. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to the application’s approval. The amount of time taken for the approval process is a function of a number of variables, including whether the product has received priority review or has received another expedited program designation, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA. The FDA may, during its review of an NDA, ask for additional test data or the conducting of additional clinical trials.
 
 Prior to regulatory approval, the FDA may elect to obtain advice from outside experts regarding scientific issues and/or marketing applications under FDA review. These outside experts are convened through the FDA’s Advisory Committee process. An Advisory Committee will report to the FDA and make recommendations. Views of the Advisory Committee may differ from those of the FDA, and the FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an Advisory Committee. 
    Before approving an NDA, the FDA generally will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the processes and procedures used are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the preclinical toxicology research sites to assure that the preclinical studies were conducted in compliance with GLP requirements. If the FDA determines that the studies were not performed in compliance with applicable GLP rules and regulations, the FDA may request additional preclinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved.
 
If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, it may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the product. In addition, the FDA may in some circumstances impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer.  The FDA also may require prior approval of promotional materials.
      The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter describes the specific deficiencies in the submission identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or more significant, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA also may impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer.  Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.  Moreover, the FDA may require prior approval of promotional materials. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved drug or biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, the FDA review period can be lengthy and is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
     Following receipt of regulatory approval, any products that we market continue to be subject to extensive regulation including, among other things, record-keeping requirements; reporting of adverse experiences with the product; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; product storage, sampling and distribution requirements; complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label” use, and requirements relating to industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including the manufacture, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping related to the products. The FDA also frequently requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or places conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, disgorgement of money, civil injunctions, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.    The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, enacted in 2010, was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The law thus included changes that significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA and its implementing regulations impose federal reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to covered recipients, including physicians, teaching hospitals, advanced-practice nurses and physician assistants. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers also are required to report investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission.
 The ACA also established: an annual nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increased the rebates that a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In December 2017, portions of the ACA dealing with the individual mandate insurance requirement were effectively repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and other aspects of the ACA may be altered or repealed by future legislation. In December 2018, a U.S. federal district court judge in Texas found the ACA’s individual mandate to be unconstitutional and therefore the entire law to be invalid. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the ruling regarding the individual mandate, but remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis of the question of severability and whether portions of the law remain invalid. The case is currently under consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court, and a decision is expected by the summer of 2021.  
 In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, including several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and patient assistance programs, reduce the cost of drugs under federal and state healthcare programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Any changes at the federal or state level to drug pricing or reimbursement policies could affect our ability to successfully commercialize approved products.
 Additionally, several states require pharmaceutical companies to report information to state agencies, including information relating to drug pricing, marketing and promotion expenses, and gifts and payments to individual health care providers in the states. Other states limit or prohibit certain marketing related activities. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Additional states may consider similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. If in the future some of our business activities were subject to challenge under one or more of such laws, an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace. 
  The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These “off-label” uses are not unusual across certain medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. Federal regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Federal regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to delay its approval, and could result in other consequences such as recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions, civil or criminal prosecution or penalties, or other possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, seizure of product, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity. Any of these consequences could harm our business.
 
We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Our collaborators may also utilize third-parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Emergency Use Authorization
 The Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, authority allows the FDA to temporarily authorize emergency use of unapproved drugs, biologics and medical devices, or approved drugs, biologics and medical devices for unapproved uses.  FDA may authorize emergency use of products when the Secretary of Health and Human Services has made a declaration that the circumstances justifying emergency use exist, which itself may be made on the basis of a determination regarding a domestic emergency, military emergency, or public health emergency made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, respectively, or on the basis of the identification of a material threat under the Public Health Service Act.   Such emergencies and threats generally are determined to exist on the basis of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear, or CBRN, agent or agents, or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent or agents.

     An EUA authorized medical product may be used to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by a CBRN agent. The FDA may issue an EUA if it determines that (i) a product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a disease or condition, (ii) the known and potential benefits of a product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, (iii) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating such disease or condition, and if other regulatory criteria are met.  An EUA request must be submitted by the product sponsor and generally includes a summary of the available scientific evidence regarding the product's safety and effectiveness, risks (including an adverse event profile) and benefits, and any available, approved alternatives to the product. Also included are manufacturing information and fact sheets that convey important information about the product.  Even if a product is authorized for emergency use, the FDA may revoke an EUA if it determines that circumstances justifying emergency use no longer exist, the criteria for authorization are no longer met, or other circumstances justify revocation of the authorization.  There are no assurances that, if we seek an EUA for any of our products, any EUAs will be granted or approved for any of our products.    Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
New drug products may obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to a Section 505(b)(1) NDA filing or a 505(b)(2) NDA filing.  Whereas a 505(b)(1) NDA requires that the applicant must support its application with its own information or information to which it has a right of reference, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.     In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA information about each patent that claims the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug, and for which a claim of patent infringement reasonably could be asserted. Upon approval of a drug, information about each of those patents is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
 To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on published literature relating to a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, where the underlying studies were not conducted by or for the applicant and the applicant lacks a right of reference or use to the underlying data, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit in its Section 505(b)(2) application a patent certification or statement with respect to any patents that are subject to the Orange Book listing requirement in connection with the previously approved product on which the applicant’s application relies. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each such patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. Alternatively, with respect to a method of use patent, the applicant may submit a statement that the patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification or submit a statement that a method of use patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents for the previously approved product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve a Section 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
 If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, unless, before the end of the 30-month period, a court determines that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed; the patent owner or exclusive licensee consents to approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or the court enters an order of dismissal without a finding of infringement. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted during the final year of a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation.

As a result, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of a product and our Section 505(b)(2) applications only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the prior NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time, assuming the application is otherwise approvable. 
 Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last several years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
 We successfully pursued a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3 mg product and our lower dose 0.15 mg version; we are pursuing a Section 505(b)(2) application in connection with our ZIMHI naloxone injection product; and we may pursue Section 505(b)(2) applications in connection with other product candidates as appropriate, if successfully developed. Accordingly, if we rely in our section 505(b)(2) application on published literature or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product for which patents are listed in the Orange Book, and if the underlying studies were not conducted by or for us and we lack a right of reference or use to the underlying data, then we will need to submit an appropriate patent certification or statement for each such patent as described above. If we make a Paragraph IV certification and the holder of the previously approved product that we referenced in our application initiates patent litigation within the time periods described above, then we will be subject to the risks of patent litigation, with the accompanying delay described above and potentially material expense of patent litigation, before we could commercially market our product.    In addition, even if we submit a Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on published literature or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved product where there are no patents for such other product with respect to which we have to provide a patent certification or statement, we are subject to the risk that the FDA could disagree with our reliance on the particular previously approved product that we chose to rely on, conclude that such previously approved product is not an acceptable reference product, and require us instead to reference another previously approved product for which patents are listed in the Orange Book, requiring us to make an appropriate patent certification or statement as described above and subjecting us to the risks of delay and expense described above.      Abbreviated New Drug Applications    In contrast to the kind of clinical trial and other data that is required for an NDA submitted pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, contains data that, when submitted to the FDA pursuant to Section 505(j) of the FDCA, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a product commonly referred to as a “generic equivalent” or a “generic” drug product. These kinds of drug applications are called “abbreviated” because ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct or submit preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness of their product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Instead, a generic applicant must scientifically demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent, that is, that the product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. For locally acting inhaled products, we believe that demonstration of bioequivalence in most cases will require human clinical studies that demonstrate that the generic product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.    In seeking approval for a new drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA information about each patent that claims the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, information about each of those patents is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be referenced by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The ANDA applicant is required to submit to the FDA an appropriate certification or statement concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, in a manner generally similar to the certification or statement that is required in connection with Section 505(b)(2) applications as described above. As with Section 505(b)(2) applications, if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents and has not submitted a statement that a method of use patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, then the procedures described above in connection with Section 505(b)(2) applications also apply, and the risks of the patent holder initiating a patent infringement lawsuit as described above also apply. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing a new chemical entity, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV certification to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that does not contain a new chemical entity, but is approved, for example, in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was supported by new clinical trials (other than bioavailability studies) that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to approval of the application, during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA referencing that listed drug for the conditions of approval supported by the new clinical trials.     Regulation Outside the United States
If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our clinical trials or drugs will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa.     Additional Regulation 
     Third-Party Reimbursement
In the United States, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase pharmaceutical products generally rely on third-party payors, principally private health insurance plans, Medicare, or Medicaid, to reimburse the cost of the product and procedure for which the product is being used with varying degrees of patient cost sharing. Even if a product is approved for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the product and related medical procedures. If they do not, end-users of the product generally would not be eligible for any reimbursement of the cost, and our ability to successfully market any such product would be materially and adversely impacted. The level of reimbursement also varies significantly by payor and setting of care, and inadequate reimbursement also could materially and adversely impact our ability to successfully market our products. 
 Reimbursement systems vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region, and coverage and reimbursement for our products must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control or other mechanisms, including health technology assessments, mandatory rebates, and reference pricing. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, establishing coverage and reimbursement could take significant additional time. As in the United States, the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit their widespread use and lower potential product revenues.

 Fraud and Abuse Laws and Reporting Laws    In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws may restrict certain research and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to various arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other entities, including arrangements where any one purpose of the remuneration was a prohibited inducement under the Statute even if the primary purpose was compensation of legitimate services. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Recent regulations finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services have amended existing safe harbors or added new safe harbors, and certain of these regulations are subject to ongoing litigation.  Additionally, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, as amended, and other federal laws. Compliance with these fraud and abuse and reporting requirements requires significant resources. We could be required to devote significant additional financial resources and management attention if we ever become the focus of an investigation for failure to comply with these requirements.
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, including any claim submitted in violation of fraud and abuse and reporting requirements, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can constitute false or fraudulent claims under the False Claims Act. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may violate the False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or by a private individual acting as an informer or whistleblower in the name of the government, and violations can result in significant monetary penalties. The federal government has used the civil False Claims Act, and the threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers, suppliers and drug and device manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of drug and device marketing and research practices, and has obtained large settlements. Numerous pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been pursued under this law, including for allegedly inflating drug prices used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. There is also a criminal False Claims Act, which prohibits making or presenting any false, fictitious or fraudulent claims to the government and authorizes penalties including imprisonment and fines for individuals and organizations. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Federal and state authorities may continue to devote substantial resources toward investigating healthcare providers’, suppliers’ and drug and device manufacturers’ compliance with these and other fraud and abuse and reporting requirements.     HIPAA
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, addresses the privacy and transmission of individually identifiable health information and, among other things, requires the use of standard transactions, imposes privacy and security standards and requires breach notification, by covered entities, which include many healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Material monetary penalties and other remedies can result from violation of these laws and regulations. In addition, many state laws also address the privacy and security of health information, and many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, the European Union, or EU, has a separate data security and privacy legal framework, including the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which was adopted in 2018, which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information.  To the extent that we conduct clinical trials in the EU or otherwise expand our business operations to include operations in the EU, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR.

 Other Laws
We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, and various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding, among other things, occupational safety, the use and handling of radioisotopes, environmental protection and hazardous substance control. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals that cause cancer, volatile solvents, radioactive materials and biological materials that have the potential to transmit disease, and our operations may produce hazardous waste. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial financial liability or be required to suspend or modify our operations. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources.
   In addition, as an owner and operator of real property, we may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us, even if such contamination was not caused by us, as well as to claims for harm to health or property or for natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. Liability in many situations may be imposed not only without regard to fault, but may also be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share. We may also be subject to similar liabilities and claims in connection with locations at which hazardous substances or wastes that we have generated have been stored, treated, otherwise managed or disposed. The costs of complying with, or other impact of, current or future environmental, health and safety requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
       Outsourcing Facility Regulation     Our compounding business conducted by USC is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: laws relating to federal registration as an outsourcing facility; state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of outsourcing facilities; HIPAA; ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; statutes and regulations of the FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA; and state laws and regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the preparation, sale, advertisement and promotion of drugs that USC sells. Some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact USC’s operations are described below.
 USC’s compounding operations are regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing compounding operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding outsourcing facility operations. Many states license outsourcing facilities as pharmacies and apply pharmacy regulations to them.  These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state’s board of pharmacy.

In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, requirements on compounding pharmacies and on outsourcing facilities. Revisions to United States Pharmacopeia Chapters <800> “Hazardous Drugs – Handling in Healthcare Setting,” <795> “Pharmaceutical Compounding – Non-Sterile Preparations,” and <797> “Pharmaceutical Compounding – Sterile Preparations” were published in July 2019. As of the date of this Report, the effective dates of the revised chapters USP <795> and USP <797> have been postponed indefinitely. New and revised chapter USP <800> is incorporated by reference in some state regulations, and compliance with these revisions may require significant changes to procedures, policies, and facility design. If our compounding operations become subject to additional licensure requirements or, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on outsourcing facilities regulated by the states as pharmacies, USC's ability to operate in some states could be limited. As of the date of this Report, there are no operating restrictions on USC’s licensure in any of the states where it is licensed that we believe would have a material adverse effect on us.  
 Most of the states into which USC delivers its formulations have laws and regulations that require out-of-state outsourcing facilities, at times regulated as pharmacies, to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the outsourcing facility regulated as a pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state outsourcing facilities regulated as pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state outsourcing facility regulated as a pharmacy dispenses or distributes medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the outsourcing facility is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state.
 Section 503B of the FDCA was enacted as part of the DQSA to establish an outsourcing facility as a new entity that is permitted to compound large quantities of drug formulations without a prescription and distribute them without limitation on the volume that may be shipped out of state.  Section 503B includes conditions relating to registration and reporting, use of bulk drug substances in compounding, compounding copies of FDA-approved drugs, wholesaling, and labeling, among others. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspection, among other requirements. USC currently operates as a 503B outsourcing facility, and we cannot predict when FDA will issue, finalize, or enforce new rules and guidance documents that affect our business practices. Several rules and guidance documents from FDA are currently in proposed or draft form, and we cannot predict or control when final rules and final guidance might be issued or if any changes from the proposed or draft versions will be introduced. 
 Since 2012, the FDA has convened a number of inter-governmental working meetings with government officials from each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, to discuss topics such as oversight of compounding, including the implementation of the DQSA, and opportunities to better protect public health by strengthening oversight of compounders through improved collaboration between the FDA and the states. As a result of such meetings, the FDA and the states committed, among other things, to enhance inter-agency communication surrounding the implementation of the DQSA, which may lead to additional guidance or regulation in the future.  If federal, state or local regulatory authorities place new restrictions or limitations on USC’s or our operations, USC’s or our business, financial conditions or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
 USC’s 503B outsourcing facility operations must continually adhere to applicable cGMP requirements, which are issued and enforced by the FDA through regulations and guidance and interpreted and enforced through its inspection programs.  In July 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance for cGMPs for human drug compounding outsourcing facilities, such as USC’s. This draft guidance was revised in December 2018, and in January 2020 the FDA published a second revised draft guidance on cGMP requirements. USC has assessed this revised draft guidance and is implementing pertinent improvements or changes to its processes, procedures, policies, or facility to achieve the expected level of compliance. Because this cGMP draft guidance has not been finalized and may be significantly changed prior to being made final, we may need to expend substantial additional resources to comply with the final applicable cGMPs, along with any additional modifications over time.

In January 2018, the FDA published a statement outlining its compounding priorities for 2018, or the 2018 Compounding Plan, which provided an overview of the key priorities the FDA planned to focus on in 2018 in connection with compounding regulations. Included in the 2018 Compounding Plan were references to forthcoming regulations on compounding from bulk drug substances, determination of clinical need, and a revised memorandum of understanding between the FDA and State Boards of Pharmacy setting forth limits on interstate compounding under Section 503A of the FDCA. In keeping with this 2018 Compounding Plan, in March 2018 the FDA issued a draft guidance proposing a framework for determining the clinical need sufficient to permit an outsourcing facility to compound from bulk drug substances (“Bulks Guidance”). The Bulks Guidance received numerous comments, and final guidance was published in March 2019 relating to the method by which the FDA will evaluate bulk drug substances for inclusion/exclusion on the final bulk substances lists (“Bulks List”). In September 2019, Endo International plc (“Endo”), a pharmaceutical company, withdrew a lawsuit based on the FDA’s formal action to exclude vasopressin (and one other substance) from the Bulks List, the basis of Endo’s complaint. Since then, FDA has published two subsequent notices to the Federal Register that propose to exclude an additional 28, while moving to include four, substances. As of this date of this Report, FDA has yet to take final action on these two proposals and no timeline is currently available by which the lists are expected to be finalized.
 Among the 28 bulk substances FDA has proposed to exclude from the Bulks List is ephedrine sulfate. Ephedrine sulfate represents a portion of USC’s hospital outsourcing business, which could result in a loss of revenue resulting from affected USC products. USC is working proactively with industry stakeholders and regulatory authorities regarding the FDA’s guidance and actions. Until FDA makes a final determination on its Bulks List proposals, the interim bulk substances lists are effective, and USC does not compound with bulk drug substances not on the interim list as approved for use.  We believe that the impact on USC and other 503B outsourcing facilities of the regulatory expectations regarding bulk substances will depend in part on how the guidance is implemented, interpreted, and applied over time.
 The DQSA prohibits compounding facilities from compounding products that are considered "essentially a copy" of approved drug products offered by traditional pharmaceutical manufacturers. In January 2018, the FDA published Final Guidance on what it considers to be "essentially a copy" of approved drug products for outsourcing facilities. This guidance documents added the requirement that purchasers and prescribers document on each order and prescription the specific clinical need for the compounded medication. Some purchasers and prescribers may be unwilling to complete this additional documentation, resulting in decreased demand for the compounded drug products. In 2021, the FDA plans to issue a revised draft guidance on compounded drug products that are essentially copies of approved drug products under Section 503B of the FDCA, the prohibition on wholesaling under Section 503B, and safety considerations for Section 503B container labels and carton labeling design to minimize medication errors. This new or revised guidance could have an adverse impact on USC's business. 
 In November 2019, the FDA issued a draft Guidance for Industry #256: Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances, or the Draft GFI #256. This guidance describes the FDA’s policy regarding the compounding of animal drugs from bulk substances and limits the circumstances in which a compounder may use bulk substances to compound animal medication.  Industry comments to the Draft GFI #256 were due by October 15, 2020. No official action has been taken to date. As with other FDA regulations and guidance, when finalized, this guidance could limit the number and type of products USC is permitted to compound for animal use.
 USC is currently compounding animal medication in its registered Section 503B outsourcing facility.  Section 503B of the FDCA does not apply to animal medication and FDA does not expressly allow 503B registered outsourcing facilities to compound animal medication. However, FDA’s August 2015 guidance on whether an entity should register as an outsourcing facility contemplates that outsourcing facilities will be compounding animal medication in addition to human medication, and FDA has not taken action to date against a Section 503B registered outsourcing facility that is compounding both human and animal medications.  Nevertheless, as FDA has not expressly stated its position on the compounding of animal medication in a 503B outsourcing facility, there is a risk that FDA could, in the future, consider animal medication compounded in a 503B outsourcing facility to not be exempt from new drug approval requirements, and enforce new drug approval requirements on animal medication compounding in Section 503B outsourcing facilities.

 Compliance Matters. Compounding pharmacies have historically been subject to FDA inspections on an irregular basis, whereas outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspections on a risk-based schedule in accordance with DQSA Section 503B(b)(4). Observations by the FDA of potentially violative conditions during inspections are required to be reported to facility management at the close of the inspection on Form FDA 483 (Form 483). It is common for such forms to be provided in connection with inspections of compounding outsourcing facilities, and observations may be further followed by Warning Letters and other enforcement actions as the FDA deems warranted. In March 2014, August 2015, July 2016, and February 2019, USC received Form 483s following FDA inspections of its outsourcing facility, noting inspectional observations of a number of observed potential deficiencies relating to USC’s facility and practices.
 Following the August 2015 Form 483 observations, and prior to our acquisition of USC, USC temporarily suspended production of sterile products and voluntarily recalled certain lots of sterile product. USC determined there was no evidence that any compounded sterile products were defective but decided to voluntarily recall all sterile product that remained within expiry and temporarily halt sterile production. USC responded to the August 2015 Form 483 observations and took a number of corrective actions, including enhancing quality control and production systems. Approximately around the time of its acquisition by Adamis, USC resumed production and sale of its sterile products. In July 2016, USC received a Form 483 following FDA inspection of its outsourcing facility, noting inspectional observations of a number of observed deficiencies relating to USC’s facility and practices. USC responded in writing to the inspectional observations in July 2016 and provided supplemental responses to FDA in April 2017. In October 2017, USC received a Warning Letter referencing the August 2015 and July 2016 Form 483 inspectional observations. USC provided a written response to the FDA that further described the completed corrective actions that were taken in response to the inspectional observations.  In November 2018, FDA responded to the 2017 Warning Letter response submitted by USC and indicated it would look for evidence of corrective action and further clarification of policies and procedures on a future inspection. USC was inspected by FDA in the early part of 2019, with a Form 483 issued to site management in February 2019. USC duly responded to the inspectional observations in writing to the FDA in March 2019, and provided an initial update in April 2019 and a comprehensive update of completed corrective actions and milestones in August 2019. In August 2020, USC received a Regulatory Meeting Letter from FDA as a follow up to USC’s correspondence and corrective actions related to the February 2019 Form 483. In October 2020, USC responded to the requests made in the Regulatory Meeting Letter and provided a supplemental response in January 2021. USC is scheduled to complete this Regulatory Meeting with FDA in April 2021 to determine the efficacy of USC’s corrective actions. If FDA is not satisfied with the efficacy of USC’s corrective actions, then after the Regulatory Meeting, FDA could take enforcement action, which could include a request that USC cease operations or recall product. Any enforcement action may adversely affect USC’s and our business, results of operations, and financial condition.     Following the suspension and voluntary recall in 2015, state pharmacy regulatory agencies in certain states initiated inquiries or took other actions regarding sales of USC products in such states. All of those state matters relating to the suspension and voluntary recall have been resolved; however, future proceedings by the FDA or state regulatory agencies alleging violation of applicable federal or state laws or regulations could require significant time and financial resources, and an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could adversely affect USC's and our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We cannot predict when or if we will receive additional Form 483 observations or other communications from the FDA or state regulatory authorities regarding USC’s compounding outsourcing facility or compounded drugs. We could be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA and civil or criminal enforcement action by the Department of Justice under the FDCA, Federal False Claims Act, or other applicable statutes, as well as related private actions, as a result of previous, current or future FDA observations. USC’s suppliers and customers may negatively consider the Form 483 observations issued to us when deciding to award contracts or continue or renew agreements. Other state and federal regulators and agencies may also consider the Form 483 observations when conducting their own inspections, enforcement actions or approvals, including license renewals. Any such actions could significantly disrupt USC’s business and harm its and our reputation, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA   To the extent that USC’s outsourcing facility operations, may involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential individually identifiable medical, pharmacy and other health-related information, it may be subject to HIPAA. The federal privacy regulations under HIPAA are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires implementation of security safeguards regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to electronic protected health information. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information. The European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures that are intended to bring non-EU companies under the data security and privacy legal framework specified in the regulation. If we expand our business operations to include operations in the European Union, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR. 
 Additionally, effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, created individual privacy rights for California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and placed increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provides such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA and its implementing regulations have already been amended since their enactment.  These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may impose limitations on our activities or otherwise adversely affect our business. The CCPA could impact our business activities and create additional risks relating to cyber security and the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. 
 Reimbursement
Currently, most of USC’s formulations are sold in cash transactions. Compounded formulations sold by USC may not qualify for reimbursement by third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid. Further, healthcare reform efforts generally may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could adversely affect USC’s business. As a result, reimbursement from third-party payors may never be available for any of USC’s products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow USC to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points.
Drug Enforcement Administration 
 USC maintains registrations with the DEA that enable USC to receive, manufacture, store and distribute controlled substances. Under federal law, controlled substances include any drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, that appears on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. DEA drug scheduling is based on the drug’s acceptable medical use and the potential for abuse and dependence. Laws enforced by the DEA, as well as similar laws enforced by state agencies, require each location that handles controlled substances to separately register.
  The CSA governs, among other things, the ordering, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. USC’s compounding outsourcing facilities that handle controlled substances are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with federal and state controlled substances laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation, or a denial or renewal, of any DEA or state registration, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.

 Procurement quota requirements imposed by the DEA on USC’s purchases of materials containing certain controlled substances necessitate regular applications to the DEA for permission to purchase materials essential to the production of many of USC’s CSPs. Any inability to obtain authorization from the DEA to procure controlled substances for use in USC’s business, or a reduction in USC’s quota, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA also establishes aggregate production quotas for certain controlled substances. In 2016, the DEA issued a statement indicating it would significantly decrease the amount of opioid controlled substances to be manufactured in 2017 in an effort to curb the national opioid abuse crisis. DEA announced further reductions for 2018, 2019 and 2020, though the DEA adjusted the 2020 quotas for opioid production in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Future decreases could limit USC’s ability to procure controlled substances and adversely impact our revenues and results of operations; however, USC works with both the DEA and customers to address these issues. 
 Environmental and Other Matters    USC is or may become subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by USC of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with research and preparation of compounded formulations. USC is subject to work safety and labor laws that govern certain of its operations and employee relations. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other federal, state, and local government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, licenses or permits, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.      Employees and Human Capital Resources          As of December 31, 2020, we had 116 full-time employees, including one located outside of the United States, and 27 part-time employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 
Our human capital management goals include, as applicable, identifying, attracting, retaining, and incentivizing our employees, directors and consultants. We seek to create a safe, supportive, and rewarding work environment and to align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction.  Our equity and cash compensation and incentive plans are primarily intended to attract, retain and motivate personnel through compensation and equity-based and cash-based compensation awards, with a goal of increasing the success of our company.
 
COVID-19.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented safety protocols to mitigate the risks of infection to our employees. During 2020, our COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response was a focus. Our pandemic response measures incorporate guidance issued by external health authorities and are designed with the goal of keeping workers at our facilities safe and healthy.
