Overview
POINT Biopharma Global Inc. is a next-generation radioligand company. Our mission is to accelerate the discovery, development and global access to targeted radioligand therapies. In pursuit of this mission, we have built a platform for the clinical development and commercialization of next-generation radioligands. Our platform consists of a strong pipeline of potential first-in-class and best-in-class assets, internal research and development expertise, in-house manufacturing capabilities, and a secured supply for rare medical isotopes like actinium-225 ("225Ac") and lutetium-177 ("177Lu").
Our product pipeline consists of late-stage programs in prostate cancer (PNT2002) and neuroendocrine tumors (PNT2003), as well as an early-stage portfolio of next-generation programs (for example, PNT2001, PNT2004). Our late-stage programs are 177Lu-based radioligands. For our early-stage development programs, we plan to evaluate the utility of both 177Lu and 225Ac, as well as other isotopes that may be considered for use in radioligands. 
Our management team brings decades of combined experience in targeted radioligand therapy clinical development and manufacturing. Our 100% company-owned radioligand manufacturing facility, located in Indianapolis, Indiana, is currently operational and supplying 177Lu-PNT2002 drug product for our phase 3 SPLASH trial. We have also assembled one of the radiopharmaceutical industry’s most redundant isotope supply chains, with in-house manufacturing of isotopes such as no-carrier-added ("n.c.a.") 177Lu expected to commence by the end of 2023.
With recent innovations in the production and purification of medical isotopes, radioligand development is progressing faster than ever before; we believe POINT is well-positioned to be a leader in this rapidly advancing field.
Strategic Collaboration with Lantheus Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LNTH)
In November 2022, POINT announced strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreements (the "Lantheus License Agreements") with Lantheus Holdings Inc. ("Lantheus") for exclusive worldwide rights for 177Lu-PNT2002 and 177Lu-PNT2003, excluding certain territories (Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, and China including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). The collaboration pairs POINT's expertise in next-generation radioligand therapy development and manufacturing with Lantheus’ commercial leadership in prostate-specific membrane antigen - positron emission tomography ("PSMA-PET") and radiopharmaceuticals. 
In December 2022, closing conditions for the transaction, including Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance, were met. For 177Lu-PNT2002, POINT has received a $250 million upfront payment. POINT will also receive an additional payment of up to $250 million upon U.S. regulatory approval, and, once certain return on investment financial thresholds have been achieved and other conditions met, royalties of 20% on all net sales (prior to which there is a period of sales in which the royalty may be based on only a portion of the gross profit), as well as the potential for up to an additional $1.3 billion in various net sales milestone payments. For 177Lu-PNT2003, POINT has received a $10 million upfront payment, and will receive up to an additional $30 million upon U.S. regulatory approval, royalties of 15% on net sales, as well as the potential for up to an additional $275 million in various net sales milestone payments.
Joint steering committees have been formed to oversee the clinical studies, regulatory filings, manufacturing, and commercial readiness for both 177Lu-PNT2002 and 177Lu-PNT2003. As per the strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreements, Lantheus will be responsible for all subsequent development of the assets post initial regulatory filings within the U.S., and for all development efforts in their territories.
Product Pipeline Summary:
PNT2002 Program
177Lu-PNT2002 is a late-stage prostate-specific membrane antigen ("PSMA") targeted radioligand therapy currently in a phase 3 trial sponsored by POINT. 177Lu-PNT2002 combines a PSMA-specific ligand, PSMA-I&T, with the beta-emitting radioisotope 177Lu ("177Lu-PSMA-I&T"). 
The multi-center, randomized, open label phase 3 Study evaluating metastatic castration-resistant Prostate cancer ("mCRPC") using 177Lu-PNT2002 PSMA therapy After Second-line Hormonal treatment ("SPLASH") trial assesses 177Lu-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PNT2002 in participants with PSMA-expressing mCRPC who have progressed on androgen receptor pathway inhibitor, ("ARPI"), therapy and are ineligible or averse to chemotherapy. The study has two phases: 1) a 25-participant safety and dosimetry lead-in study (with follow-up ongoing) and 2) an approximately 400-participant randomized study (which is still ongoing). The randomization phase of the study started enrolling in September 2021. In December 2022, the target enrollment for randomization was achieved on schedule with more than 390 participants randomized across 55 SPLASH trial sites in North America, the European Union (the "E.U."), and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). We expect to report top line data from SPLASH in the second half of 2023.
In November 2022, POINT announced a strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreements for the commercialization of 177Lu-PNT2002 with Lantheus. Under the Lantheus License Agreements, Lantheus will be responsible for all subsequent development of the asset post initial regulatory filings within the U.S., and for all development efforts in their territories.
PNT2003 Program
177Lu-PNT2003 is a late-stage somatostatin-targeted radioligand in development for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. 177Lu-PNT2003 combines a somatostatin-specific radioligand called DOTATATE with n.c.a. 177Lu. 177Lu-PNT2003’s use of n.c.a. 177Lu could avoid the need for clinics to maintain costly dedicated waste streams, providing a unique advantage over the currently approved radioligand product for the gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ("GEP-NETs") indication. The clinical trial involving 177Lu-PNT2003 is being sponsored by the University Health Network ("UHN") with collaboration from Canadian Molecular Probe Consortium ("CanProbe"), Ozmosis Research Inc., and Cancer Care Ontario (OZM-067; NCT02743741). The last patient last dose for OZM-067 occurred in July 2021, all participants completed the primary follow-up period in the second quarter of 2022; long-term follow-up is ongoing.
In November 2022, POINT announced strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreements for the commercialization of 177Lu-PNT2003 with Lantheus. Following the strategic collaboration announcement, POINT received the OZM-067 clinical trial data sets from the trial sponsor, UHN. POINT will facilitate the analysis of the data sets. Under the Lantheus License Agreements, Lantheus will be responsible for all subsequent development of the asset post initial regulatory filings within the U.S., and for all development efforts in their territories.
PNT2004 Program
PNT2004 is a fibroblast activation protein-α ("FAP") targeting program being developed for use in multiple tumor types. FAP is a compelling pan cancer target for imaging and therapy that is expressed in >90% of epithelial tumors. In cancer, FAP is over-expressed on cancer associated fibroblasts ("CAF"s), as well as on certain cancer cells of mesenchymal origin, and its expression is understood to be involved in mechanisms driving tumor progression and resistance to chemo and immunotherapy. FAP is a 170 kDa membrane bound prolyl endopeptidase that is expressed almost exclusively to pathological conditions with known effects on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. POINT believes the D-ala-boroPro warhead, which is the core of the PNT2004 program, has the potential to generate best-in-class FAP-targeting ligands. 177Lu-PNT6555, the clinical lead, has demonstrated compelling tumor retention and normal tissue clearance in preclinical models, enabling delivery of large doses of tumor killing radiation.
POINT filed a clinical trial application (CTA) with Health Canada at the end of the first quarter of 2022 for 177Lu-PNT6555. A No Objection Letter, or authorization to proceed, was received from Health Canada in May 2022. The phase 1 clinical trial commenced in July 2022 in Canada and uses a gallium-68 (68Ga)-based PNT6555 molecular imaging agent to select patients to receive a n.c.a. 177Lu-based PNT6555 therapeutic agent. The FAPi Radioligand OpeN-Label, phase 1 study to evaluate safety, Tolerability and dosImetry of 177Lu-PNT6555; a dose Escalation study for tReatment of patients with select solid tumors, ("FRONTIER"), protocol evaluates PNT6555 with dosing starting at 4 gigabecquerel ("GBq") and each subsequent dose level increasing by 4 GBq, also allowing for 2 GBq dose de-escalations. Estimated enrollment across the multiple dosing levels is up to 30 participants in five FAP-avid cancer indications: colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. 
Enrollment in cohort 2 began in December 2022 and cohort 3 enrollment is expected to begin in the second quarter 2023. A total of six participants have been dosed with 177Lu PNT6555 to date. We anticipate data from the full FRONTIER trial to be available in the first half of 2024.
In November, 2022, preclinical data supporting the combination of 177Lu-PNT6555 with immunotherapy was released via a press release. The preclinical study focused on assessing the potential of the lead candidate in the PNT2004 clinical program, 177Lu-PNT6555, in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The CT26-mFAP tumor model used expresses low levels of FAP, grows aggressively, and is insensitive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The study found that combination

treatment with 177Lu-PNT6555 and anti-PD-1 resulted in a significant survival benefit, as compared to either treatment independently.
PNT2001 Program
The PNT2001 program encompasses a next-generation PSMA-targeting ligand family which leverages linker technology that promotes increased internalization of the ligand which has translated into increased tumor accumulation in preclinical models versus PSMA-I&T. The lead candidate in the program, 225Ac-PSMA-62, shows compelling efficacy as a single dose in preclinical tumor models, with potent anti-tumor activity using 225Ac, while also having an improved biodistribution profile versus the PSMA ligands that are currently approved, or in later-stage development. This profile could result in increased efficacy at a lower dose, potentially allowing for a reduction in the radioligand dose needed and improved patient outcomes. 
In October 2022, POINT published new preclinical data from the PNT2001 program. The new PNT2001 data were shared in E-poster #039, “Development and characterization of a next-generation 225Ac-PMSA radioligand,” at the 35th Annual Congress of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) in Barcelona, Spain. 
POINT is planning to advance the candidate into investigational new drug ("IND")-enabling studies with the aim of pursuing clinical development of 225Ac-PSMA-62 in the biochemically recurrent, oligometastatic, and post-177Lu-PSMA mCRPC populations. POINT is targeting an IND/CTA submission to support initiation of the first-in-human, phase 1 study in the first half 2023.
CanSEEK
CanSEEK™ is a prodrug technology that has the potential to prevent target engagement outside of the tumor microenvironment ("TME"), which could significantly improve the therapeutic index of targeted radioligand therapy. CanSEEK™ is based on the (d)-Ala-Pro FAP substrate technology, which works by preventing a radioligand from binding to the target receptor until it has been activated by FAP in the TME. Multiple (d)-Ala-Pro substrate enabled ligands are being studied preclinically against different targets. If successful, the platform has the potential to significantly improve the precision and safety of radioligands. POINT’s CanSEEKTM technology is the subject of licenses from both Bach Biosciences, LLC ("Bach Biosciences") and Avacta Life Sciences Limited ("Avacta").

Background on Prostate Cancer and PSMA targeting
The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing as the U.S. population ages into older at-risk groups. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately-288,300 new prostate cancer cases and over 34,700 deaths due to prostate cancer in the U.S. in 2023. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men, and with a significant mortality rate, is the second leading cause of cancer death in males in the U.S. In Europe, across the E.U.-27 countries, the European Cancer Information System estimated that there were approximately 335,000 new prostate cancer cases and over 69,000 deaths as a result of prostate cancer in 2020. In these countries, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males and is the third leading cause of cancer death in men.
PSMA is a unique membrane-bound glycoprotein that is over-expressed in prostate cancer but has low expression in normal healthy tissue. Furthermore, PSMA is highly expressed in all states of prostate cancer, including primary and poorly differentiated, metastatic and castrate-resistant disease. This unique expression of PSMA provides the opportunity to design treatments that can be precisely targeted to safely enable the delivery of highly potent drug payloads, while sparing normal healthy tissue. In addition, companion imaging agents are approved and can be used to identify individuals whose disease over-expresses PSMA. In December 2020, the FDA approved the first drug for positron emission tomography ("PET") imaging of PSMA-positive lesions in individuals with prostate cancer, 68Ga-PSMA-11. In May 2021, the FDA approved the second PET imaging agent for PSMA imaging, 18F-DCFPyL, commercialized by Lantheus Medical Imaging. Subsequently, in December 2021, the FDA approved Telix Pharmaceuticals’ kit for the preparation of 68Ga-PSMA-11. POINT believes the approval of PSMA-PET agents will facilitate broad access and permit the identification of individuals who are likely to benefit from PSMA-targeted treatments, including 177Lu-PNT2002.
Although the five-year survival rate of local and regional prostate cancer is nearly 100%, more aggressive forms of the disease, representing 22% of individuals at the time of initial diagnosis, have a substantially poorer prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of only 30%. While these more aggressive forms of prostate cancer can initially be treated, nearly all of these individuals experience a recurrence in tumor growth that results in the subsequent development of mCRPC. mCRPC is the most advanced form of the disease and recent estimates suggest a potential incidence of approximately 62,000 new cases of first line mCRPC in the U.S. per year. Individuals with mCRPC have a poor prognosis, from the time of diagnosis of mCRPC, the median overall survival is only 21.2 months (George et al., 2020). mCRPC represents nearly all prostate cancer-specific deaths.
ARPI therapies such as Zytiga® (abiraterone), Xtandi® (enzalutamide), Nubeqa® (darolutamide), or Erleada® (apalutamide) are now standard of care for both non-mCRPC and mCRPC following progression and failure on initial hormone therapy. Peak global annual sales of Johnson & Johnson’s Erleada® were $968 million in the U.S. plus an additional $913 million in international markets for a total of $1.88 billion in 2022. Astellas reported global annual sales of Xtandi® for year ended March 2022 exceeding ¥534.3 billion (approximately $3.9 billion). Finally, Bayer reported that Nubeqa® reached sales of €219.0 million (approximately $250 million) in 2021, driven by U.S. market over-performance, signaling a change in clinical preferences. 
In mCRPC, median radiographic progression-free survival ("rPFS") for first-line use of abiraterone was 16.5 months, with ~20% of participants having progressed by the sixth month. Median time that particpants received enzalutamide was 16.6 months with 16% having progressed by the sixth month. For most individuals, progression is inevitable and as a result there is a large unmet need upon failure of ARPI therapy. In spite of progression while on ARPI, a majority of individuals are offered an ARPI switch to avoid the increasingly toxic profile of chemotherapy. Two recent studies have shown that, when patients are switched to a second-line ARPI therapy, rPFS is only approximately four months (de Bono J, et al. N Engl J Med 2020; 382:2091-102, and Powles T, et al. Nature 2022;28:144–53). As a result, there continues to be a significant need for novel treatment options with the potential to modify or ultimately cure the disease.
POINT's Solution: 177Lu-PNT2002
177Lu-PNT2002 combines a PSMA-specific ligand with the beta-emitting radioisotope 177Lu. 177Lu-PNT2002’s ligand is referred to as “PSMA-I&T” in academic literature and has been used for many years in research and compassionate use

settings. PSMA-I&T was developed by Dr. Hans-Jürgen Wester at the Technische Universität München. We created the PNT2002 program by leveraging the data collected in an academic study on PSMA-I&T (Baum RP, et al. 177Lu-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: safety and efficacy), in combination with issued patents and provisional patents pertaining to the formation of the radioligand active pharmaceutical ingredient, the manufacturing process and the formulation of the finished product.
Current standard of care for individuals with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have failed androgen deprivation therapy ("ADT") and ARPI is chemotherapy. The side effects of chemotherapy are significant including neuropathies, nausea, diarrhea, decreased mental capacity and increased risk of infections. 177Lu-PNT2002 has the potential to offer an alternative with significantly fewer side effects compared to chemotherapy, leading to a higher quality of life.
A prospective clinical study by Baum, et al. focused on the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T in individuals with progressive mCRPC and increasing levels of prostate-specific antigen ("PSA"). Fifty-six participants were administered a dose of 3.6 to 8.7 GBq, per cycle for one to six cycles, and monitored for morphologic response, response in PSA levels, and overall change in clinical symptoms. Analysis with contrast-enhanced computed tomography ("CT") determined that 20%, 52%, and 28% of participants had partial remission, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. The PSA levels decreased in 80.4% of participants, with the median PSA level reduced from 43.2 ng/mL to 23.8 ng/mL pre- and post-therapy. Progression-free survival ("PFS") was a median of 13.7 months and the median overall survival was not reached after a 28-month follow-up period.
Participants were monitored for side effects for two to four days after each treatment, and vital signs were recorded during administration of the therapy. No clinically significant adverse events were reported during the early monitoring period (i.e., during therapy and for up to four days thereafter) or at the 28-month follow-up time point. Leukocytopenia (grades 1 or 2) occurred only in participants who had received prior long-term chemotherapy. Events of mild, reversible dry mouth, which resolved within three months, occurred in two participants after the third and fourth cycles. No evidence of nephrotoxicity was observed and no clinically significant changes in pre- to post-dosing lab parameters were identified.
POINT held regulatory discussions with the FDA in 2020, leveraging data in the literature. The FDA provided feedback on protocol design, dosing strategy, dosimetry, control arm, imaging agents and statistical approach regarding the clinical development plans for 177Lu-PNT2002. Leveraging feedback from the FDA, POINT filed an IND in December 2020 to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PNT2002. The IND was accepted in December 2020. Regulatory discussions were also held with Health Canada in December 2020. Following these discussions, POINT submitted a clinical trial application ("CTA") for the study and received a No Objection Letter from Health Canada in January 2021. CTAs were also filed and are active in four other countries.
Clinical Development and Next Steps
POINT initiated participant recruitment for our phase 3 SPLASH trial in February 2021, and we expect to report top line data from SPLASH in the second half of 2023. The randomization phase of the study started enrolling in September 2021, and in December 2022 the target enrollment for randomization was completed on schedule with more than 390 participants randomized across 55 SPLASH trial sites in North America, Europe, and the U.K. All participants undergo PSMA imaging as part of screening to confirm PSMA expression eligibility, as evaluated by central review. The study commenced with dosing 27 participants in the safety and dosimetry lead-in and proceeded to a randomization treatment phase in approximately 400 participants in September 2021 who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to: 177Lu-PNT2002 (Arm A) versus enzalutamide (160 mg orally qd) or abiraterone (1000 mg orally qd with: 5 mg bid prednisone or 0.5 mg qd dexamethasone) (Arm B). POINT anticipates that Arm B will result in a median PFS of approximately 5 months based on results in previous clinical studies (3.7 months, De Bono et al. N Engl J Med 2020; 382:2091-2102; 4.2 months: Powles T, et al. Nature 2022;28:144–53.). 
Participants in Arm A will receive a 6.8 GBq dose of 177Lu-PNT2002 for 4 cycles, 8 weeks apart, for a maximum cumulative dose of 27.2 GBq. Participants in Arm B may be eligible to crossover to 177Lu-PNT2002 every 8 weeks for 4 cycles after radiographic progression per central review. All participants will be followed in long-term follow-up for at least 5 years from the first therapeutic dose, or until death or loss to follow-up. The primary endpoint of the trial is rPFS. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate ("ORR") and overall survival.

In February 2022, POINT published dosimetry data from the 27 participants dosed in the safety and dosimetry lead-in cohort for the Company’s phase 3 SPLASH trial evaluating 177Lu-PNT2002 for the treatment of mCRPC at the 2022 SNMMI Mid-Winter and ACNM Annual Meeting on February 25-27, 2022. The abstract was made public on the first day of the conference. Radiation dosimetry of 177Lu-PNT2002 was calculated in 27 participants with mCRPC based on biodistribution data from planar whole-body conjugate imaging at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours and, for 7 of them, SPECT/CT imaging at 48-72 hours post injection of their first cycle of 177Lu-PNT2002 (6.8±10% GBq). Data from the abstract titled “Dosimetry Results from the SPLASH Trial” (Abstract #: MWMA2244) demonstrated the following:
•Organs receiving the largest absorbed doses were the lacrimal glands at 1.2 Gy/GBq, followed by the kidneys at 0.73 Gy/GBq.
•The average dose to the salivary glands and red marrow was 0.34 Gy/GBq and 0.034 Gy/GBq, respectively.
•For a cumulative administered activity of 27.2 GBq, (four cycles of 6.8 GBq) the kidneys would receive a cumulative absorbed dose of 19.9 Gy, and the red marrow, 0.91 Gy.
•SPECT/CT vs planar-based kidney dosimetry was consistent across most participants (±20%) where SPECT/CT images were available with a mean kidney absorbed dose difference of 1%.
In April 2022, POINT dosed the first E.U. participant in the SPLASH trial, and in September 2022, the Company published a poster at ESMO Congress 2022 containing updated efficacy and safety data from the 27-participant safety and dosimetry lead-in cohort for the phase 3 SPLASH trial (NCT04647526) evaluating 177Lu-PNT2002 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The poster is titled “Efficacy and Safety of 177Lu-PNT2002 Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Therapy in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC): Initial Results from SPLASH” (e-Poster #1400P). Key findings highlighted in the poster include:
•Median rPFS was 11.5 months, as compared to the control arm benchmarks of 3.5–4.2 months for individuals with progressive mCRPC post-ARPI failure receiving similar treatment (de Bono J, et al. N Engl J Med 2020; 382:2091-102.; Powles T, et al. Nature 2022;28:144–53.)
•Median overall survival had not been reached with an 11.7-month median duration of follow-up from time of enrollment.
•A radiographic objective response was achieved in 60% of the 10 participants with evaluable disease at baseline
•84.8% of individuals imaged met PSMA eligibility criteria.
•From a median baseline PSA (ng/mL) of 22 (range 0.3–701.0), 11 (42%) participants achieved a PSA50 response.
•177Lu-PNT2002 was well tolerated with no treatment-related deaths and few treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher.
•Treatment-related adverse events occurring in >10% of participants included dry mouth (25.9% of participants; all grade 1), fatigue (22.2%; grades 1-2), nausea (18.5%; grades 1-2), and anaemia (14.8%; grades 1-3).
In November 2022, POINT announced strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreements with Lantheus for exclusive worldwide rights for 177Lu-PNT2002, excluding certain territories (Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, and China including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). 
In December 2022, closing conditions for the transaction, including Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance, were met. For 177Lu-PNT2002, POINT has received a $250 million upfront payment. POINT will receive an additional payment up to $250 million upon U.S. regulatory approval, and, once certain return on investment financial thresholds have been achieved and other conditions met, royalties of 20% on net sales, as well as the potential for up to an additional $1.3 billion in various net sales milestone payments. 
Joint steering committees have been formed to oversee the clinical studies, regulatory filings, manufacturing, and commercial readiness for 177Lu-PNT2002. As per the strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreement, Lantheus will be responsible for all subsequent development of the asset post initial regulatory filings within the U.S., and for all development efforts in their territories.
The randomization phase of the study started enrolling in September 2021 and in December 2022 the target enrollment for randomization was completed on schedule with more than 390 participants randomized across 55 SPLASH trial sites in North America, Europe, and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). We expect to report top line data from SPLASH in the second half of 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Background on Neuroendocrine Tumors and Somastatin Targeting
Neuroendocrine tumors ("NETs") are rare, heterogenous tumors that originate in neuroendocrine cells, and frequently arise in the gastroenteropancreatic and respiratory systems. NETs are the second most common neoplasm of the diffuse endocrine system. Because of their low incidence and prevalence among the population, NETs are considered an orphan disease. However, there has been a trend towards rising incidence in recent years, especially for NETs located in the lungs, small intestine and rectum.
According to an analysis performed using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program research data, there was a prevalence of 187,000 people with NETs in the U.S. in 2016 and an estimate of 33,000 newly diagnosed cases. The American Society of Clinical Oncology estimates that 50% of the NETs originate in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, 30% in the lung and the remainder in various sites including the adrenal glands, thyroid and pituitary, among others.
GEP-NETs are a rare type of tumor that can form in the pancreas or in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum and appendix. GEP-NETs, sometimes called carcinoid tumors or islet cell tumors, usually form in cells that secrete hormones and can either be benign or malignant. Non-GEP-NETs, includes neuroendocrine tumors of the lung, thyroid, adrenal, ovary, kidney, pituitary, and unknown origin. The five- and ten-year overall survival for GEP-NETs is ~22 – ~56% and ~7 – ~28%, respectively, while individuals with metastatic disease have significantly worse ten-year overall survival across all NET subtypes than those with local disease. The five- and ten-year overall survival rates for lung NETs, which make up the majority of non-GEP-NETs, are 33.7% and 17.3%, respectively, while for NETs of unknown origin (second-largest non-GEP NET grouping), five- and ten-year overall survival rates are 38% and 22%, respectively.
NETs are characterized by over-expression of somatostatin receptors, which are protein receptors that sense molecules outside of the cell and activate cellular responses to somatostatin. Somatostatin is an important regulator of the endocrine system, and the over-expression of these receptors in NETs, particularly the SSTR2 receptor, creates a target for radioligand therapy to bind to and provide treatment.
NETs are difficult to diagnose because individuals often remain asymptomatic in the early stages of the cancer, and symptoms that are exhibited are not unique to NETs. According to some reports, over 50% of people with NETs have metastases at diagnosis, upon which NETs cannot be effectively treated with surgery alone and there is a need for alternative therapeutics to provide additional treatment.
NETs are characteristically insensitive to chemotherapeutic agents due to their slow proliferation. In generally small studies (n = 20-85 GEP-NET participants), combination chemotherapy using various anti-proliferative agents (e.g., fluorouracil, streptozotocin, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, interferon-alpha) has yielded typical response rates of less than 40%, duration of response as low as 3 – 8 months and median overall survival of 10 – 40 months.
There are a limited number of therapeutic approaches targeting somatostatin in NETs. Novartis’ Sandostatin®, which generated $1.2 billion in 2022 sales, is a somatostatin analogue that controls clinical syndromes associated with NETs but does not treat the metastatic NETs themselves. Ipsen S.A.’s Somatuline®, which generated €1.2 billion in 2022 sales, was approved in December 2014 for the treatment of adult with differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic GEP-NETs. Novartis’ Lutathera® is another radioligand therapy using 177Lu-DOTATATE that was approved in January 2018 for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive gastreoenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in adults. Lutathera® received an orphan drug designation from the FDA and is the first available FDA-approved peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Novartis reported sales of $471 million for Lutathera® in 2022. While these therapies have brought treatment options to people with GEP-NETs, the scope of the approved indications creates a significant need for a novel approach to treatments for people with non-GEP-NETs.
The options for people with non-GEP-NETs are more limited. Afinitor® (everolimus) is approved for lung NETs. If a lung NET is detected early enough it will be treated first with a somatostatin analogue ("SSA") and then a combination of SSA and Afinitor® upon progression. However, Afinitor® has a challenging side effect profile with 42% of participants with NETs in the pivotal trial experiencing serious adverse events, including death. Following treatment with SSA and Afinitor®, there is no clear treatment paradigm for lung NETs, leaving those individuals and their physicians choosing between clinical trials or chemotherapy. With lung NET cancers accounting for nearly 30% of all NETs, this represents a large unmet need.
POINT's Solution: 177Lu-PNT2003
177Lu-PNT2003, also known as 177Lu-octreotate ("177Lu-DOTATATE"), is a somatostatin-targeted radioligand therapy in development for the treatment of individuals with somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors, targeting both

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GEP-NETs and non-GEP-NETs. 177Lu-PNT2003 is the subject of a completed multi-center trial in Canada (OZM-067; NCT02743741) sponsored by UHN and designed to evaluate 177Lu-PNT2003's safety and efficacy across individuals with NETs who have positive somatostatin receptor expression identified by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET. 
POINT licensed worldwide rights to the clinical data and the intellectual property for the radioligand compound from CanProbe in December 2020. CanProbe’s intellectual property for 177Lu-PNT2003 covers methods of preparing, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment of various indications including neuroendocrine tumors. 
Although 177Lu-PNT2003 uses the same molecular entity as Novartis’ Lutathera®, 177Lu-PNT2003 uses a different type of 177Lu, called n.c.a. 177Lu. By using n.c.a. 177Lu, 177Lu-PNT2003 will not contain any metastable lutetium-177m ("177mLu"), an impurity introduced into Lutathera® via the production method of its carrier-added 177Lu. The introduction of the 177mLu impurity in Lutathera® is problematic for hospitals and clinics as 177mLu is a radionuclide with a half-life of 5+ months, which necessitates dedicated waste streams and other burdensome overhead for physicians and clinics. POINT believes 177Lu-PNT2003’s use of n.c.a. 177Lu will therefore provide a competitive advantage. 177Lu-PNT2003 could be further differentiated from Lutathera® in the indication it is targeting (non-GEP-NETs), which is not included in Lutathera’s current label and for which there are limited treatment options.
Clinical Development and Next Steps
177Lu-PNT2003 is currently the subject of a completed open-label, single-arm study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PNT2003 across individuals with NETs who have positive somatostatin receptor expression identified by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET. The interim data received from UHN in December 2020 included 167 participants across GEP-NETs as well as neuroendocrine tumors of other tissue origins including lung, thyroid, adrenal, ovary, kidney, pituitary, and unknown origin, collectively referred to as non-GEP-NETs. The breakdown of participants was 33 non-GEP-NET participants and 134 GEP-NET participants. The last patient last dose for OZM-067 occurred in July 2021, all participants completed the primary follow-up in the second quarter of 2022, and long term follow-up is still ongoing.
In November 2022, POINT announced strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreements with Lantheus for exclusive worldwide rights for 177Lu-PNT2003, excluding certain territories (Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, and China including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). For 177Lu-PNT2003, POINT has received a $10 million upfront payment, and will receive up to an additional $30 million upon U.S. regulatory approval, royalties of 15% on net sales, as well as the potential for up to an additional $275 million in various net sales milestone payments. Joint steering committees have been formed to oversee the clinical studies, regulatory filings, manufacturing, and commercial readiness for 177Lu-PNT2003. 
In late 2022, POINT received the OZM-067 clinical trial data sets from the trial sponsor. POINT will facilitate the analysis of the data sets. As per the strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreement, Lantheus will be responsible for all subsequent development of the asset post initial regulatory filings within the U.S., and for all development efforts in their territories.
PNT2004 Program
Background on Fibroblast Activation Protein-α and Fibroblast Activation Protein-α Inhibitors
An exciting development in cancer research has been the identification of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as a potential target for imaging and treatment of various pathological conditions including fibrosis, arthritis and cancer. Several tumors, including breast, colon, prostate and pancreatic, develop a dense fibrous tissue comprised of CAFs around and within the tumor. CAFs can contribute up to 90% of the tumor mass. The CAFs of malignant tumors express FAP, a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein with peptidase activity. FAP is unique in that it is expressed in over 90% of epithelial cancers, but generally is not present on healthy cells. Given that FAP is expressed in the majority of cancers and that FAP-positive CAFs are involved in tumor progression and supporting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, it is believed that targeting this protein is a potential strategy to effectively treat malignant tumors.
Initial imaging studies of 68Ga-FAP inhibitors (“FAPI”) PET/CT suggested that these tracers are suitable for diagnostic cancer solutions and radioligand therapies. It was determined that even lesions that were already unequivocally identified radiologically could be characterized in additional detail through FAPIs. A retrospective analysis reviewing the development of quinoline-based FAPIs, conducted by Kratochwil and published in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine in 2019, illustrated that the technology has promising clinical applications. The study concluded that several cancers, including lung, breast, esophagus, pancreatic, head-neck, and colorectal cancer, presented high uptake on FAPI. The over-expression of FAP in cancers which have limited treatment options and low five-year survival rates present a significant market opportunity in an area of unmet need.

POINT's Solution: PNT2004 Program
Most targeted radioligand therapies are designed to target a limited number of cancers by targeting a receptor that is present on tumor cells of a specific type of tissue, such as prostate, but absent in all other healthy tissues. As FAP is highly expressed on a wide range of solid tumors, a FAP-targeted radioligand offers the potential for a tissue agnostic opportunity that could enable the precise treatment of a variety of solid tumors independent of tissue origin. The PNT2004 program consists of a family of FAP-targeted radioligands invented by Dr. William Bachovchin at Tufts University. POINT licensed worldwide rights to this family of FAP-targeted radioligands from Bach Biosciences in April 2020.
A clinical candidate, 177Lu-PNT6555, was identified from a screen of FAP inhibitors for our PNT2004 program. The clinical candidate was characterized in preclinical studies using Fox Chase SCID mice bearing HEK-mFAP tumor xenografts. In studies with 177Lu, the compound was found to have a significant amount of the injected dose accumulate in xenograft tissue (~16% of the injected dose/gram at 4 hours, %ID/g), with normal tissues showing little accumulation. After 24 hours the amounts of 177Lu-labeled compound in healthy tissue were less than 2% ID/g, with ~24% ID/g accumulating in xenograft tissue, and after 7 days ~11% ID/g remained in xenograft tissue. In survival studies, mice bearing tumors of approximately 200 mm3 were dosed with the 177Lu-labeled compound (15 MBq, 30 MBq and 60 MBq) or control. Anti-tumor activity was found at all tested dose levels and the response was dose-dependent. Complete regressions occurred in 6 of 6 mice in the 60 MBq cohort and 3 of 6 in the 30 MBq cohort. Prolonged survival was found in all dose cohorts versus the controls, with 100% survival in the 30 MBq and 60 MBq dose cohorts surviving until day 80.

Clinical Development and Next Steps
The Company completed a pre-CTA meeting with Health Canada in December 2021 regarding the development pathway and clinical study design for the phase 1 trial. A CTA with Health Canada was filed at the end of the first quarter of 2022 for PNT6555, and a No Objection Letter was received from Health Canada in May 2022. The phase 1 clinical trial is called FRONTIER: “FAPi Radioligand OpeN-Label, phase 1 Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and DosImetry of [Lu-177]-PNT6555; A Dose Escalation Study for Treatment of Patients with Select Solid Tumors”. 
In April 2022, preclinical data for the program was presented in a poster at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2022 Annual Meeting. The poster was titled “Preclinical Characterization of the Novel Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)-Targeting Ligand PNT6555 for the Imaging and Therapy of Cancer” (Abstract ID: 3554, Session: Preclinical Radiotherapeutics). The presented data concluded:
•In preclinical xenograft models: 68Ga-PNT6555 is an effective imaging agent, with strong tumor targeting, low background in normal tissues and rapid clearance via urinary excretion, and 177Lu-PNT6555 shows prolonged tumor retention out to 168 hours post-injection.
•Efficacy studies with 177Lu-PNT6555 or 225Ac-PNT6555 demonstrate compelling and dose-responsive inhibition of HEK-mFAP tumor growth.
FRONTIER commenced in July 2022 in Canada using a 68Ga-based PNT6555 molecular imaging agent to select participants to receive a n.c.a. 177Lu-based PNT6555 therapeutic agent. FRONTIER's clinical protocol evaluates PNT6555 in ~30 participants in five FAP-avid cancer indications: colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma.
Dosing in the FRONTIER phase 1 trial started at 4 GBq, with each subsequent dose level increasing by 4 GBq, also allowing 2 GBq dose de-escalations. Each 177Lu PNT6555 dose is followed by a 6-week interval. 68Ga-PNT6555 PET/CT imaging is conducted approximately 90 minutes post injection, and dosimetry is assessed at the time of first 177Lu-PNT6555 dose and at each subsequent cycle. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended phase 2 dose.
In November, 2022, preclinical data supporting the combination of 177Lu-PNT6555 with immunotherapy was released via a press release. The preclinical study focused on assessing the potential of the lead candidate in the PNT2004 clinical program, 177Lu-PNT6555, in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The CT26-mFAP tumor model used expresses low levels of FAP, grows aggressively, and is insensitive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The study found that combination treatment with 177Lu-PNT6555 and anti-PD-1 resulted in a significant survival benefit, as compared to either treatment independently.
Enrollment in cohort 2 began in December 2022 and cohort 3 enrollment is expected to begin in the second quarter 2023. A total of six participants have been dosed with 177Lu-PNT6555 to date. We anticipate data from the full FRONTIER trial to be available in the first half of 2024.

PNT2001 — Next-generation PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy
Background
POINT estimates that there were 269,000 new cases of prostate cancer in 2022. Of these, approximately 4% will be newly diagnosed with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer ("mHSPC"), another 34% will progress with biochemically recurrent disease and finally another 26% will have their case misdiagnosed from traditional imaging methods. Therefore, POINT estimates that nearly 40,000 individuals diagnosed in 2022 will require lifelong ADT. These individuals often live 15 years or more on androgen deprivation therapy and suffer with erectile dysfunction, loss of bone density and bone fractures, loss of muscle mass and physical strength, weight gain, mood swings and fatigue. There is therefore an unmet need in this population to delay the need for lifelong androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.
PSMA is expressed in approximately 80% of prostate cancer tumors and is present at all stages of the disease. PSMA expression significantly increases in locally advanced cases, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases as compared to primary tumors. Given the expression of PSMA throughout all stages of the disease, there is potential for PSMA-targeting radioligands to help delay the need for ADT. Radioligand development programs that are in late-stage development, including 177Lu-PNT2002, may not be suitable for the treatment of mHSPC due to off-target accumulation in kidney which creates the potential for delayed renal toxicity which is more likely to manifest in this population given these individuals live for 15 years or more; therefore, there is an opportunity for next-generation PSMA-targeted radioligands with less off-target accumulation to fill this gap.
POINT's Solution: PNT2001 Program
PNT2001 is a next-generation PSMA radioligand family of drug candidates licensed from Scintomics GmbH which have an improved biodistribution profile compared to current-generation PSMA-targeted radioligands, such as 177Lu-PNT2002, and therefore has the potential to deliver increased efficacy and be used more broadly. As demonstrated in preclinical animal model studies, PNT2001 ligands have unique linker technology that enables increased tumor accumulation, potentially enabling lower doses of radioisotope to reduce off-target toxicity while allowing for the same level of tumor kill.
Preclinical studies have resulted in the identification of a lead candidate, 225Ac-PSMA-62, which, as compared to other late-stage PSMA-targeted radioligands, demonstrates potent anti-tumor activity using 225Ac, while also having an improved biodistribution profile. POINT has advanced 225Ac-PSMA-62 into IND-enabling studies with the aim of pursuing clinical development with 225Ac-PSMA-62 in the biochemically recurrent, oligometastatic, and post-177Lu-PSMA mCRPC settings.
Clinical Development and Next Steps
In October 2022, POINT published additional preclinical data for the PNT2001 program. The new data were shared at the 35th Annual Congress of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) in Barcelona, Spain in E-poster #039, titled “Development and characterization of a next-generation 225Ac-PMSA radioligand”. An IND/CTA submission for 225Ac-PSMA-62 is projected for the second quarter of 2023, with the first participant expected for 225Ac-PSMA-62's phase 1 clinical trial by the end of 2023.

CanSEEKTM
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Unlike POINT's other product candidates, CanSEEKTM is not a radioligand. It is a prodrug technology platform which can be applied to a wide variety of radioligands to refine their targeting precision. The goal of CanSEEKTM is to enable the creation of tumor-activated radioligand therapies, which have higher therapeutic indexes then their non-tumor-activated counterparts.
Background
One of the most commonly raised concerns about radiation therapy is that off-tissue delivery of radiation can damage otherwise healthy tissue. For example, with PSMA-targeted therapies, kidney and salivary gland uptake are of concern. These concerns are amplified when patient life expectancy is long, as the effects of radiation toxicity can take long periods of time to manifest. The risk of damaging healthy tissue may also increase as new higher energy radioisotopes like 225Ac are used, increasing the importance of off-target damage mitigation strategies.
POINT's solution: CanSEEKTM
Due to POINT's interest in introducing radioligand therapies earlier in the treatment setting with a wider variety of radioisotopes, the Company began investigating technologies that could be used to increase the therapeutic index of radioligands. These investigations lead to FAP-activated radioligands invented by Dr. William Bachovchin of Tufts University / Bach Biosciences, who had also previously invented a general FAP-activated prodrug technology to increase the therapeutic index of chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin. Dr. Bachovchin’s technology had been licensed to Avacta, a U.K.-based life sciences firm, who subsequently branded the technology as pre|CISIONTM. POINT’s CanSEEKTM technology is the subject of licenses from both Bach Biosciences and Avacta.
CanSEEKTM could decrease the risks associated with off-target delivery of radioligands by limiting their ability to bind to receptors on healthy cells. The way CanSEEKTM achieves this is by using the presence of fibroblast-activation proteins, which are expressed in over 90% of epithelial cancers but not expressed in healthy cells, as the switch to activate the radioligands. The following image visually explains how CanSEEKTM works:
CanSEEKTM is first conjugated with the radioligand, which effectively blocks the radioligand from binding to receptors. The presence of FAP in the tumor microenvironment enables tumor-specific activation of the radioligand. Once activated, the radioligand can once again bind to cancer cell receptors. If the radioligand does not enter the tumor microenvironment, the radioligand is eliminated from the body without accumulating in off-target tissues expressing the receptor.
Preclinical Data and Next Steps
POINT has not published substantial preclinical data from CanSEEKTM. Multiple (d)-Ala-Pro substrate enabled-ligands are currently being studied preclinically against different targets.
POINT's Radioligand Platform: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Pipeline Expansion
Although radioligand therapies have existed for over 50 years, very few radioligand therapies are available today. POINT's founders believe the primary reason for this is that radioligands have very little in common with other drug classes, making it more difficult for traditional pharmaceutical companies to develop them. 
19


TABLE OF CONTENTS

POINT was founded to capitalize on this opportunity, by building a new pharmaceutical company focused on the unique requirements of radioligand development and commercialization.
Isotope Supply
The first of these unique requirements is access to rare medical isotopes. POINT has built one of the industry’s most resilient medical isotope supply chains, which includes both external supply partners as well as internal isotope manufacturing capabilities expected to commence by the end of 2023.
Manufacturing
The second requirement is the ability and licensing to handle and manufacture radioactive drugs. POINT owns and operates an 80,000 square foot radioligand manufacturing facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. In April 2021, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a materials license for POINT's facility, and POINT began supplying doses to the SPLASH trial in January 2022. The location of the facility, near several high-volume transport hubs, such as FedEx’s hub for radioactive shipments, will enable our facility to service North America and the E.U., as well as many international destinations. POINT expects this facility will provide adequate production capacity to meet future commercial demands for their product candidates, if approved. POINT also relies, and expects to continue to relying, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute their investigational product candidates. 
The specifications of the Indianapolis facility were designed to meet the future needs of the Company, and give POINT a unique competitive position in the industry. These design decisions include:
•Scale: The facility is one of the largest radioligand production facilities in the world. The facility has been designed in a modular fashion which enables additional production lines to be enabled only when needed. The large scale of POINT's facility also is expected to enable the implementation of a level of automation not commonly found in the radioligand industry, with the intention overtime to lower costs of production while simultaneously increasing the throughput of production.
•Isotope agnostic: Although POINT's pipeline of product candidates primarily uses the 177Lu radioisotope, their facility is designed and licensed to support a wide variety of radioisotopes, include betas, gammas and alphas such as 225Ac. External supply of 225Ac has been secured through the U.S. Department of Energy Isotope Program (managed by the Office of Isotope R&D and Production), TerraPower, Ionetix, and NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes.
•Internal isotope production: In addition to manufacturing the finished radioligand product, POINT's facility is designed to support manufacturing of radioisotopes in-house, for example purifying n.c.a. 177Lu from irradiated Yb. For Lu production specifically, POINT has already executed a supply agreement for Yb and licensed technology for the purification of n.c.a. Lu, as well as secured access to neutrons from nuclear reactors. The ability to produce Their own n.c.a. 177Lu is expected to both lower the cost of goods sold of POINT drugs, and further increase the resilience of the Company's supply chain. With internal isotope manufacturing capabilities, POINT intends to use in-house manufactured 177Lu isotopes, as well as externally sourced 177Lu, to ensure supply redundancy and uninterrupted supply for the manufacture of their radioligand therapies. External supply of 177Lu has been secured through ITM Medical Isotopes and Isotopia.
Pipeline Expansion
The final requirement is the technical expertise to develop new radioligands. Developing new radioligands is technically difficult - for example, the radiation emitted by the radioisotope can destroy the ligand. POINT has assembled a team of radioligand experts with experience in the discovery and development of new radioligands to further expand POINT's pipeline of product candidates. POINT is currently focused on expanding its pipeline by identifying and assessing novel ligands and working with new radioisotopes, as well as investigating combinations with other drug classes such as immune-oncology, DNA damage response inhibitors and chemotherapies.
Commercialization
None of POINT’s product candidates have received the regulatory approvals required to begin commercialization. In November 2022, POINT announced strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreements for the commercialization of 177Lu-PNT2002 and 177Lu-PNT2003 with Lantheus. If marketing approvals are obtained, Lantheus will commercialize both 177Lu-PNT2002 and 177Lu-PNT2003. In preparation, POINT and Lantheus have formed a joint steering committee to oversee the commercial readiness for both 177Lu-PNT2002 and 177Lu-PNT2003.
20


TABLE OF CONTENTS

POINT intends to retain significant development and commercial rights to their other product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to either commercialize their investigational products on their own or with a partner. The decision as to whether to commercialize a product candidate independently or with a partner will depend on several factors, such as the clinical data, the competitive landscape and the size of the addressable patient population, as well as the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing requirements.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid advancement of novel technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While POINT believes that their technology and scientific expertise and manufacturing capabilities provide them with competitive advantages, their face potential competition from multiple sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and public and private research organizations.
Radioligands are being explored in several different settings, including both commercial and academic clinical trials. Results from these trials, combined with recent product approvals, have garnered continued interest in the space by both large pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, which are developing both early-stage and later-stage candidates.
Given the nature of POINT's product candidates, POINT considers our most direct competitors to be other companies focusing on beta-based radiopharmaceuticals, both in development and already approved. There are multiple companies, including Lantheus, Novartis AG, and Q BioMed Inc., with approved beta-based radiopharmaceutical products using isotopes such as 131I, 177Lu, Sr and Y. Novartis’ Lutathera® and Pluvicto® are prominent beta-based radioligands, and other beta-based radiopharmaceuticals are in various stages of clinical development by companies including Novartis AG, Curium SAS, Nordic Nanovector, Cellectar Biosciences, ITM Isotope Technologies Munich SE, Clovis Oncology and Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc., Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lantheus, Blue Earth Therapeutics, and Clarity Pharmaceuticals. 
There are also several companies developing alpha-based radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer, including Bayer AG, or Bayer, Novartis AG, or Novartis, Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., RadioMedix, Inc., Orano Med, Viewpoint Molecular Targeting, Aktis Oncology, Fusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., RayzeBio, Inc., Aktis Oncology, Inc., Convergent Therapeutics, Janssen, ARTBIO, and Curie Therapeutics, Inc. These companies use various alpha-emitting isotopes such as 223Ra, 225Ac, 212Pb and 227Th. Most alpha-based radiopharmaceuticals are in clinical development, with Bayer’s Xofigo® being the only approved alpha particle-based therapy. Xofigo® was approved in 2013 for the treatment of symptomatic bone metastases in people with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
For POINT's product candidates 177Lu-PNT2002 and 225Ac-PSMA-62 of the PNT2001 program, the Company is aware of several competing therapies targeting metastatic prostate cancer. POINT's closest approved competitor is Novartis’ Pluvicto®, which uses 177Lu for the treatment of late-stage metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and is currently approved for use in the U.S. and Europe. POINT is aware of the following companies with prostate cancer preclinical and clinical development programs: Janssen, CTT, Novartis, BlueEarth, Curium, Telix, and Lantheus. In addition, POINT expects to face indirect competition from established treatments of prostate cancer, including Jevtana® (Sanofi), Zytiga® & Erleada® (Johnson & Johnson), Xtandi® (Astellas Pharma and Pfizer), Lynparza® (AstraZeneca), docetaxel, and Xofigo® & Nubeqa® (Bayer). While POINT believes 177Lu-PNT2002 and 225Ac-PSMA-62 could have significant competitive advantages compared to established treatments for prostate cancer (such as being used at different stages of disease), the Company may still face competition from these more established treatments.
For POINT's product candidate 177Lu-PNT2003, the company is aware of several competing therapies targeting neuroendocrine tumors. Novartis’ Lutathera®, which was approved in 2018, uses 177Lu for the treatment of individuals with somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancers. The Company is aware of the following companies with neuroendocrine tumor, radioligand preclinical and clinical development programs: ITM, RayzeBio, Inc and Radiomedix. POINT also faces potential competition from other treatments targeting neuroendocrine tumors such as Sandostatin® and Afinitor® (Novartis), Somatuline® (Ipsen) and Sutent® (Pfizer). While POINT believes 177Lu-PNT2003 has significant advantages (such as its usage of n.c.a. 177Lu) compared to conventional approaches to neuroendocrine tumors, the Company may still face competition from these more established treatments.
For POINT's product candidates 68Ga-PNT6555 and 177Lu-PNT6555, of the PNT2004 program competitive threats include those candidates that are in development or currently approved for whatever indications that POINT's product candidates may be developed. FRONTIER's clinical protocol evaluates 177Lu-PNT6555 in ~30 participants in five FAP-avid cancer indications: colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. There are other early-stage radioligand programs targeting FAP, including Clovis Oncology, Novartis, Philogen Spa and SOFIE, which may directly 
21


TABLE OF CONTENTS

compete with POINT's candidate as either an imaging agent and/or therapeutic agent. However, given the early development stage of these product candidates, it is unclear whether they will be in direct competition with the product candidates from the PNT2004 program, 68Ga-PNT6555 and 177Lu-PNT6555.
CanSEEKTM, POINT's tumor microenvironment targeting prodrug platform, is too early-stage to identify direct competitors. While there are some companies such as Fusion Pharmaceuticals with early-stage technologies that hope to enhance the safety of actinium-based radioligands, the goals of our tumor microenvironment targeting prodrug platform extend beyond 225Ac-focused programs to increase the therapeutic index of radioligands regardless of the isotope used.
Many of the companies that POINT is competing against have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and marketing approved products than POINT does. Furthermore, the merger and acquisition or other strategic transactions involving these companies may result in resources being concentrated among a small number of POINT's competitors. If POINT's competition develops a product that is safer or more effective than theirs or brings a product to market faster than they can, POINT could see a negative impact on their commercial success. The key competitive factors affecting the success of the Company's product candidates, if approved, are their efficacy, safety, convenience for doctors and patients, price, competitive branded and generic products, and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual Property
POINT's intellectual property is critical to our business and our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and develop a robust intellectual property portfolio for our technology and product candidates, as well as on our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights. We generally seek to protect our product candidates and technology by seeking patent protection that would enhance clinical development and commercial success. We intend to continue relying upon patent protection, exclusivity pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities. 
As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio of owned and exclusively licensed patent filings included ten different patent families with pending and issued patents in the U.S. and other major markets, with several of the existing patent families still affording additional opportunities for worldwide filings. Our portfolio includes both in-licensed and internally developed intellectual property to protect our programs. Estimated expiry dates for our patent portfolio range from 2038 to 2043, with additional potential patent term adjustment and patent term extensions available in major markets and various other jurisdictions to extend the duration of patent protection. 
PNT2002 Program
POINT has a patent portfolio of (currently) 26 pending and issued patents covering 177Lu-PNT2002, which includes two issued U.S. Patents and filings in another 21 countries including in the major market countries of North and South America, Asia and Europe (in the form of an European Patent Office ("EPO") application which if granted can later be activated across Europe and the U.K.). Our issued U.S. Patents cover our proprietary method for manufacturing 177Lu-PNT2002 providing high purity and extended shelf life, as well as our proprietary formulations of 177Lu-PNT2002. We intend to pursue the same or similar claims in the other countries in which the patent application has been filed. This family of patent applications also disclose additional patentable subject matter including to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment and the process for production and formulation of 177Lu-PNT2002 to achieve such high purities and stability for up to five days. The patents from this family are expected to expire in July 2041, with any available patent term extensions (if applicable) added to that date. 
PNT2004 Program
POINT obtained an exclusive sublicense from Bach Biosciences, to the rights in a patent portfolio currently including 29 pending patent applications covering the PNT2004 family of FAPi-targeted radioligands. This portfolio includes several pending U.S. filings and filings in another 27 countries including in the major market countries of North and South America, Asia and Europe (in the form of an EPO application which if granted can later be activated across Europe and the U.K.). The licensed patent portfolio discloses and claims (as new chemical entities) small-molecule radioligand and imaging agents based on a FAP-specific inhibitor. The pending patent applications cover, in addition to the new compositions-of-matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods for diagnosing, imaging or treating/reducing tissue over-expressing FAP in an animals (including humans). The patents from this family are expected to expire in March 2041, with any available patent term extensions (if applicable) added to that date.

POINT obtained an exclusive license from CanProbe, Centre for Probe Development and Commercialization ("CPDC") and The University Health Network ("UHN") to the rights in a patent portfolio currently including 24 pending and issued patents covering 177Lu-PNT2003, which includes an issued U.S. Patent and filings in another 21 countries including in the major market countries of North and South America, Asia, Middle East and the E.U. (in the form of an EPO application which, if granted, can later be activated across Europe and the U.K.). Our issued U.S. Patent covers our proprietary formulation of 177Lu-PNT2003, which provides for a high purity and extended shelf life of the product. We intend to pursue the same or similar claims in the other countries in which the patent application has been filed. This family of applications includes additional support for patentable subject matter relating to the radioligand 177Lu-PNT2003 compound, including relating to methods of preparing the compound, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment of various indications including neuroendocrine tumors using 177Lu-PNT2003. The patents from this family are expected to expire in August 2041, with any available patent term extensions (if applicable) added to that date. 
PNT2001 Program
POINT obtained an exclusive license from Scintomics GmbH to a patent portfolio covering the new chemical entity underlying the PNT2001 program. This family of patents has nationalized and the license to POINT is for major markets including the U.S., Canada, the E.U. and Australia, as well as other countries. The patents cover, as new chemical entities, new amide-based radioligand compounds which bind PSMA and target PSMA-expressing tumor cells. In addition to the composition-of-matter claims, the compounds are disclosed and claimed for use in pharmaceutical or diagnostic compositions for diagnosing and/or treating cancer. The compounds may also be used for imaging and performing endoradiotherapy in diseases involving PSMA. The patents in this family will expire in December 2038, with any available patent term extensions (if applicable) added to that date.
CanSEEKTM Tumor Microenvironment-Targeting Technology Platform 
POINT obtained an exclusive sublicense from Bach Biosciences to a patent portfolio of 11 (currently) pending applications. The portfolio has been filed in major market jurisdictions including the U.S., Canada, Japan, China, South Korea, Israel and Europe (in the form of an EPO application which, if granted, can later be activated across Europe and the U.K.). The pending applications cover FAP-activated radiotheranostics that enable the delivery of radiodiagnostics and radiotherapeutics selectively to the tumor microenvironment for tumors expressing the FAP enzyme. This includes radiotherapeutics designed to target other molecules or receptors in the tumor microenvironment, such as PSMA. The pending patent application also discloses FAP-activated theranostic prodrugs, compositions comprising them, and a method of treating a disorder characterized by FAP up-regulation. The patents from this family are expected to expire in December 2041, with any available patent term extensions (if applicable) added to that date.
POINT also has a non-exclusive sublicense from Avacta to a patent portfolio directed to FAP-prodrugs generally (originally licensed from Bach Biosciences to Avacta) which includes pending patent applications in major markets, and issued patents in the U.S. That license, while a freedom-to-operate license for FAP-activated radioligands generally, does include a grant of an exclusive license to POINT for FAP-activated PSMA radioligands.

Business Combination
On June 30, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), POINT consummated a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination”) with Therapeutics Acquisition Corp., d/b/a Research Alliance Corp. I, a Delaware corporation (“RACA”), pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2021 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among RACA, Bodhi Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of RACA (“Merger Sub”), and POINT Biopharma Inc. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on the Closing Date, (i) Merger Sub merged with and into POINT Biopharma Inc. (the “Merger”), with POINT Biopharma Inc. as the surviving company in the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of RACA and (ii) RACA changed its name to “POINT Biopharma Global Inc.”
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), (i) each share and vested equity award of POINT Biopharma Inc. outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was exchanged for shares of the Common Stock or comparable vested equity awards that are exercisable for shares of Common Stock, as applicable, based on an implied POINT Biopharma Inc. vested equity value of $585 million (which results in a conversion ratio of approximately 3.59:1); (ii) all unvested equity awards of POINT Biopharma Inc. were exchanged for comparable unvested equity awards that are exercisable for shares of Common Stock, determined based on the same exchange ratio at which the vested equity awards were exchanged for shares of Common Stock; and (iii) each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of RACA (“Class A Common Stock”) and each share of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of RACA (“Class B Common Stock”) that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time became one share of Common Stock following the consummation of the Business Combination.
In addition, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on March 15, 2021, RACA entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and RACA agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of 16,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $165 million (the “PIPE Financing”). The PIPE Financing was consummated concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination. We received net proceeds of approximately $260.0 million consisting of proceeds of the PIPE

Financing and the proceeds remaining in RACA’s trust account. Transaction costs of approximately $27.0 million consisted of investment banker, legal, audit, tax, accounting, consulting, insurance, board retainer fees and listing fees.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing and any other product candidates we may develop. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes strict, joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites, including releases of radioactive materials, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination, the Low-level Radioactive Waste Policy Act ("LLRW Policy Act"), which requires the safe disposal of mildly radioactive materials that cannot be decayed in storage, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") regulations concerning various irradiated and radioactive, materials, and health regulations from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which limit exposures to hazardous substances, including radioactive materials, in the workplace and impose various worker safety requirements.
We, along with third-party contractors, are also required to comply with the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of the PNT2001, PNT2002, PNT2003, and PNT2004 programs, or CanSEEKTM or any future drug candidate. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and effectiveness must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
FDA Drug Development and Approval Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates and any future drug product candidates we may develop must be approved by the FDA through a new drug application (“NDA”), the vehicle through which drug sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for sale and marketing in the U.S. NDAs can be divided into the following four categories: 
1.A standalone NDA is an application submitted under section 505(b)(1) and approved under section 505(c) of the FDCA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness that were conducted by or for the applicant or for which the applicant has a right of reference or use. 
2.A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) and approved under section 505(c) of the FDCA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use.
3.An abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") is an application submitted and approved under section 505(j) of the FDCA for a drug product that is a duplicate of a previously approved drug product. An ANDA relies on FDA’s finding that the previously approved drug product, i.e., the reference listed drug (RLD) is safe and effective. An ANDA generally must contain information to show that the proposed generic product (1) is the same as the RLD with respect to the active ingredient(s), conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and labeling (with certain permissible differences) and (2) is bioequivalent to the RLD. An ANDA may 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

not be submitted if clinical investigations are necessary to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product. 
4.A petitioned ANDA is a type of ANDA for a drug product that differs from the RLD in its dosage form, route of administration, strength, or active ingredient (in a product with more than one active ingredient) and for which FDA has determined, in response to a petition submitted under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the FDCA (suitability petition), that studies are not necessary to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product. A petitioned ANDA is generally expected to provide the same therapeutic effect as the listed drug that was relied on as the basis of the suitability petition. 
There are other preliminary steps that must be conducted prior to the submission of a NDA. The FDA review and approval process for drugs generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices (“GLP”) requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for each proposed indication;
•preparation and submission of the NDA to the FDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials that includes substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness from results of nonclinical and clinical trials, and satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements;
•potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including (if deemed necessary by FDA) consideration of the views of any FDA Advisory Committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug for the intended indications in the U.S.
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies, Development and IND Submission
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of its preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators, who are generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP and regulations governing the protection of human research participants. All research participants must provide voluntary informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial.
Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, participant selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial participant or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The IRB is responsible for ensuring that human participants' rights and privacy are maintained. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (“DSMB”), which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the study. The DSMB may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for participants or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection (if deemed necessary).
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3. Trials and phases may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected individuals who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
•Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected individuals to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. For oncologic diseases with high unmet medical need phase 2 trials with primary endpoints considered a validated surrogate for clinical effectiveness may support accelerated approval. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger, confirmatory phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of disease-affected individuals at multiple sites and are designed to provide the statistically significant data necessary to demonstrate or confirm the effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use, to demonstrate or confirm its safety in use, to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of people in the intended therapeutic indication. In some cases, the FDA may require phase 4 clinical trials as a condition for approval of the NDA. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to humans.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
NDA Submission, Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA (unless a waiver or exemption applies).
Once a NDA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing (a 60-day process) or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
The FDA reviews a NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective and that any facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety and effectiveness. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing processes, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that, where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the complete response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the complete response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might undertake to resolve any findings and place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or effectiveness of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may include limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Even if approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, provided that the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. The review clock does not begin until the final section of the NDA is submitted.
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Post-marketing adequate and well-controlled studies would usually be already underway at the time of NDA approval. Among other reforms, the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”), part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022, expanded the FDA’s authority with regard the accelerated approval pathway for drugs and biologics. The statute requires the FDA to specify the conditions for any post-approval studies by the date of the accelerated approval (e.g., enrollment targets), and permits the FDA to require, as appropriate, that post-marketing confirmatory studies be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period following approval. Accelerated approval sponsors must submit periodic progress reports (every 180 days) on required post-approval trials and related conditions. The FDORA also outlines FDA procedures for withdrawing accelerated approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval on an expedited basis. As an additional condition of accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires the pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely affect the timing of the commercial launch of a product. The FDA is expected to issue several guidance documents regarding accelerated approval and post-approval studies by mid-2024.
Fast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. However, the orphan designation allows the sponsor to receive tax credits and a user fee waiver.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of people with the rare disease or condition.
Pediatric Information
Section 504 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 ("FDARA") amended section 505B of the FDCA to require—for original applications submitted on or after August 18, 2020—pediatric investigations of certain targeted cancer drugs with new active ingredients, based on molecular mechanism of action rather than clinical indication. Specifically, if an original NDA is for a new active ingredient, and the drug that is the subject of the application is intended for treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer, reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation must be submitted with the marketing application, unless FDA formally waives or defers the requirement after submission of an initial Pediatric Study Plan. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, addressing, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, product sampling and distribution, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, most modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, are subject to FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. Product approvals may also require post-marketing requirements ("PMRs"), which include studies and clinical trials that sponsors are required to conduct under one or more statutes or regulations, and/or post-marketing commitments ("PMCs"), which are studies or clinical trials that a sponsor has agreed to conduct but that are not required by a statute or regulation.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. Even with our facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, being operational, we may also rely on third parties for the production of clinical supply of our product candidates in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violations, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of post-approval problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, but are not limited to:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, mandated modification of promotional materials or the issuance of corrective information, issuance by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal by the FDA to permit the import or export of products; and
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulation
The pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations, including those related to healthcare fraud and abuse, privacy and security of health information and other personal data, transparency of financial relationships, registration of manufacturers and distributors, and marketing. These laws and regulations are broadly applicable, may vary across jurisdictions, and are administered by several different government agencies, including the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Further, these laws and regulations are subject to change, enforcement practices may evolve, and it is difficult to predict the impact of new laws and regulations. Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
Fraud and Abuse
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for items or services covered by a federal healthcare program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and have held that there is a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines, imprisonment, substantial civil monetary penalties, damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) as a false or fraudulent claim.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil FCA, govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit individuals and entities from making false claims or statements. The FCA may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a private individual, acting as a “whistleblower,” on behalf of the federal government. There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA, including knowingly, submitting a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government or submitting claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Parties can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not directly submit claims to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims. If a defendant is determined to have violated the FCA, they may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. Additionally, individuals or entities may be subject to criminal penalties under the criminal FCA.
Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed under other statutes that prohibit various forms of fraud and abuse. For example, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”), which requires a lower burden of proof than some other fraud and abuse laws, provides for penalties for a variety of healthcare fraud violations. These include, but are not limited 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

to, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary knowing that such action is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of items or services payable by federal healthcare programs, unless an exception applies. The CMP Law authorizes the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) to seek civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
Many states have similar fraud and abuse laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may impose additional liability for the types of acts prohibited by federal law. Some state laws apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
Privacy and Security
Privacy and security regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (“protected health information”), provide for individual privacy-related rights, require safeguards for protected health information and require notification of breaches of unsecure protected health information. Entities subject to HIPAA include health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and most healthcare providers. Entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities (known as business associates) are required to comply with certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations. Although we are not a covered entity or business associate, we are impacted by HIPAA indirectly. For example, HIPAA restricts the use and disclosure of protected health information for research, which may limit our ability to receive protected health information that is not redacted from covered entities and business associates. We may be required to agree to privacy and security terms as a condition of receiving data, and failure to comply with those terms could result in civil and criminal penalties.
There are several other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security of personal information. These laws vary, and noncompliance may result in penalties or other disincentives. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. In addition to civil penalties for violations, the laws provide for a private right of action for data breaches. Although information collected, used or disclosed in research, including clinical trials, and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the CCPA, our other personal information collection practices may be subject to the CCPA and similar state laws. Some other states also afford consumers expanded privacy protections, and several privacy bills have been proposed at both the federal and state level that may result in additional legal requirements that impact our business. Foreign laws, including for example the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, and may differ significantly from HIPAA.
The costs associated with developing and maintaining systems to comply with evolving data privacy and security laws, defending against privacy and security related claims or enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines can be substantial.
Sunshine Laws
The federal government and certain state governments have enacted laws, sometimes referred to as “sunshine laws” that aim to increase transparency in financial relationships between manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies and healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. These laws and implementing regulations generally require manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and to disclose ownership and investment interests held by healthcare professionals and their immediate family members. These reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, CMS collects data submitted by manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by federal healthcare programs and publishes the data on its public Open Payments website. In addition, some states have sunshine laws that are broader than the federal law by requiring the reporting of a larger set of payments or activities and including additional types of healthcare professionals or entities. Failure to comply with sunshine laws may result in sanctions, including civil monetary penalties.
Pharmaceutical Industry Compliance
Manufacturers and distributors of drug products are subject to state laws requiring registration with the state, which may extend to manufacturers and distributors that ship products into a state even if they do not have a place of business within the state. The federal government and some state governments also require manufacturers and distributors to 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

maintain records regarding the history of products in the chain of distribution. Federal law requires manufacturers to provide product tracing information to subsequent supply chain partners. The federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) governs the system of tracing certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the U.S., with the goal of protecting consumers from drugs that may be counterfeit, contaminated, stolen, or adulterated. This law requires manufacturers to, prior to or at the time of each transfer of ownership of a drug, provide the next owner with transaction history and other information and to only engage in transactions with authorized trading partners. In the event of a recall or an inquiry regarding a potentially illegitimate product, manufacturers must be able to provide information regarding the transaction history and other information about the products. Violations of the DSCSA may result in fines or imprisonment. Many states have similar laws and enforce recordkeeping and licensure requirements.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the HHS OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, which is guidance designed to help companies prevent fraud and abuse within federal healthcare programs, and other relevant government-issued compliance guidance. Several states require pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to publicly disclose sales information, marketing expenditures, drug pricing, clinical trials and other activities. Several states require pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, require registration of sales representatives, prohibit manufacturers from acquiring certain physician prescribing data for use in sales and marketing activities and prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, various federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws may also apply. Violation of laws governing the pharmaceutical industry may result in penalties such as criminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and additional reporting obligations and oversight.
Federal price reporting laws require many pharmaceutical manufacturers to calculate and report certain pricing metrics, such as average sales price (“ASP”) and best price, which may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and discounts on approved products. Penalties may apply if these metrics are not submitted timely and accurately.
Reimbursement and Pricing
Payment for healthcare items and services in the U.S. comes primarily from third-party payors, including government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors. Coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products can differ significantly between payors.
Sales of pharmaceutical products are materially affected by the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the product. A decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product may impact utilization. At the same time, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not mean that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Securing coverage and reimbursement for a product (often two separate processes) may involve conducting expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of a product, in addition to the studies required to obtain FDA or comparable regulatory approvals. Drugs administered under the supervision of a physician often have high price points, which may make obtaining adequate reimbursement from payors particularly difficult.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of both commercial payors and government healthcare programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices, examining medical necessity and reviewing cost-effectiveness of medical products and services as they seek to control costs. For example, payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication, or they may require substitution of generic products. Adoption of, or enhancement of existing, price controls and other cost-containment measures may limit revenue. Drug prices may also be reduced by discounts or rebates required by payors and future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from other countries.
The marketability of any drug candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may be negatively impacted if commercial payors and government healthcare programs do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. There is no guarantee that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our products or product candidates, even if the product candidates are FDA-approved. If adequate coverage and reimbursement is not available, we may not be able to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Government Reimbursement
We expect that reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid will eventually be a significant part of our revenues. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. Drug manufacturers must offer 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various government healthcare programs and may also be required to report specific prices to government agencies under these programs.
Medicare is a federal health insurance program for persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicare Part B generally covers medically necessary outpatient care, including physician services and a limited number of outpatient prescription drugs under limited conditions. Medicare Part B typically covers drugs that are not self-administered by a patient, including injectable and infused drugs and oral cancer drugs. Drugs that are not covered under Medicare Part B may be covered under Part D, an optional prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries that is administered by private companies.
Medicaid is a medical assistance program for eligible needy persons that is funded jointly by federal and state governments. Medicaid programs are operated by state agencies under plans approved by the federal government. Reimbursement methodologies, eligibility requirements and covered services vary from state to state. Although pharmacy coverage is an optional benefit under federal law, all states currently provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicaid are required to participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires them to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to certain safety net providers that serve vulnerable or underserved populations. Manufacturers participating in Medicaid are also required to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”), a program intended to help offset the federal and state costs of outpatient prescription drugs. Under this program, manufacturers agree to rebate a specified portion of the Medicaid payment for the drug to the states, and states share the rebates with the federal government based on their federal medical assistance percentage, which is the share of Medicaid spending in each state paid for by the federal government. When a manufacturer enters into an MDRP rebate agreement with HHS, Medicaid agrees to cover nearly all FDA-approved drugs from that manufacturer, effectively creating an open formulary. An MDRP rebate agreement is also required in order for payment to be made available under Medicare Part B for a manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs.
Drug Pricing Policies and Related Reforms
In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a large number of laws intended to result in significant changes to the healthcare industry, including proposals targeted at reducing the price of pharmaceutical products and limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act"), affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, and the establishment and expansion of value-based purchasing programs. The law also imposes price transparency requirements and established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which focuses on comparative clinical effectiveness research. In addition, the Affordable Care Act contains several provisions relevant to pharmaceutical manufacturers and that may impact our potential product candidates, including expansion of the 340B program, expansion of manufacturers’ rebate liability under the MDRP, and measures intended to reduce Medicare Part D enrollees’ out-of-pocket liability.
There is uncertainty regarding the ultimate effect of the Affordable Care Act, particularly as it has been, and continues to be, subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. However, President Biden has indicated that his administration intends to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid programs. There is also uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other reform efforts at the federal and state levels. For example, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, such as single-payor proposals (commonly referred to as “Medicare for All”) and changes to Medicare age requirements. These proposals could lead to increased coverage levels and utilization of services. However, the impact and timing of additional reform initiatives is unclear.
In recent years, there has been heightened governmental and public scrutiny over the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for their products. This has resulted in proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in August 2022, requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates if prices for certain drugs increase faster than the rate of inflation (beginning in 2023), caps annual out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries (effective in 2024), and allows the federal government to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers for a select number of high-cost drugs (prices to take effect beginning in 2026), among other drug pricing provisions. In February 2023, CMS announced that its Innovation Center will test new payment models intended to lower drug prices, including the Accelerating Clinical Evidence Model, which will focus on drugs that receive accelerated approval from the FDA, and the Cell & Gene Therapy Access Model, which will test a partnership approach between CMS, drug manufacturers, and state Medicaid agencies for administering outcomes-based agreements to help Medicaid beneficiaries access high-cost specialty drugs. In addition, HHS, the 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury issued a Transparency in Coverage final rule in 2020 that, for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, requires health plans to disclose on a public website the negotiated rates and historical net pricing for prescription drugs and to provide consumers with personalized cost-sharing information. The agencies also issued an interim final rule in November 2021, implementing certain reporting requirements imposed by the No Surprises Act, requiring health plans to disclose, among other things, information on the most frequently dispensed and costliest drugs, as well as prescription drug rebates paid by drug manufacturers to plans, issuers, third-party administrators and pharmacy benefit managers. CMS announced its intention to start enforcement of the transparency requirements beginning July 1, 2022. Beginning in 2023, the agencies will issue biennial public reports on prescription drug pricing trends and the impact of prescription drug costs on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. 
Some other efforts related to drug pricing reform involve importing drugs from other countries or using international pricing benchmarks. For example, in 2020, HHS and the FDA issued a final rule to allow FDA-authorized programs to import certain prescription drugs from Canada, although the rule excludes several types of prescription drugs such as radioactive drugs and biologics and imaging drugs. Some states, such as Florida, are pursuing their own initiative to import drugs for state health care programs.
In addition, HHS OIG issued a final rule in 2020 that amends the discount safe harbor of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to exclude rebates from drug manufacturers to Medicare Part D plan sponsors, adds a safe harbor to protect point-of-sale reductions from a drug manufacturer to a Part D or Medicaid managed care organization, and adds a safe harbor to protect certain drug manufacturer payments to pharmacy benefit managers. However, this rule was subject to legal challenges, and the Inflation Reduction Act prohibits implementation of the rule prior to January 1, 2032. 
The Biden administration and certain members of Congress have indicated their intent to continue to pursue drug pricing reforms. Proposals include allowing additional importation of prescription drugs from other countries and modifying the design of the Medicare Part D program. Some states also have passed legislation and issued regulations designed to lower prescription drug costs. These and other initiatives at the federal and state levels, if enacted and implemented, may directly or indirectly affect pricing of our product candidates.
Additionally, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, (the “Right to Try Act”) provides a federal framework for eligible patients to access certain investigational drugs that are the subject of an active IND application submitted to the FDA, but that have not been approved or licensed by the FDA for any use. The Right to Try Act allows patients to seek treatment without participating in a clinical trial and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA Expanded Access Program (i.e., compassionate use). Manufacturers are not obligated under the Right to Try Act to make products available to eligible patients Manufacturers and sponsors that provide an eligible investigational drug under the Right to Try Act must submit an annual summary to the FDA of the use of any drugs supplied under the statute. Most states have enacted similar laws.
The FDORA, which was enacted in December 2022, provides for several changes to the FDA’s regulatory framework, including changes to the accelerated approvals pathway and requirements intended to modernize clinical trials, including through diversity action plans. The legislation also created new programs, including an emerging technology program that is intended to support the adoption of innovative approaches to drug design and manufacturing.
Canadian Drug Development and Approval Process
In accordance with the Food and Drugs Act and associated Regulations, manufacturers of prescription drug products must receive authorization from Health Canada before prescription drug products may be marketed and sold. There is no assurance that Health Canada will issue an authorization for a product.
In order to obtain authorization, a manufacturer must file a regulatory submission with evidence of safety, efficacy and quality of the proposed drug product. While Health Canada’s review of the evidence and a manufacturer’s response to Health Canada’s inquiries can take as long as several years from the date that the manufacturer files its regulatory submission, it can often be completed within 1 year.
The typical regulatory process for prescription drug approval from pre-market to post-market in Canada, involves:
•preclinical studies, using for example, laboratory studies involving cell or tissue samples, or tests conducted on animals, to collect preliminary safety and efficacy data;
•clinical trials on humans, which require authorization by Health Canada to collect further safety and efficacy data;
TABLE OF CONTENTS

•a drug submission with Health Canada, including review by Health Canada that can take between one and two years;
•a market authorization decision by Health Canada and issuance of a notice of compliance (NOC) and drug identification number (DIN); and
