Vaccines and Anti-infectives
 
Marketed Products
 
BioThrax® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed). BioThrax is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for the general use prophylaxis, or GUP, of anthrax disease. In April 2014, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to BioThrax for the PEP indication. In November 2015, the FDA approved our supplemental Biologics License Application to expand the BioThrax label to include the post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, indication for BioThrax administered in combination with antimicrobial therapy. Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease caused by the spore forming bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax. Death due to inhalational anthrax infection often occurs within 24-36 hours of the onset of advanced respiratory complications. BioThrax is administered in a GUP setting by intramuscular injection in a three-dose primary series over an initial six-month period. The vaccine is protective after completion of this three-dose primary series. After the primary series, two additional doses are given one each at 12 and 18 months, with booster doses annually thereafter. BioThrax is administered in a PEP setting in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs following suspected or confirmed Bacillus anthracis exposure. The vaccination schedule for PEP consists of three doses of BioThrax administered subcutaneously at 0, 2, and 4 weeks post-exposure combined with antimicrobial therapy. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed final delivery of BioThrax doses under our previous 44.75 million dose procurement contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. In December 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC for the supply of up to approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax for delivery into the 
Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS, over a five-year period ending in September 2021. The potential value of this contract is approximately $911 million, if all procurement options are exercised. As of December 31, 2016, we have recognized revenue of approximately $15 million under this contract.
 
Also in December 2016, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, filed a Sole Source Notification to separately procure approximately $100 million of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS within 24 months from the date of contract award. It is our intent to negotiate and enter into this contract in the first half of 2017 with deliveries beginning thereafter.
 
In August 2016, the FDA licensed Building 55, our large-scale manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan, for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually on a single manufacturing train.
 
Product Candidates
 
NuThrax™ (anthrax vaccine adsorbed with CPG 7909 adjuvant). We are developing NuThrax, an anthrax vaccine product candidate based on BioThrax combined with CPG 7909, an adjuvant that we license from Pfizer Inc. We are developing NuThrax, in part with funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, and BARDA, to potentially elicit a more rapid onset of immune response using fewer doses than BioThrax while still providing protective immunity in patients. Using funds from our 2010 development contract with NIAID, in October 2014, we completed a Phase 2 safety, immunogenicity and dose ranging clinical trial of NuThrax in which all endpoints were successfully met, including requiring a fewer two-dose regimen than the BioThrax three-dose regimen and may shorten the recommended antibiotic (60-day) regimen for anthrax post-exposure prophylaxis. In September 2014, we also obtained additional funding for this product through a five-year development contract with NIAID of up to $29 million to support the development of a dry formulation of NuThrax, including: manufacturing, assay development and non-clinical activities through the preparation of an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA. The dry formulation of NuThrax is intended to increase stability of the vaccine candidate at ambient and higher temperatures, with the objective of eliminating the need for cold chain during shipping and storage. In March 2015, we signed a contract with BARDA valued at $31 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease. In September, 2016, we signed a contract with BARDA for up to approximately $1.6 billion, including a five-year base period of performance valued at approximately $200 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses following Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, pre-approval by the FDA. We anticipate that the FDA could grant EUA designation to NuThrax as early as 2018, triggering the initial two million dose delivery of NuThrax into the SNS in 2019. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of NuThrax into the SNS, valued from approximately $255 million to up to $1.4 billion, respectively, and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments valued at $48 million, which if both were to be exercised in full, could increase the total contract value to up to approximately $1.6 billion.
 
Within our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives business unit, we are leveraging our proprietary, broad-spectrum anti-viral and broad-spectrum antibiotic platforms to advance the development of potential dual-market molecules to address current and emerging public health threats, including the following investigational stage product candidates:
 
UV-4B. We are developing UV-4B, a novel anti-viral targeting host alpha-glucosidases as a potential oral treatment for dengue and influenza infections. This work is being conducted under a six-year, cost-plus fixed fee contract with NIAID that was awarded in 2011. These options include a base period and options supporting non-clinical influenza testing, reprotoxicity studies, manufacturing, and Phase 1 a/b and Phase 2a trials. Completed work to date has included successful production of GMP material, a successful Phase 1a trial completed in 2016 in which UV-4B demonstrated good safety and tolerability in humans, and studies which demonstrated UV-4B has worked against influenza in non-clinical proof of concept models. In February 2017, we initiated a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study, which is fully-funded under our development contract with NIAID, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of UV-4B as a potential oral treatment for dengue viral infection.UV-4B is part of a broader iminosugar small molecule series, which includes hundreds of novel compounds. We are currently conducting medicinal chemistry on this platform to explore and expand other novel uses for these analogues.
 
GC-072. We are developing GC-072, a member of the EV-035 family of novel bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors, belonging to the chemical class of 4-oxoquinolizine as a potential oral treatment for Burkholderia pseudomallei. This work is being conducted under a three-year contract with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA that was awarded in 2014. GC-072 has demonstrated protection in vivo from lethal B. pseudomallei infection when administered orally, and it shows activity not only on drug-sensitive strains, but also on clinical isolates resistant to marketed antibiotics (including quinolones). EV-035 molecules have also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against pathogens such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and H. influenzae, as well as several potential biodefense pathogens such as B. pseudomallei, B. anthracis, F. tularensis, and Y. pestis.
 
Antibody Therapeutics
 
Marketed Products
 
Anthrasil® [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. Anthrasil is comprised of purified human polyclonal immune globulin G, or IgG, containing polyclonal antibodies directed to the anthrax toxins of Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax disease, and is prepared using plasma collected from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with our BioThrax vaccine. Anthrasil was licensed by the FDA in March 2015 for the treatment of suspected or documented inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. Simultaneous with FDA approval in 2015, Anthrasil also received orphan drug designation, giving it market exclusivity in the United States until March 2022. To date, the principal customer for Anthrasil has been the U.S. government, specifically HHS. Anthrasil is procured by BARDA for delivery into the SNS. We have two contracts with BARDA. The first is a development and procurement contract that expires in April 2021. Our second contract with BARDA is a multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, as well as the manufacture of such plasma into bulk drug substance and finished drug product and delivery of finished product into the SNS over a five-year period through September 2018. BARDA issued one task order under this contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, which was completed in 2015. In addition to domestic government sales, Anthrasil has been sold to several foreign governments.
 
BAT® [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G)-(Equine)]. BAT is the only heptavalent antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for botulinum disease. BAT is comprised of purified polyclonal equine immune globulins (antibodies) directed to the seven toxins (A through G) produced by Clostridium botulinum. BAT was approved in the United States in March 2013 for the treatment of suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin A, B, C, D, E, F or G. It was also approved in Canada pursuant to Health Canada's Extraordinary Use New Drug, or EUND, regulations in December of 2016. Simultaneous with FDA approval in 2013, BAT also received Orphan Drug exclusive approval, giving it market exclusivity in the United States until March 2020. BAT is the only heptavalent botulism antitoxin available in the United States or Canada for treating naturally occurring botulism in adults or pediatric patients. Botulinum toxin is a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes botulism, a serious paralytic illness. Naturally occurring cases are mainly seen in infants or in adults who have consumed improperly processed foods. Botulinum toxin can also be used as a bioterrorism agent and has been identified in the United States as one of the highest priority bioterrorism threats. To date, the principal customer for BAT has been the U.S. government, specifically HHS. We are currently operating under a procurement contract with BARDA, which requires delivery of up to 200,000 doses of BAT into the SNS through May 2018. The total contract term is through May 2026, primarily to support stability testing. In addition to domestic government sales, BAT has been sold to several foreign governments.
 
VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. VIGIV is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA to address certain complications from smallpox vaccination. VIGIV is comprised of purified polyclonal human immune globulins (antibodies) directed to vaccinia virus, the virus that is used in ACAM2000, (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live), a product owned by Sanofi Pasteur Biologics, LLC, and which is currently being procured and delivered into the SNS. Vaccinia is not the virus that causes smallpox, but it is similar enough to elicit a protective immune response when used as a smallpox vaccine. Individuals who are susceptible to vaccinia may develop an infection from ACAM2000. These patients benefit from treatment with VIGIV. VIGIV was licensed by the FDA in May 2005 and by Health Canada in May 2007 for counteracting certain complications that can be associated with ACAM2000. To date, the principal customer for VIGIV has been the U.S. government, specifically HHS. We are currently operating under a procurement contract with the CDC, which requires us to maintain FDA licensure of VIGIV, as well as to collect plasma, manufacturing activities and product delivery of VIGIV into the SNS. The contract term is over a five-year period through August 2017, after which we anticipate negotiating a new contract or contract modification. In August 2016, the CDC exercised options for the manufacturing of plasma into final product and delivery of that product into the SNS, as well as continued stability testing and FDA licensure maintenance activities.

Research and Development
 
Our company is engaged in research and development and has incurred substantial expenses for these activities. These expenses generally include the cost of acquiring or inventing new technologies and products, as well as development work on new product candidates (or label expansions of existing marketed products). To offset these expenditures, we actively seek, and historically have been successful in obtaining, contract and grant awards for development funding from a variety of U.S. government sub-agencies within both HHS and DoD. Gross research and development expenses and net research and development expense (income) are as follows:

 | December 31, | 
----------------------------------------------+--------------+-------
in millions | 2016 | | | 2015 | | | 2014
Research and development expense | $ | 108.3 | | | $ | 119.2 | | $ | 104.7 | 
less: Contracts and grants | | (143.4 | ) | | | (117.4 | ) | | (91.7 | )
Net research and development expense (income) | $ | (35.1 | ) | | $ | 1.8 | | $ | 13.0 | 

Marketing and Sales
 
For our Vaccines and Anti-infectives, Antibody Therapeutics and Devices business units we market and sell our products primarily to the U.S. government and domestic non-government organizations. These business units share a small, specialized marketing and sales group comprised of Emergent employees. We intend to use a similar approach to the marketing and sales of other product candidates that we either successfully develop or acquire. In addition to domestic sales, we have established a marketing and sales capability targeting sales of our products to allied foreign governments as well as non-governmental organizations in foreign jurisdictions. For such non-U.S. sales we are using a combination of Emergent employees as well as third-party marketing distributors and representatives to identify potential opportunities to sell our products in key international markets, including Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Rim. We anticipate engaging additional representatives as interest in countermeasures addressing PHTs increases outside the U.S.
 
Our Contract Manufacturing business unit is supported by a dedicated group of business development professionals qualified to represent the full spectrum of contract product development and manufacturing services that we offer.
 
Competition
 
Our products and product candidates intended for the treatment or prevention of CBRN, explosive and EID threats face significant competition. Our products and any product or product candidate that we acquire or successfully develop and commercialize are likely to compete with currently marketed products and product candidates that are in development for the same indications. Specifically, the competition for our products and product candidates includes the following:

§ | BioThrax and NuThrax. Although BioThrax is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for the prevention of anthrax disease, we face potential future competition for the supply of anthrax vaccines to the U.S. government. PharmAthene, Inc., PaxVax Inc., Altimmune, Inc., Pfenex Inc., Soligenix, Inc., Immunovaccine Inc. and NanoBio Corporation are each currently developing anthrax vaccine product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Anthrasil. Although Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of toxemia resulting from inhalational anthrax, GlaxoSmithKline plc has obtained FDA licensure for ABthrax™ (raxibacumab), an anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic. Elusys Therapeutics, Inc. also has obtained FDA approval for Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) injection, indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax.

§ | BAT. Our botulinum immune globulin product is the only heptavalent therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of botulinum disease and has Orphan Drug Status. Other companies may be developing therapies aimed at treating or preventing botulism infections, however, direct competition is currently limited.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | VIGIV. Our VIGIV product is the only therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada to address adverse events from smallpox vaccination with ACAM2000. Other companies may be developing therapies aimed at treating or preventing vaccinia infections; however, direct competition is currently limited. SIGA Technologies, Inc. is developing Tecovirimat (Arestvyr™, ST-26), an oral therapy that targets orthopox viruses such as vaccinia and potentially smallpox.

Customer Reliance
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company's revenues from the United States comprised 96%, 98% and 96%, respectively, of total revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenues from HHS and HHS agencies comprised 83%, 86% and 83%, respectively, of total revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, product revenues from BioThrax comprised approximately 80%, 89% and 87%, respectively, of total product revenues.
 
Historically, we have derived substantially all of our product revenues from sales to the U.S. government, specifically HHS and DoD. We expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. In 2016, product revenues were $296.3 million, consisting of $285.8 million from sales to the U.S. and $10.5 million from international sales. In 2015, product revenues were $328.9 million, consisting of $320.0 million from sales to the U.S. and $8.9 million from international sales. In 2014, product revenues were $281.8 million, consisting of $267.4 million from sales to the U.S. and $14.4 million from international sales.
 
A second significant source of revenue for our company is our contracts and grants, which represents development funding primarily from the U.S. government, specifically HHS and DoD for our various investigational product candidates. We expect that this will continue to be a significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future. Contracts and grants revenue was $143.4 million in 2016, $117.4 million in 2015 and $91.7 million in 2014. These revenues substantially offset our costs in developing our product candidates.
 
A third and growing source of revenue for our company is from contract manufacturing. Contract manufacturing revenue was $49.1 million in 2016, $43.0 million in 2015 and $30.9 million in 2014.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
Our Lansing, Michigan site is a vertically-integrated manufacturing facility and the location of our BioThrax manufacturing operations. Located within the Lansing site is Building 55, our large-scale manufacturing facility, which was licensed by the FDA in August 2016 for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually on a single manufacturing train. The manufacturing capabilities of Building 55 are central to our Vaccines and Anti-infectives business unit. Our Lansing site also comprises biologics bulk product manufacturing capability (large- and small-scale), which we also seek to market to CMO customers.
 
Our manufacturing facilities located at our Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada site are actively engaged in plasma-derived hyperimmune therapeutics manufacturing, chromatography-based plasma fractionation, downstream processing, aseptic filling, packaging and warehousing, quality assurance and control, and include development laboratories and office space. At these facilities, we manufacture and fill our hyperimmune specialty plasma products, including BAT, VIGIV and Anthrasil, and we conduct bulk manufacture of RSDL lotion. Also at these facilities, we manufacture other marketed hyperimmune products for contract manufacturing customers. The facilities at this site will play a key role in executing both product development and manufacturing activities in support of our Antibody Therapeutics and Contract Manufacturing business units.
 
Our contract fill/finish services facility is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is referred to as our "Camden Site." The Camden Site provides pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validations, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies support. This facility is an approved manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and several countries in the European Union. The facility includes warehousing space used for cold-storage and freezer capacity to support contract manufacturing customers. Additionally, we intend for this facility to provide fill/finish services to many of our business units for our development and commercial stage products.
 
Our manufacturing facility focused on disposable manufacturing for viral and non-viral products is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our "Bayview Site." This facility was designed to take advantage of single-use bioreactor technology and is designed to be capable of manufacturing several different products, including products derived from cell culture or microbial systems. In June 2012, we entered into a contract with BARDA, which established our Bayview Site as a Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM. We envision this facility supporting future CIADM development and manufacturing activities for CBRN threat countermeasures, as well as our current and future non-CIADM product development and manufacturing needs. Additionally, and in support of the Contracting Manufacturing business unit, the capabilities of this facility have been and will continue to be marketed to non-U.S. government clients in need of bulk manufacturing services.
 
We also currently lease a packaging facility in Hattiesburg, Mississippi at the University of Southern Mississippi's Accelerator, a technology innovation and commercialization center. This facility is equipped to package RSDL. RSDL bulk lotion that is manufactured in Winnipeg is shipped to Hattiesburg, Mississippi for combination with RSDL sponges, which are further manufactured, packaged, and then released for sale. All RSDL packets are packaged at this facility.
 
Supplies and Raw Materials
 
We currently rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to manufacture some of the supplies we require for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as supplies and raw materials used in the production of our products. Typically we acquire these supplies and raw materials on a purchase order basis and, when possible, in quantities we believe adequate to meet our needs. We obtain Alhydrogel® adjuvant 2%, used to manufacture BioThrax and NuThrax, from a single-source supplier for which we have no alternative source of supply. However, we maintain stored supplies of this adjuvant sufficient to meet our expected manufacturing needs for these products. We also utilize a single-source supplier for the following other raw materials for our other products: the sponge applicator device and the active ingredient used to make RSDL and limited-source suppliers for various types of hyperimmune specialty plasmas used to manufacture our hyperimmune specialty plasma products, such as BAT, Anthrasil and VIGIV.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property that arises from our activities. It is our policy to respect the intellectual property rights of others. In general and where practicable, we pursue patent protection for new and innovative processes and products that we develop. The term of protection for various patents associated with and expected to be associated with our marketed products and product candidates extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect the intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. We take a number of measures to protect our trade secrets and confidential information, including entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties. In general and where practicable, we also pursue registered trademarks for our product candidates and marketed products. We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. We enter into these agreements to augment our own intellectual property and to secure freedom to operate where necessary. These agreements impose various commercial diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of agreements in the future.
REGULATION
 
Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
 
Government Contracting
 
Our status as a U.S. government contractor means that we are subject to various statutes and regulations, including:
 
 
§ | the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, and agency-specific regulations supplemental to FAR, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, or DFARs, and agency-specific regulations supplemental to DFARs, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of DoD government contracts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | export and import control laws and regulations, including but not limited to ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



U.S. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. These regulations can impose stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various regulations, our government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience, detailed auditing and accounting systems requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions, and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes.
 
Project BioShield. The Project BioShield Act of 2004, or Project BioShield, provides expedited procedures for bioterrorism-related procurement and the awarding of research grants, making it easier for HHS to rapidly commit funds to countermeasure projects. Project BioShield relaxes procedures under the FAR for procuring property or services used in performing, administering or supporting biomedical countermeasure research and development. In addition, if the Secretary of HHS deems that there is a pressing need, Project BioShield authorizes the Secretary to use an expedited award process, rather than the normal peer review process, for grants, contracts and cooperative agreements related to biomedical countermeasure research and development activity. Under Project BioShield, in limited specified circumstances, HHS can contract to purchase unapproved countermeasures for the SNS and authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA.
 
First Responders Act. The First Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act of 2016 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to establish a pilot program to provide short-dated vaccines from the SNS to emergency response providers on a voluntary basis.
Product Development for Therapeutics
 
Pre-Clinical Testing. Before beginning testing of any compounds in human subjects in the United States, stringent government requirements for pre-clinical data must be satisfied. Pre-clinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. We perform pre-clinical testing on all of our product candidates before we initiate any human trials.
 
Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available clinical data or literature, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND. The sponsor must also include an initial protocol detailing the first phase of the proposed clinical investigation. The pre-clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified physician (also called an investigator) pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
 
§ | Phase 1 clinical trials test for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early evidence regarding efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 2 clinical trials involve a small number of patients with the target disease or disorder and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific indications to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 3 clinical trials consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product candidate using a specific dosing regimen. The safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 3 clinical trials typically form the basis for FDA approval of the product candidate.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 4 clinical trials are sometimes conducted after a product has been approved. These trials can be conducted for a number of purposes, including to collect long-term safety information or to collect additional data about a specific patient population. As part of a product approval, the FDA may require that certain Phase 4 studies, which are sometimes called post-marketing commitment studies, be conducted post-approval.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good Clinical Practice. All of the phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA's bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected.
Animal Rule. For product candidates that are intended to treat or prevent infection from rare life-threatening diseases, conducting controlled clinical trials with human patients to determine efficacy may be unethical or unfeasible. Under regulations issued by the FDA in 2002, often referred to as "the Animal Rule," under some circumstances, approval of such product candidates can be based on clinical data from trials in healthy subjects that demonstrate adequate safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from adequate and well-controlled animal studies. Among other requirements, the animal studies must establish that the drug or biological product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans. Because the FDA must agree that data derived from animal studies may be extrapolated to establish safety and efficacy in humans, these studies add complexity and uncertainty to the testing and approval process. In addition, products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements, including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients.
Marketing Approval – Biologics and Drugs
 
Biologics License Application/New Drug Application. All data obtained from a comprehensive development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. For small molecule drugs, this information is submitted in a filing called a New Drug Application, or NDA. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. Once an application is accepted for filing, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, requires the FDA to review the application within 10 months of its 60-day filing date, although in practice, longer review times may occur.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, BLAs, NDAs and certain supplements must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
In reviewing a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant approval, deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval or again request additional information. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes many years, involving the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The speed with which approval is granted often depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval. For example, it may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product. This can include various required elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug's risks and/or restrictions on distribution and use such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug. The FDA may also significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a product.
 
Fast Track Designation. The FDA may designate a product as a fast track drug if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this disease or condition. Sponsors granted a fast track designation for a drug are granted more opportunities to interact with the FDA during the approval process and are eligible for FDA review of the application on a rolling basis, before the application has been completed. The FDA granted fast track status to NuThrax in June 2011.
Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an ''orphan drug'' in the United States if the drug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, reduced filing fees for marketing applications and a special seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval. Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another applicant if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public's need. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved.
 
Our products with current Orphan Drug exclusivity include the following:
 
 
§ | BioThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of disease following suspected or confirmed B. anthracis exposure, when administered in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs, with exclusivity though November 2022;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Anthrasil for the treatment of toxemia associated with inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs, with exclusivity through 2022; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | BAT with exclusivity through March 2020 for treatment of suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin A, B, C, D, E, F or G.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Post-Approval Requirements. Any drug, biologic or medical device product for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product's distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA has post-approval authority to require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes if warranted by the appearance of new safety information. In certain circumstances, the FDA may impose a REMS after a product has been approved. Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their facility with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The FDA also closely monitors advertising and promotional materials we may disseminate for our products for compliance with restrictions on off-label promotion and other laws. We may not promote our products for conditions of use that are not included in the approved package inserts for our products. Certain additional restrictions on advertising and promotion exist for products that have so-called "black box warnings" in their approved package inserts, such as Anthrasil and VIGIV in the U.S.
 
Vaccine and Immune Globulin Product Lot Release and FDA Review. Because the manufacturing process for biological products is very complex, the FDA requires for many biologics, including most vaccines and immune globulin products, that each product lot undergo thorough testing for purity, potency, identity and sterility. Before a lot of BioThrax, Anthrasil or VIGIV can be used, we must submit a sample of the vaccine lot and/or a lot release protocol to the FDA. The lot release protocol documents reflect the results of our tests for potency, safety, sterility, any additional assays mandated by our BLA for BioThrax, Anthrasil and VIGIV and a summary of relevant manufacturing details. The FDA reviews the manufacturing and testing information provided in the lot release protocol and may elect to perform confirmatory testing on lot samples that we submit. We cannot distribute a lot of BioThrax, Anthrasil or VIGIV until the FDA releases it. The length of the FDA review process depends on a number of factors, including reviewer questions, license supplement approval, reviewer availability and whether our internal testing of product samples is completed before or concurrently with FDA testing. Health Canada has similar lot release requirements for immune globulin products.  Before a lot of BAT or VIG can be used, we must submit samples of the products and a lot release protocol to Health Canada. The length of the  Health Canada review process depends on a number of factors, including reviewer questions, license supplement approval, reviewer availability and whether our internal testing of product samples is completed before or concurrently with Health Canada testing.
 
Priority Review Vouchers. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act added Section 524 to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and established the Neglected Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher, or PRV, program. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established a PRV program within the FDA for medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats, and those vaccines, therapeutics and other medical countermeasures, or MCM, that prevent or treat material threat agents as identified in the Public Health Service Act. Recipients of a PRV may transfer that voucher to another party for consideration. We believe that UV-4B, an antiviral therapeutic being developed as an oral treatment for dengue viral infection, and ZIKA-IG (NP024), a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed as a prophylaxis and treatment for Zika infection, may each have the potential for a PRV under the Neglected Tropical Disease PRV program. We believe that GC-072, the lead compound in the EV-035 series of broad-spectrum antibiotics being developed as an oral and intravenous treatment for Burkholderia pseudomallei infection, may have potential for a PRV under the MCM PRV program. We believe that FILOV (NP026), an equine polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed to treat hemorrhagic fever caused by Filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg and Sudan), may have potential for a PRV under either the Neglected Tropical Disease PRV program or the MCM PRV program.
 
Marketing Approval – Devices
 
Devices may fall within the definition of a Medical Device or 
may be a Combination Product including both a device for delivery of 
a drug product and the drug product itself. Medical Devices are also subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive regulation under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. The classification of a device generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. RSDL is regulated as a Class II medical device.  Our auto-injector has not been cleared by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, is not promoted or distributed in the U.S., and is only sold to non-U.S. authorized government buyers.

§ | Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to a set of general controls. These general controls include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which sets forth requirements for manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse medical events, labeling and promotion only for cleared or approved intended uses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Class II devices are also subject to these general controls and to any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is typically accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. When 510(k) clearance is sought, a sponsor must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device approved by the FDA after May 28, 1976. This previously-cleared device is called the predicate device. If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, then 510(k) clearance to market will be granted. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. If a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device that was cleared prior to May 28, 1976, the proposed device is cleared based on a pre-amendment and is cleared as an unclassified device.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | A Class III device requires approval of a pre-market application, or PMA, which is an expensive, lengthy and uncertain process requiring many years to complete. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA. These trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE. An IDE must be supported by pre-clinical data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, which show that the device is safe to test in humans and that the study protocols are scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reports of adverse events, labeling and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use. If the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions, including:
 
 
§ | fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;
--+-----------------------------------------


§ | recall or seizure of products;
--+-------------------------------


§ | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | refusal of requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------



The FDA also has the authority to require repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device. The FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA approval are subject to FDA export requirements.
 
Combination Products, of the type described above, are subject to the BLA/NDA regulatory regime.  Our auto-injector is a combination product and has not been approved by the FDA or any other regulatory agency, is not promoted or distributed in the U.S., and is only sold to non-U.S. authorized government buyers.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the United States and Canada as well as select foreign countries. In the future, we may further expand our commercial presence to additional foreign countries and territories. In the European Union, medicinal products are authorized following a process similarly demanding as the process required in the United States. Medicinal products must be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the EU Member States or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the United States (e.g., good manufacturing practices). Additionally, each foreign country subjects such medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the European Union, a harmonized medical device directive legislates approval requirements. Within this framework, the CE Mark, an attestation of conformity with the essential health, safety and environmental requirements and compliance with relevant European Union legislation, allows for the legal marketing of the product in all European Economic Area member states.
 
Anti-Corruption Laws
 
As part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs are required to publicly report payments and transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. This information is posted on a public website. Failure to timely and accurately submit required information could subject us to civil penalties.
 
Our operations are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by the activities of our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector, Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries.
 
Other Regulation
 
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the use of data, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our activities.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of February 17, 2017, we had 1,098 full-time employees. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
