Overview
 
We are a developer of clean energy technologies. Our current focus is on developing an electrolyzer technology to lower the cost of Green Hydrogen production.
 
Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant fuel in the universe. It is a zero-emission fuel and only produces water vapor when used. However, hydrogen does not exist in its pure form on Earth so it must be extracted. For centuries, scientists have known how to use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using a device called an electrolyzer. Electrolyzers installed behind a solar farm or wind farm can use renewable electricity to split water, thereby producing Green Hydrogen. However, modern electrolyzers still cost too much. The chemical catalysts that enable the water-splitting reactions are currently made from platinum and iridium – both of which are very expensive precious metals. These catalysts account for nearly 50% of the cost of the electrolyzer.
 
We are developing technologies to significantly reduce or replace rare earth materials with inexpensive earth abundant materials in electrolyzers to help usher in a Green Hydrogen economy. In a 2020 report, Goldman Sachs estimates that Green Hydrogen will be a $12 trillion market opportunity by 2050.
 
We are also developing innovative technologies to increase the storage capacity, lower the cost and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (EV). We have previously developed an innovative material technology to reduce the cost per watt of electricity produced by Photovoltaic, or PV, solar modules. We are currently working on a silicon anode material technology intended to reduce the cost of current and future generation of lithium-ion batteries for EVs. 
 Industry Overview
 
Hydrogen is the most abundant and prevalent clean energy in the universe. 73% of the Sun is made up of hydrogen.
 

● | On a weight basis, hydrogen (142 MJ/kg) contains 3X as much energy as gasoline (46 MJ/kg), and 200X as much energy as lithium-ion batteries (0.6 MJ/kg).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It can be used in fuel cells to power electric vehicles or cities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It can be combusted in gas turbines or internal combustion engines for power generation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It is a zero-emission clean fuel and produces only water vapor when used.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It is the main ingredient in fertilizers that feed our hungry world.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Hydrogen doesn’t exist in its pure form, so it must be extracted. According to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 98% of hydrogen in the world is made by steam reforming of natural gas (“Grey Hydrogen”) or coal gasification (“Brown Hydrogen”). Both sources of hydrogen are basically different forms of dirty, carbon heavy, and non-renewable fossil fuels. This does little to help fight climate change or lead to renewable energy and a sustainable planet.
 
According to a 2020 research report from Grand View Research, hydrogen is already a big business with an annual market size of more than $117 billion in 2019. Developing cost-competitive Green Hydrogen made from renewable resources such as solar, wind and water can significantly expand the market for hydrogen. At this time, electrolyzer technology represents the most certain way forward.
 
Solar or Wind Energy + Water + Electrolyzers = Green Hydrogen
 
Abundant sources of Green Hydrogen can then power a clean energy world of fast charging fuel cell electric vehicles, light up our homes, make our fertilizers and ultimately replace many forms of fossil fuels.
 
An overwhelming amount of scientific evidence shows that carbon emissions from fossil fuels have contributed to increasing global climate change. Policymakers around the world have accelerated programs to enable the development and adoption of renewable energy. The U.S has been slow to adopt such programs but is quickly becoming a formidable force. According to the World Resources Institute, more than 14 U.S. states have legislative mandates requiring 100% renewable electricity, some as early as 2040. Both the U.K. and European Union are targeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

With this global backdrop and concerted actions toward climate policies and clean energy, we believe the Green Hydrogen revolution is ready to take off. The Sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. Therefore, green energy from solar and wind power is inherently intermittent and unreliable as a primary source of power. However, by converting that green electricity into Green Hydrogen, and it can be used anywhere and anytime for electricity, chemicals, heating and all necessities of life.
 
Because of the versatility of hydrogen, Green Hydrogen has the potential to fundamentally improve the world economy and usher in a new era of economic prosperity, sustainability, and energy independence to those with access to solar, wind and water… which describes most of the entire world.
 
In a 2020 report, Bank of America said that hydrogen will take 25% of all oil demand by 2050 and that the Green Hydrogen economy could be worth more than $11 trillion by 2050. The firm also compared the opportunity for Green Hydrogen to pre-2007 smartphones and the Internet prior to the dot-com boom.
 
Electrolyzer Technology 
 
For more than 200 years, scientists have known how to split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). By simply placing two metal electrodes into a jar of salted water (electrolytic solution) and applying an electrical voltage between them, H2 and O2 will bubble up at the separate electrodes. This process is called electrolysis and the device is called an electrolyzer. If the source of electricity is renewable such as solar or wind, then the resulting hydrogen is a zero-greenhouse gas renewable resource – Green Hydrogen.
 
There are two primary types of commercial electrolyzers. The original alkaline electrolyzer and the modern proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. However, neither technology can currently produce Green Hydrogen at scale that is cost competitive with Grey or Brown Hydrogen sourced from fossil fuels.
 
PEM electrolysis has the advantage of higher efficiency and quickly reacting to fluctuating input energy, which is ideally matched to the fluctuating nature of solar and wind energy. Its smaller footprint also makes it ideal for distributed systems, which is how most renewable energy systems are implemented.
 
PEM electrolyzers are expensive because they rely on rare earth materials such as platinum and iridium – literally stardust found only in asteroids – as chemical catalysts for the water-splitting reactions. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), these materials account for nearly 50% of the capital cost of PEM electrolyzers. Additionally, the cost of electricity contributes to over 50% of hydrogen production costs.
 
Our technology is aimed at lowering the cost of catalysts and key components in PEM electrolyzers by:
 

● | Replacing rare earth materials with inexpensive earth abundant materials,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Significantly reducing the amount of rare earth materials used, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reducing energy consumption

Applications of Green Hydrogen
 
Unlike lithium-ion where it is simply a battery technology, Green Hydrogen is an economy. There are many applications for Green Hydrogen, some with larger markets than others. Here are just a few.
(Source: U.S. DOE)
 

● | Green Electric Grid - The electric grid is finicky, sometimes it needs a lot of electricity sometimes it doesn’t. Unused electricity from solar and wind farms are wasted if it is not used immediately. The Sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow, and this makes solar and wind sourced electricity unreliable. One solution is to use an electrolyzer system to convert the excess solar/wind electricity into hydrogen and store it in inexpensive nearby underground caverns. When electricity demand spikes, the hydrogen can be converted back into electricity through a fuel cell. This is a very scalable solution as opposed to miles and miles of very expensive grid-scale battery systems. In fact, the Advanced Clean Energy Storage project in Utah aims to do just this by building the world’s largest storage facility for 1,000 megawatts of clean power, partly by putting hydrogen into underground salt caverns.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) - Perhaps the most exciting application of hydrogen is the direct use in fuel cell electric vehicles. A hydrogen tank in a passenger car can be filled in under 5 minutes. The only tailpipe emission is water. Big name car manufacturers such as Toyota, Hyundai, BMW, Mercedes-Benz all have FCEVs in development. China is committing to putting 1,000,000 FCEVs on the road by 2030.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) - BEV and FCEV can coexist just like diesel and gasoline cars coexist today. Battery EVs running on electricity generated through the Green Electric Grid is a beneficiary and indirect user of hydrogen technology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hydrogen Fueling Stations - Electrolyzers are well suited and scalable for distributed onsite Green Hydrogen generation in fueling station applications. With green electricity from a nearby solar array or renewable electric grid, Green Hydrogen can be produced anywhere and anytime. This distributed model of hydrogen production eliminates the need for expensive transportation from a centralized facility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower Carbon Gas Infrastructure - Green Hydrogen can serve as a steppingstone to a lower carbon footprint natural gas supply. Southern California Gas, and others, have demonstrated that the existing natural gas pipelines that supply gas to our cooking stoves and homes can safely contain 5-10% hydrogen without any modifications. This means that an electrolyzer system near a natural gas plant can inject Green Hydrogen directly into the existing gas infrastructure, lowering the carbon footprint of our meals and our warm homes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Air Taxis of the Future - Hydrogen has 200 times the theoretical energy of lithium-ion batteries per kilogram. In the emerging but potentially revolutionary air mobility market, small electric aircrafts, such as the Skai air tax drone, hydrogen is the obvious choice because weight matters. According to Skai, battery-powered air mobility vehicles are projected to have flight durations of less than half an hour before needing to recharge – Skai’s hydrogen fuel cells give them the ability to fly continuously for up to 4 hours or more with higher capacity auxiliary tanks.

Research and Development
 
Our electrolyzer technology research and development is conducted at the University of California at Los Angeles through a sponsored research agreement. The current program is focused on replacing iridium with earth abundant materials that meet or exceed the performance characteristics of iridium. We have also identified additional components and materials in electrolyzers where meaningful cost reductions can be performed. While iridium is the oxygen catalyst, its counterpart on the hydrogen side is platinum, a material so rare that only 200 tons are mined every year. Another critical component is the porous transport layer (“PTL”), aka gas diffusion layer, which facilitates the movement of water and gases to and from the catalyst surfaces. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the catalysts, membrane and PTL assembly account for more than 50%-75% of the capital cost of the electrolyzer stack.
 
In parallel to our Green Hydrogen technology program described above, we are developing a new material processing technology to produce Silicon Oxide Composite anode material. Silicon Oxide Composite anode has recently received significant interest because of its superior cycle and calendar life performance. We anticipate that a new processing technology can be developed to produce a type of Silicon Oxide Composite anode material that will significantly lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries for EVs.
