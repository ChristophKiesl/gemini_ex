MARKETS
 
Over the past 30 years, obesity in the United States (“US”) has risen dramatically. In 2013, the American Medical Association officially declared obesity a disease and new treatment guidelines were jointly issued from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Obesity Society recommending obesity be managed as a chronic disease. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1.9 billion people are overweight worldwide. In the United States, over two-thirds of the adult population fall within the overweight or obese categories and almost 38% (over 78 million) are obese.
 
Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (“BMI”) of 30 kg/m2 or greater, whereas overweight is defined as a BMI ranging between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. In 2015, all US states had an obesity rate of at least 20%. Only six states had an obesity rate that was less than 25%; twenty-five states had an adult obesity rate of 30% or higher. Being overweight and/or obese is linked to a multitude of serious comorbidities including heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression. In fact, the 2016 State of Obesity Report by Trust for America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated 80% of people with diabetes are overweight or obese.
 
The primary factors contributing to obesity, are well known: unhealthy food choices, excessive caloric intake, and lack of physical activity. Obesity is not limited to adults, children and adolescents are also affected. According to the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), in the past 30 years the prevalence of obesity in children age 6-11 years has doubled and obesity rates have quadrupled in adolescents age 12-19 years. Approximately 18% of children and 21% of adolescents are obese and are at an increased risk of developing health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and prediabetes.
 
The US spends an estimated $190 billion on obesity-related medical conditions; the average annual medical costs for those who are obese are over $1,400 higher than those of people in a normal weight range. The U.S. weight loss market itself is estimated to be a $65 billion per year industry, including consumer spending on diet foods, drinks and low-calorie sweeteners; health clubs and workout videos; medically supervised and commercial weight loss programs; children’s weight loss camps; diet books; appetite suppressants and more. Portion-controlled, meal-replacement weight management programs are continuing to gain popularity, as consumers search for a safe and effective solution that provides balanced nutrition, effective weight loss, and valuable behavior-modification education.

DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS UNITS
 
Take Shape For Life® – Take Shape For Life® is the personal coaching division of Medifast. This coaching network consists of health coaches (“Health Coaches”), who are independent contractors and trained to provide coaching and support to clients utilizing the Take Shape For Life® platform. The role of the Health Coach is to provide support and personal encouragement to help clients effectively reach and sustain a healthy weight, and adopt habits for a lifetime of health. Within our Trilogy of Optimal Health, the Company offers individuals an opportunity to create sustainable health in all areas of their lives – building a healthy body, developing a healthy mind, and generating healthy finances. Health Coaches and their clients follow the principles of the Discover Your Optimal Health book, Habits of Health book, and Habits of Health companion workbook written by the NY Times Best-Selling author and Take Shape For Life® co-founder to create an overall health optimization program. In addition to the encouragement and support of a Health Coach, clients of Take Shape For Life® are offered online product and program information, tools and support, and access to our registered dieticians. Clients of our Health Coaches order our products through either the Company’s or their Health Coach’s replicated website or our in-house call center. In addition to the full line of products and programs currently offered, Take Shape For Life® also introduced an exclusive product line under the lifestyle brand OPTAVIATM in July 2016.
 
Our Health Coaches provide coaching and support to their clients throughout the weight-loss and weight-maintenance process. Most new Health Coaches are introduced to the opportunity by an existing Health Coach. The vast majority of new Health Coaches started as weight-loss clients of a Health Coach, had success on the Take Shape For Life® program, and became a Health Coach to help others through the weight-loss process.
 
Take Shape For Life® is a member of the Direct Selling Association (the “DSA”), a national trade association representing over 200 direct selling companies doing business in the United States. To become a member of the DSA, Take Shape For Life®, like other active DSA member companies, underwent a comprehensive and rigorous one-year company review by DSA that included a detailed analysis of its company business-plan materials. This review is designed to ensure that a company’s business practices do not contravene DSA’s Code of Ethics. In addition to its DSA membership, Take Shape For Life® is also a voluntary DSA Code of Ethics participant, which sets higher standards for ensuring compliance. Compliance with the requirements of the Code of Ethics is paramount to becoming and remaining a member in good standing of the DSA. Accordingly, we believe membership in the DSA by Take Shape For Life® demonstrates its commitment to the highest standards of ethics and a pledge not to engage in any deceptive, unlawful, or unethical business practices, such as pyramid and other similar schemes. Moreover, Take Shape For Life®, like other DSA member companies in good standing, has pledged to provide consumers with accurate and truthful information regarding the price, grade, quality, and performance of the products Take Shape For Life® markets. In 2016, Take Shape For Life®, and its parent company Medifast® were ranked in the Direct Selling Association’s North American 50 & Global 100 lists.
 
Medifast Direct – In the direct-to-consumer business unit (“Medifast Direct”), customers order Medifast product directly through the Company’s website, www.medifastnow.com or our in-house call center. This business is driven by a multi-media customer acquisition and retention strategy that includes television, digital advertising, direct mail, email, public relations, word of mouth referrals, social media initiatives, and other means as deemed appropriate. The Medifast Direct division provides support through its social communities, in-house call center, and nutrition support team of registered dietitians to better serve its customers.
Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers – The Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers (“MWCC”) business unit sells product through franchise and reseller locations. These locations offer structured programs and a team of professionals to help customers achieve weight-loss and weight-management success at center locations. Counselors at each location work with members to provide nutritional and behavioral support based on the member’s personal needs. As of December 31, 2016, MFSI had 37 franchised centers located in Arizona, California, Louisiana, Minnesota, Maryland, and Wisconsin and 19 reseller locations in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Texas.
 
In 2008, we, through MFSI, our wholly-owned subsidiary, began offering the center model as a franchise opportunity. MFSI currently offers the Medifast Weight Control Center franchise opportunity in most states under a registered (where required) franchise disclosure document. The MFSI franchise agreement requires franchisees to develop a minimum of three Medifast Weight Control Centers within a defined geographic area in the time frame set forth in the Development Agreement between MFSI and the franchisee.
 
MFSI’s franchise strategy depends on our franchisees’ active involvement in, and management of, Medifast Weight Control Center operations. Candidates are reviewed for appropriate operational experience and financial stability, including specific net worth and liquidity requirements. Upon execution of the Franchise and Development Agreements, franchisees are required to promptly select sites for their centers, each of which are subject to MFSI’s approval.
 
A franchisee’s initial fee includes the franchise fee for their first center to be developed and a non-refundable deposit for the second and third Centers to be developed, and covers the cost of MFSI resources provided for, among other things, the training of franchisees and their staff, and approval of the proposed territory for development. If a franchisee desires to open more than three centers in the designated territory, there is an additional fee charged for each additional center to be developed.
 
Prior to the opening of each Medifast Weight Control Center franchise established under the franchise and development agreements, MFSI will do the following:
 

i. | designate the center’s protected territory.
---+--------------------------------------------

ii. | review for approval the sites selected by the franchisee for the center.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | review for approval the lease governing the location where the center is to be located.
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv. | provide the franchisee with standard plans and specifications for the build-out of the center along with a list of equipment and improvements which the franchisee is required to purchase and install.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


v. | provide an initial training program.
---+-------------------------------------


vi. | provide the franchisee on-site assistance and guidance for approximately three to five days on or about the opening of the center.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


vii. | provide the franchisee with online access to a password-protected, electronic version of the Medifast Weight Control Centers® Franchise Operations Manuals.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
MFSI may, in certain limited circumstances, cause its affiliate to provide products at a discounted price. Medifast may, in certain circumstances also guarantee a franchisee’s notes, leases or other obligations. MFSI does not offer direct or indirect financing.
 
While MFSI does not currently have a purchase option included in its Franchise and Development Agreements, it does have the right of first refusal to acquire a Center if the franchisee wishes to sell a Center.
 
In 2016, Medifast entered into distribution and licensing agreements with nineteen weight control centers previously operating as franchise locations. Under the terms of these agreements, the locations have been rebranded and offer products and services not otherwise available at Medifast Weight Control Centers. These offerings complement the Medifast products and plans, which are still utilized as the exclusive weight management program at these locations. These resellers may use Medifast’s trademarks in their marketing and advertising efforts and continue to purchase Medifast-branded products at wholesale directly from the Company.
 
Medifast Wholesale –Medifast medical provider practices carry an inventory of wholesale products and resell them to patients while providing appropriate support to help ensure healthy weight loss and weight management.
 
The Company offers resources to assist the medical providers, their staff and their patients in achieving success with their Medifast program. These medical providers have access to our nutrition support team, marketing assets and training modules to help grow their program and enable patients to achieve their weight loss and associated health goals. Medifast’s nutrition support team includes registered dietitians and a behavioral specialist who provide program support and advice via phone and email.
 
In 2012, amended in 2013, the Company entered into a strategic partnership agreement with Medix, a leader in pharmaceutical obesity products in Mexico. The agreement granted Medix an exclusive license to distribute Medifast products and programs through physicians and weight control centers in Mexico, Central America and South America under the Medifast brand. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company terminated the licensing agreement with Medix. The termination of the contract allows the Company to improve our focus on our core businesses.
 
SEASONALITY
 
Sales of the Company's weight management products and programs have historically been seasonal. Traditionally, predisposition of consumers not to initiate a weight loss or management program during the holiday season impacts the fourth quarter with fewer sales of weight management products and services. January and February generally show increases in sales, as these months are considered the commencement of the “diet season.”
SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD
 
Medifast has a Scientific Advisory Board that consists of a multi-disciplinary, international panel that serves as the foundation for scientifically-valid, consumer-centric, high quality innovations for lasting health. Its mission is to help guide Medifast in making informed decisions regarding medical, nutritional, and scientific matters by providing expertise and information on research and emerging trends.
 
The work of this cross-disciplinary group builds on Medifast’s heritage of medically sound approaches to weight loss, and the incorporation of leading-edge clinical research into the Company’s products and programs. The Scientific Advisory Board is chaired by Lawrence Cheskin, M.D., F.A.C.P., Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center.
 
COMPETITION
 
The weight-loss industry is very competitive and encompasses various weight loss products and programs. These include a wide variety of commercial weight-loss programs, pharmaceutical products, books, self-help diets, dietary supplements, appetite suppressants, and meal replacements, as well as, digital tools and wearable trackers. The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors. Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to other traditional center-based competitors, online diet oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as well as medically supervised programs.
 
Medifast’s identified peers and competitors in the general health and wellness diet industry include NutriSystem Inc., Herbalife Ltd., USANA Health Sciences, and Weight Watchers International, Inc. The Company believes that it competes effectively in the weight-loss industry and differentiates itself from the competition.
 
The Company believes its scientific and clinical heritage and commitment to evaluating its products and programs through clinical research are primary differentiators that allow it to compete in this market. Originally developed by a physician, Medifast has been on the cutting edge in the development of nutritional and weight-management products since the Company was founded. Medifast meals are individually portioned, calorie- and carbohydrate-controlled meal replacements that share a similar nutritional “footprint” and provide a balance of protein and good carbohydrates, including fiber.

Another primary differentiator is the Company’s distribution strategy which provides varying support modalities, and broadens the availability of our products and programs. The Take Shape For Life® division offers the personal support of a Health Coach, who is often a person who has achieved success with Take Shape For Life® and has turned their success into a business opportunity. Medifast Direct serves customers through the Medifast website and call center with various online support tools and resources, as well as access to program specialists and registered dietitians. MWCCs offer a supervised and structured model for customers who prefer more accountability and personalized counseling as part of their ongoing program. Medifast weight management programs utilize meal replacements as part of a structured meal plan that clinical research has shown to be effective for weight loss. Medifast medical providers offer Medifast products and programs to patients in their practice.
 
MARKETING 
 
Medifast continues to build and leverage its core Medifast brand through multiple marketing strategies. Customer acquisition and retention strategies vary by distribution business unit and may include word-of-mouth, digital marketing, television advertising, public relations, social media, email marketing, events, and other means. These mediums are used to target new customers by stressing Medifast's and Take Shape For Life’s® simple and effective approach to weight loss and management and long term health. Many of these programs are also utilized to reactivate, encourage and support existing customers, clients, and Health Coaches. Medifast and Take Shape For Life® continue to enhance all company materials and websites.
MANUFACTURING 
 
Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures and produces all Medifast powder-based products, which accounts for approximately 43% of Medifast’s product revenues, in the manufacturing facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. The Company purchased the plant in July 2002 and has gradually increased production capacity and improved overall efficiencies with additional investments in blending and packaging equipment. The remaining 57% of Medifast products are manufactured by third party vendors in accordance with Medifast proprietary formulas and manufacturing standards. Our Owings Mills manufacturing facility is regulated and inspected by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

The FDA and USDA and State and local Health departments are the major agencies whose regulatory mission is to assure that products are made using approved ingredients, labeling, manufacturing procedures and testing to ensure that safe quality products are delivered to consumers. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has principal regulatory authority over the Company’s advertising and trade practices, its enforcement powers are aimed at protecting the consumer from being deceived by unfair marketing and trading practices.
 
Historically, the FTC has filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials and claims for program success. In 2012, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a consent decree with the FTC regarding certain statements included in the advertising for the Company’s weight-loss programs. The consent decree requires us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of products and services.
 
PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INSURANCE 
 
The Company, like other producers and distributors of ingested products, faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of its products results in injury or death. The Company maintains insurance against product liability claims with respect to the products it manufactures. With respect to the retail and direct marketing distribution of products produced by others, the Company's principal form of insurance consists of arrangements with each of its suppliers of those products to name the Company a covered entity under each of such vendor's product liability insurance policies. The Company does not buy products from suppliers who do not maintain such coverage.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed 422 employees, of whom 187 were engaged in manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain support, and 235 in marketing, administrative, call center and corporate support functions.
