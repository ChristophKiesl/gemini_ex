Item 1.  Business

OVERVIEW

Our award-winning assets include one of the nation's largest portfolios of master planned communities (MPCs) spanning approximately 118,000 gross acres, as well as operating properties, strategic developments, and other unique assets across 9 states from New York to Hawai‘i. We create some of the most sought-after communities in the country by curating an environment tailored to meet the needs of our residents and tenants. Our unique business model allows us to drive outsized risk-adjusted returns while maintaining a sharp focus on sustainability to ensure our communities are equipped with the resources to last several decades.
We operate through four business segments: Operating Assets, MPCs, Strategic Developments and Seaport. We create a unique and continuous value-creation cycle through our operational and financial synergies associated with our three primary business segments of Operating Assets, MPCs and Strategic Developments. In our MPC segment, we plan, develop and manage small cities and large-scale, mixed-use communities, in markets with strong long-term growth fundamentals. This business focuses on the horizontal development of residential land. The improved acreage is then sold to homebuilders that build and sell homes to new residents. New homeowners create demand for commercial developments, such as retail, office, self-storage and hospitality offerings. We build these commercial properties through Strategic Developments at the appropriate time using the cash flow harvested from the sale of land to homebuilders, which helps mitigate development risk. Once the commercial developments are completed, the assets transition to Operating Assets, which increase recurring Net Operating Income (NOI), further funding our Strategic Developments. New office, retail and other commercial amenities make our MPC residential land more appealing to buyers and increase the velocity of land sales at premiums that typically exceed the broader market. This increased demand for residential land generates more cash flow from MPCs, thus continuing the value-creation cycle. Our fourth business segment, the Seaport, is one of the few multi-block districts largely under private management by a single owner in New York City. This historic waterfront area is being revitalized and enhanced into a mixed-use neighborhood featuring unique culinary and entertainment offerings. 
Our assets are located across the United States with the vast majority of the assets in our Operating Assets segment located within our MPCs. This helps us achieve scale and, in most cases, critical mass, which leads to; pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations; increased ability to attract, hire and retain the best local leadership and leasing teams; flexibility to meet changing customer demands; and enhanced ability to identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our MPCs, including our Trillium joint venture, span approximately 118,000 gross acres, with approximately 25,000 residential acres of land remaining to be developed and sold in high demand geographic areas. In addition to the residential land, our MPC segment contains approximately 13,000 acres designated for commercial development or sale to non-competing users such as hospitals. This land is held in our MPC segment until we identify demand for a new commercial development, at which point the land is transitioned into our Strategic Developments segment. 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2010. Through our predecessors, we have been in business for several decades. Financial information about each of our segments is presented in Note 18 - Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Douglas Ranch Acquisition

In October 2021, HHC announced the launch of Douglas Ranch, a new large-scale master planned community in the West Valley of the greater Phoenix, Arizona area. The Company closed on the all-cash purchase of approximately 33,810 acres for a purchase price of $541.0 million. The purchase price includes an option for the seller, JDM Partners, to re-acquire a 50% interest in the property for an additional $236.8 million, with $33.8 million of the original purchase price being credited to the seller upon exercise of the option for a total capital contribution of $270.6 million. If the option is not exercised by the seller, the $33.8 million will be returned to the Company. Simultaneous with the land acquisition, the Company closed on the acquisition of a 50% interest in Trillium Development Holding Company, LLC, for $59.0 million. This development holding company owns approximately 3,029 acres of land in the greater Phoenix, Arizona area. Trillium is Douglas Ranch’s first village to begin development with land sales expected to occur in the first half of 2022. In total, the Douglas Ranch MPC encompasses almost 37,000 fully-entitled, “shovel-ready” acres and is poised for growth with in-place entitlements for 100,000 residential homes and 55 million square feet of commercial development.

Executive Transition

Effective January 12, 2022, with the Company’s announcement, Carlos Olea was appointed to serve as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Mr. Olea succeeds Correne Loeffler, who assumed the Company's CFO role in 2021 after HHC's then-CFO, David O'Reilly, was appointed as Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Olea has been with The Howard Hughes Corporation since 2017 and has served as the company's Chief Accounting Officer since 2019, overseeing the financial accounting strategy for the one of the nation's largest portfolios of MPCs during a time of outstanding growth. Prior to joining HHC, Mr. Olea served as Chief Accounting Officer at Carr Properties, a Washington, D.C.-based owner-operator and developer. Previously, he was a Senior Manager with the Advisory Services practice of Ernst and Young and a Director of Technical Accounting and Financial Reporting with AvalonBay Communities in Arlington, Virginia.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other real estate companies through the following competitive strengths:
–Management Team with Track Record of Value Creation. We have completed the development of over 7.1 million square feet of office and retail operating properties, 3,807 multi-family units and 909 hospitality keys since 2011. Excluding land which we own, we have invested approximately $2.6 billion in these developments, which is projected to generate a 9.5% yield on cost, or $248.6 million per year of NOI upon stabilization. At today’s market cap rates, this implies value creation to our shareholders in excess of $1.5 billion. Our investment of approximately $690.4 million of cash equity in our development projects since inception, which is computed as total costs excluding land less the related construction debt, is projected to generate a 23.4% return on cash equity assuming a 4.5% cost of debt, which approximates our weighted-average cost. These investments and returns exclude condominium development as well as projects under construction such as the Seaport. We exclude condominium developments since they do not result in recurring NOI, and we exclude projects under development due to the wider range of NOI they are expected to generate upon stabilization. In Ward Village, we have either opened or have under construction 3,046 condominium units, which have approximately 95.3% units sold as of December 31, 2021.
–Unique, Diverse Portfolio. We own a portfolio with many diverse market leading assets located across nine states with a combination of steady cash flow and longer-term value creation opportunities.
–Significant Value Creation Opportunity. We own one of the preeminent development pipelines in the world, and with the acquisition of Douglas Ranch, we now have over 100 million square feet of vertical entitlements remaining across our portfolio. This represents approximately 14 times the 7.1 million square feet we have delivered in the last eleven years without having to acquire another development site or external asset, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage over other real estate development corporations.
–Flexible Balance Sheet. After the $600.0 million all-cash acquisition of Douglas Ranch and Trillium in the fourth quarter of 2021, we ended the year with $843.2 million of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2021, our total debt equaled approximately 47.9% of the book value of our total assets, which we believe is significantly less than our market value. Our net debt, which includes our share of debt of Real estate and other affiliates less cash and Special Improvement District (SID) and Municipal Utility District (MUD) receivables, equaled approximately 38.6% of our total enterprise value. Real estate and other affiliates refers to partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the development and operation of real estate assets. Our strong balance sheet provides substantial insulation against potential downturns and provides us with the flexibility to evaluate new real estate project opportunities.
–Self-Funded Business Plan. One of our key differentiators is our ability to self-fund significant portions of our new development without having to dispose of our recently completed developments. Our residential land sales, recurring NOI and profits on the sales of condominium units generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, which is used to fund the equity required to execute our many development opportunities. Furthermore, we are not required to pay dividends nor are we restricted from investing in any asset type, amenity or service, unlike many other real estate companies, which are limited in their activities because they have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (REIT). We believe our structure currently provides us with significant financial and operating flexibility to maximize the value of our real estate portfolio.

Competition

The nature and extent of our competition depends on the type of property involved. With respect to our Operating Assets and Seaport segments, we primarily compete for retail and office tenants. We also compete for residential tenants in our Operating Assets segment. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include: (1) consumer demographics; (2) age, quality, design and location of properties; (3) neighboring real estate projects that have been developed or that we, or others, may develop in the future; (4) diversity of retailers and anchor tenants at shopping center locations; (5) management and operational expertise; and (6) rental rates. The principal factors influencing tenant leasing decisions for our office space include: (1) rental rates; (2) attractive views; (3) walkable retail; (4) commute time; (5) efficiency of space; and (6) demographics of available workforce. For residential tenants of our multi-family properties in our Operating Assets segment, we believe the principal factors that impact their decision of where to live are: (1) walkability/proximity to work; (2) amenities; and (3) the best value for their money. 
With respect to our MPC segment, we compete with other landholders and residential and commercial property developers primarily in the development of properties within Las Vegas, Nevada; the greater Houston, Texas area; Phoenix, Arizona; and the Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. markets. Significant factors that we believe allow us to compete effectively in this business include:
–the size and scope of our MPCs
–strong reputation within the industry and years of experience serving our communities
–the recreational and cultural amenities available within our communities
–the commercial centers in the communities, including the properties that we own and/or operate or may develop
–our relationships with homebuilders
–our level of debt relative to total assets
–the proximity of our developments to major metropolitan areas
With respect to our Strategic Developments segment and certain developable assets in our Seaport segment, including the Tin Building and 250 Water Street, our direct competitors include other commercial property developers and other owners of commercial real estate that engage in similar businesses. With respect to our Strategic Developments segment, we also compete with residential condominium developers. With significant existing entitlements, we hold an advantage over many of our competitors in our markets in that we already own and control, or have significant influence over, substantial acreage for development. We also own the majority of square feet of each product type in many of our markets.

Operating Assets

We have developed many of the assets in our Operating Assets segment since the Company’s inception in 2010. As of December 31, 2021, we have 74 Operating Assets, including our investments in joint ventures and other assets, consisting of 15 retail, 33 office, 13 multi-family and 13 other operating assets and investments. Excluding our projects under construction, we own approximately 10.4 million square feet of retail and office space and 4,200 multi-family units. 
We believe that the long-term value of our Operating Assets is driven by their concentration in our MPCs where we have a unique level of control and competitive advantage. We believe that these assets have the potential for future growth by increasing rental rates, absorbing remaining vacancy and changing the tenant mix in retail centers to improve gross sales revenue of our tenants, thereby increasing rents.
Revenue is primarily generated through rental services and is directly impacted by trends in rental rates and operating costs. Leases related to our office properties are generally triple net leases in The Woodlands, gross leases in Summerlin and modified gross leases in Columbia. Leases related to our retail properties are primarily triple net leases, which generally require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of property operating costs, such as real estate taxes, utilities and insurance, and the direct costs of their leased space. We also enter into certain leases which require tenants to pay a fixed rate per square foot reimbursement for common area costs that increase annually according to the terms of the lease.
We will also occasionally sell an operating asset when it does not complement our existing properties or no longer fits within our current strategy. In 2021, the Company completed the sale of The Woodlands Resort, The Westin at The Woodlands and Embassy Suites at Hughes Landing for $252.0 million. These hospitality properties, located in The Woodlands, contained a total of 909 rooms. 
For certain assets, we believe there are opportunities to improve operating performance through redevelopment or repositioning. Redevelopment plans for these assets may include office, retail or residential space, shopping centers, movie theaters, parking complexes or open space. The redevelopment plans may require that we obtain permits, licenses, consents and/or waivers from various parties. These opportunities will require new capital investment and vary in complexity and scale. The redevelopment opportunities range from those that would have minimal disruption to the property to those requiring partial or full demolition of existing structures for new construction. Factors we evaluate in determining whether to redevelop or reposition an asset include the following: (1) existing and forecasted demographics surrounding the property; (2) competition related to existing and/or alternative uses; (3) existing entitlements of the property and our ability to change them; (4) compatibility of the physical site with proposed uses; and (5) environmental considerations, traffic patterns and access to the properties.
We generally transfer an operating asset that is being repositioned or redeveloped into our Strategic Developments segment when we close operations at a property and/or begin construction on the redevelopment project. Upon completion of construction or renovation of a development or redevelopment, the asset is fully or partially placed in service and transferred back into our Operating Assets segment.

Master Planned Communities

As of December 31, 2021, we own the MPCs of Summerlin in Las Vegas; The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland in the Houston region; Douglas Ranch in the Phoenix region; and Columbia in Maryland. Our MPC segment includes the development and sale of residential and commercial land, primarily in large-scale, long-term projects. These developments often require decades of investment and continued focus on the changing market dynamics surrounding these communities. We believe that the long-term value of our MPCs remains strong because of their competitive positioning in their respective markets, our in-depth experience in diverse land use planning and the fact that we have substantially completed the entitlement processes within the majority of our communities.
Our MPCs have won numerous awards for design excellence and for community contribution. Summerlin and Bridgeland were again ranked by Robert Charles Lesser & Co., LLC (RCLCO), capturing third and fifteenth highest selling master planned communities in the nation, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.

BUSINESS | Index to Financial Statements

We expect the competitive position, desirable locations and land development expertise to drive the long-term growth of our MPCs. As of December 31, 2021, our MPCs, including our Trillium joint venture, encompass approximately 118,000 gross acres of land and include approximately 38,000 remaining saleable acres of land. Residential sales, which are generated primarily from the sale of finished lots and undeveloped superpads to residential homebuilders and developers, include standard and custom parcels designated for detached and attached single family homes, and range from entry-level to luxury homes. Superpad sites are generally 20- to 25-acre parcels of unimproved land where we develop and construct the major utilities (water, sewer and storm drainage) and roads to the borders of the parcel and the homebuilder completes the on-site utilities, roads and finished lots. Revenue is also generated through price participation with homebuilders.
We also occasionally sell or lease land for commercial development when we deem its use will not compete with our existing properties or our development strategy. Commercial sales include land parcels designated for retail, office, hospitality, high density residential projects (e.g., condominiums and apartments), services and other for-profit activities, as well as those parcels designated for use by government, schools and other not-for-profit entities.

Seaport

The Seaport spans 461,000 square feet and several city blocks, including Pier 17, the Tin Building, the Historic District and the 250 Water Street parking lot. Our Seaport segment is part non-stabilized operating asset, part development project and part operating business. The Seaport businesses are comprised of the landlord operations, managed businesses and events and sponsorships categories. As we own, either entirely or in joint venture, many of the businesses, the NOI and stabilization of the Seaport is less predictable than our Operating Assets segment.
Throughout 2021, we have continued to execute on our long-term vision for the Seaport. Construction of the core and shell of the Tin Building is complete, with opening expected in the first half of 2022. We have also announced two new concepts at the Fulton Market Building in the space previously occupied by 10 Corso Como. In the summer of 2022, in a joint partnership with Endorphin Ventures, we expect to launch The Lawn Club, an immersive indoor and outdoor experience that includes an extensive indoor grass area, a stylish clubhouse bar and a wide variety of lawn games. We also expect to launch a new restaurant concept by Josh Eden and Wylie Dufresne at 1 Fulton Street in the summer of 2022. Total estimated aggregate project costs remaining to be spent and funded by us as of December 31, 2021, for the Seaport projects currently under construction are $69.6 million. 
In December 2021, we obtained the final approval by the City of New York of our 250 Water Street development project, which includes the transformation of this underutilized full-block surface parking lot into a mixed-use development that would include affordable and market-rate apartments, community-oriented spaces and office space. Also in December 2021, an amendment to the Seaport ground lease was executed giving the Company extension options, at the discretion of the Company, for an additional 48 years from its current expiration in 2072 until 2120. We expect to begin comprehensive remediation of the site through the New York State Brownfield Cleanup program and break ground on the development in 2022. In February 2022, an additional lawsuit was filed challenging the land use approvals previously granted to the Company under the ULURP for the redevelopment and construction of 250 Water Street. The Company intends to vigorously contest the matter as it believes that these claims are without merit. 

Strategic Developments

Our Strategic Developments segment consists of 19 development or redevelopment projects, including developments within our MPCs that will transition to Operating Assets upon completion and condominium towers at Ward Village. Many of these developments require extensive planning and expertise in large-scale and long-range development to maximize their highest and best uses. The strategic process is complex and unique to each asset and requires on-going assessment of the changing market dynamics prior to the commencement of construction. We must study each local market, determine the highest and best use of the land and necessary improvements to the area, obtain entitlements and permits, complete architectural design and construction drawings, secure tenant commitments and obtain and commit sources of capital.
We are in various stages of predevelopment or execution of our strategic plans for many of these assets based on market conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we had 8 properties under construction and not yet placed into service. Total estimated aggregate project costs remaining to be spent on our properties under construction as of December 31, 2021, were $916.4 million, of which $54.7 million remains to be funded by us and the balance will be funded with existing debt. We generally obtain construction financing to fund the majority of the costs associated with developing these assets.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)

Maintaining a sustainable approach to development is at the heart of what we do—it is our commitment to our stakeholders, to our communities, and to the world in which we live. This sense of responsibility has guided the growth of our master planned communities for many decades—long before the principles of environmental, social, and corporate governance fostered the global movement known as ESG. HHC’s legacy is our proven track record of long-term development that embodies our profound respect for conservation and inclusive communities. 
Today we are at an exciting juncture with the opportunity to reevaluate our ESG targets, explore different measurements, and elevate our commitment to driving positive change and doing good. Our ESG program is overseen by our CEO, President and Board of Directors. Additional details on our approach are available in our latest ESG annual report, which can be found on the Company’s website at www.howardhughes.com/hhsustainability.

Environmental Strategy and Performance

Our master planned communities were founded on the large scale exploration of many of the smart growth principles that are being promoted today, and we have remained on a path of open space preservation, innovation, community connectivity, and integration with nature ever since. The critical component of our approach has always been to remain nimble and ready to innovate in the face of evolving urban landscapes.
In 2017, we set 10-year environmentally focused goals as the ESG movement developed. In 2020, we took the initiative to review our goals going forward. Reducing carbon emissions, energy and water use year-over-year is a comprehensive goal of our operational strategy. We achieve these reductions through systematic energy auditing, mechanical, lighting and other building upgrades, in an effort to optimize operations and engage tenants. 
We report our progress against the goals annually in our ESG report and leverage industry leadership programs to benchmark environmental performance. We worked with DNV GL Business Assurance USA, Inc. to externally confirm our energy consumption, water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and waste data. HHC’s developments pursue U.S. Green Building Council’s green building certification program; Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and eligible operational assets pursue U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR rating among other industry benchmarks that independently assess and recognize efficiencies and performance.
In 2021, HHC continued to expand its environmentally focused programs across business segments, including real-time data analysis, carbon emission reduction, climate risk management, passive design strategy, embodied carbon evaluation, renewable energy installations and achieving higher levels of green building and green community certifications through LEED. We partner with industry leading subject matter experts; Ramboll, Thorton Tomasetti, Studio Gang, SOM, InSite Intelligence, Verdani partners, and others to accelerate the positive impact across the lifecycle of our MPCs, strategic developments and operating assets.
HHC continued to make strides with ESG performance and transparency by participating in its fourth Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) Real Estate Assessment. HHC scored significantly above the global average, ranking in the upper third of the North America Diversified, Listed category for the GRESB Standing Investments Benchmark. Despite the rising competition within the benchmark, we earned a GRESB 4 Star Rating. Since 2018, HHC’s overall GRESB score has improved by 23%.

Social Strategy and Impact

Human Capital The Howard Hughes Corporation builds vibrant, diverse and culturally rich communities that will deliver an exceptional quality of life for generations to come. We accomplish this through the dedication of the talented people that make up our workforce who are committed to masterful planning and design and the mission of long-term sustainability. Our team members are empowered to help people discover new ways of experiencing life. Our master planned communities continue the work of the forward-thinking placemakers whose collective legacy of innovation, imagination, and excellence form the basis of our company - James Rouse, George Mitchell, Victoria Ward and Howard Hughes. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 530 employees supporting our core business, with an additional 116 employed at the Las Vegas Ballpark, including seasonal staff required to support ongoing ballpark events and merchandising operations.

We recognize that our people are the lifeblood of our Company. As such, we offer competitive wellness programs to support our employees and their families at all stages of life, including a robust health benefits plan, a 401k and match plan, a fully paid 12-week maternity leave and four weeks of child bonding leave for both the birth of a child or placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. We are also proud to be a mother-friendly worksite, providing a supportive environment and the necessary facilities for nursing mothers. We encourage personal discovery for our team members and advocate for personal and professional growth through tuition reimbursement, student debt management resources and a personal growth fund for non-job-related training. 
The continuous professional development of our employees is intrinsically linked to our Company’s ever-evolving design and development of inclusive, sustainable community living. The growth of our development pipeline creates great opportunities for all employees to benefit in career advancement and mobility. Through the growth of our employees comes the growth of our company, wherein lies the long-term success and evolution of our communities. The most recent launch of Douglas Ranch, our new 37,000-acre master planned community in Phoenix’s West Valley, allows us to leverage the team’s expertise while capitalizing on an incredibly refined and successfully proven business model. 
Health, Safety and Well-Being We enforce the highest standards for building operations to protect the health, well-being and safety of our employees, tenants, residents and visitors. We are dedicated to improving quality of life by developing properties with healthy spaces to live, work, relax and socialize. We also believe that attracting and retaining the best talent means we must strive to provide an inclusive work environment in which employees feel valued and safe. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, safety and well-being of employees and their families has remained of paramount importance. The Company put in place policies and protocols based on the expertise and guidance from public health leaders, and has continued to regularly review and update policies and protocols to reflect the best, most current information available. Beginning in March of 2020, we instituted a remote workplace strategy for employees whose job duties were conducive to working from home. In April 2021, we implemented a voluntary return to office program, which allowed employees to return to our offices on a voluntary basis only. This voluntary program continued until November 1, 2021, at which time we began our mandatory return to office program, applying a hybrid work model. As part of both the voluntary and mandatory return to office programs, we implemented extensive safety measures to protect our employees, including enhanced sanitary procedures and tailored policies for vaccinated and unvaccinated employees. We continue to adjust to the fluidity of the pandemic, as recently as implementing more stringent testing protocols due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant.
Our employees’ safe working environment remains a focus in our occupational health and safety practices. Competency-based online safety training is provided to employees covering a broad range of hazards that may be encountered in the workplace. Our safety and loss control expert, supported by external expertise if needed, analyze the circumstances and consequences of an incident for corrective measures. Our recordable incident and lost time recordable incident rates (statistical numbers measuring the number of accidents per hours worked) directly reflects the emphasis placed on our commitment to these practices.
We are committed to providing affordable benefits for our employees. For 2022, we will focus on bringing more services to support our employees in their mental and physical well-being. The organization introduced a new hybrid work model to assist employees with juggling work, family and life-related issues. We are including in our medical services the opportunity to support families with the introduction of fertility services which is inclusive of adoption, donor, and surrogacy services. We are implementing a bike reimbursement program to help employees stay healthy and save the environment by biking to work. We are also partnering with a new health and wellness vendor to provide alternative methods for our employees to stay active and healthy during their fitness journey.
Our Commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity  We believe it is the responsibility of each officer, manager and supervisor to ensure all employment activities are conducted with fairness. We are committed to recruiting, hiring, developing and promoting the best individuals based on job-related qualifications, and without regard to race, religion, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other reason prohibited by law. We do not tolerate differential treatment, and we believe that any practice toward employees or candidates that may get in the way of that duty hinders us all. We provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with a disability, as required by law, under the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable statutes. Sexual or any other type of workplace harassment is not tolerated at HHC, and any employee who engages in discriminatory conduct or workplace harassment is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Diversity and Inclusion  At The Howard Hughes Corporation, we value perspective. We believe in celebrating unique ideas and embracing different points of view. Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are essential to our success as a company and we strive to source, engage and retain diverse and talented people, partners, residents, and suppliers. We invest in our people through continuous learning opportunities and nurture the exchange of ideas. By maintaining an open dialogue and fostering new relationships, we can cultivate a culture of belonging. Because better people make better companies, and better companies build better communities. Through our people strategy, we strive for diversification and retention of talent that ultimately drives top performance, diverse thought and an inclusive culture. As of December 31, 2021, our workforce is 54% female and 33% ethnically diverse. Employees at a Vice President level or above are 34% female and 18% ethnically diverse.
Since 2020, to ensure that the company is actively fostering a diverse and inclusive environment, HHC, with significant interest from its employees, formed and appointed an all-volunteer employee DEI Advisory Council, DEI Review Board and a dedicated resource for DEI. Together, with the Culture + People team, HHC executes its DEI strategy through programs and policies such as the Summer Associate Program, Employee Resource Groups, Training + Development, Employee Growth Benefits, Strategic Talent Acquisition Partnerships and Annual DEI Goals. 
Our Summer Associate Program has been an excellent source for attracting and identifying high-performing diverse talent. Summer Associates experience a competitive and rigorous rotational curriculum. This program is a culmination of the commitment and dedication of the HHC team and their investment in the future of the Company. 
In January of 2022, HHC announced a partnership with Project Destined. Sharing a commitment to developing a more diverse and inclusive generation of new leaders within the real estate industry, the partnership launches the entry of Project Destined into the Greater Houston area for the first time as it continues to mentor and transform the industry with more equitable opportunities and standards. Project Destined partners with leading real estate firms and more than 70 universities around the country to enable and encourage a diverse group of underrepresented students to explore the industry through internships and the analysis of live local real estate deals. Student interns will be paired with mentors from HHC to participate in Project Destined-led training, mentor office hours and competitive team pitch presentations.
Philanthropy  HHC is highly attuned to how we impact the lives of those within our communities, and we support over 350 causes of local charities through donations and volunteerism. In 2021, we donated over $3 million through our corporate social responsibility program, Howard Hughes Cares (HHCares). We offer all full-time employees 24 hours per year to volunteer, a 1:1 match on financial donations to the charity of their choice and time off to exercise voting rights, all of which reflects our commitment to sustaining the communities where we live and work.
Professional Development  We empower employees to grow at every stage of their career. Full-time employees are eligible for up to $10,000 annually in reimbursement for professional growth, including continuing higher education and professional certifications, of which $1,000 is allocated to personal growth opportunities. In addition, conference and seminar attendance is encouraged throughout the Company, to promote networking, learning and firsthand industry experience. Throughout the years, our employees have participated in hundreds of conferences and engaged with industry-leading organizations, including the research and educational nonprofit Urban Land Institute (ULI). For those employees with student debt, we also provide a company-funded contribution plan to help reduce their repayment amount. At HHC, we love education, and we know it has its price. We want our employees to focus on and plan for their future, not be bogged down with student debt. 
Ethics Compliance Training We believe that strong, well-established ethics are a key tenet of our culture. Training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is required for all employees throughout their time with Howard Hughes. Our training guides employees through engaging in ethical business decisions, recognizing unethical behaviors and reporting when necessary. This training framework is our foundation from which all employees reinstate their understanding and acceptance of our organizational values on an annual basis.

Governance and Risk Management

In order to identify, monitor, and mitigate potential risks that could impact our organization and investors, The Howard Hughes Corporation has made governance risk and management a top Board priority. As part of our corporate governance framework, we have a formal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Program that is overseen by the Board’s Risk Committee and led by our Risk Management team. The Risk Committee helps to evaluate the effectiveness of the ERM Program and the performance of the Risk Management team. It also reviews and monitors risks that have been identified and are considered critical by management, such as capital, market, liquidity, legal, regulatory, operational, reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Committee reviews and approves periodic risk assessment results and reviews risk mitigation activities deemed material by management. The Risk Committee also reviews risk mitigation activities for emerging risks and oversees management’s approach to fostering a risk-intelligent culture.
HHC’s ESG program, is shaped and supported by the Board and encompasses a range of corporate governance policies and guidelines that include but are not limited to: Anti-Corruption Compliance Policy, Board Diversity Policy, Cybersecurity Policy, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Officers and Employees, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and Insider Trading Policy.
Substantially all of our properties have been subject to third-party Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs), which are intended to evaluate the environmental condition of the surveyed and surrounding properties. This includes the 250 Water Street property in the Seaport, which we purchased in June 2018. The Phase I ESA identified historic fill, probable gasoline underground storage tanks, and historical factory and other industrial uses (including a gasoline service station and a thermometer factory) on the property and in the area. A limited Phase II Environmental Site Investigation (ESI) for 250 Water Street confirmed the presence of typical historic fill; an anomaly consistent with an underground petroleum storage tank; and an associated area of petroleum impacts; and mercury in soil at levels above New York State regulatory criteria. The property’s current use as a parking lot does not require remediation at this time. The property is in the New York State Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) with the Company as a Volunteer (an entity not responsible for the contamination and not responsible for cleaning up off-site contamination), and will be remediated, as necessary, under the BCP prior to or concurrent with future redevelopment activities. More recently and under the BCP, the 250 Water Street property has been fully investigated and the findings confirm those from the Phase I ESA and Phase II ESI. 
As of December 31, 2021, neither the ESA or ESI for 250 Water Street, nor the completed ESAs of our other properties, have revealed any known environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial position or results of operations. Nevertheless, it is possible that these assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that the conditions have changed since the assessments were prepared (typically prior to the time the property was purchased or encumbered with debt). Moreover, no assurances can be given that future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on us, or the current environmental condition of our properties will not be adversely affected by tenants and occupants of the properties, by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties unrelated to us.

REGULATORY MATTERS

A portion of our business is dedicated to the development and sale of condominiums. Condominiums are generally regulated by an agency of the state in which they are located or where the condominiums are marketed to be sold. In connection with our development and offering of condominium units for sale, we must submit regulatory filings to various state agencies and engage in an entitlement process by which real property owned under one title is converted into individual units. Responses or comments on our condominium filings may delay our ability to sell condominiums in certain states and other jurisdictions in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, approval to develop real property sometimes requires political support and generally entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requires discretionary action by local governments. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. We incur substantial costs to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
Various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, health and safety, site and building design, environment, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the real estate development industry. Our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained depends on factors beyond our control, such as changes in federal, state and local policies, rules and regulations and their interpretations and application.
There is a variety of legislation being enacted, or considered for enactment, at the federal, state and local level relating to energy and climate change. This legislation relates to items such as carbon dioxide emissions control and building codes that impose energy efficiency standards. New building code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards could significantly increase our cost to construct buildings. As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation and regulations of this nature are expected to continue and become more costly to comply with. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. Energy-related initiatives affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States and the world and, because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials, such as lumber, steel and concrete, they could have an indirect adverse impact on our operations and profitability to the extent the manufacturers and suppliers of our materials are burdened with expensive cap and trade and similar energy related taxes and regulations. Governmental regulation also affects sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. Further, government agencies routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. We may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed communities, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of remediation of certain hazardous substances, including petroleum and certain toxic substances (collectively hazardous substances) on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous substances. The costs of remediation of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to obtain financing using such real estate as collateral. Other federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations require abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of demolition or certain renovations or remodeling, the cost of which may be substantial for certain redevelopments, and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Federal and state laws also regulate the operation and removal of underground storage tanks. In connection with our ownership, operation and management of certain properties, we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to these regulated substances or tanks or related claims.
Additionally, changes to our procedures or additional procedures, implemented to comply with public health orders or best practice guidelines as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may increase our costs or reduce our productivity and thereby affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
