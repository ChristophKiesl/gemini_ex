Our Company 
 We are an early stage blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target. 
 While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, our search is focused on the cybersecurity, safety, security and privacy, or CSSP, sector, which complements the expertise of our management team. 
 Business Strategy 
 Dave DeWalt, Mark Garrett, Ken Gonzalez, Morgan Kyauk, Steve Simonian, Kara Wilson and Barbara Massa are referred to as the NightDragon Team throughout this report. The NightDragon Team’s business strategy is to identify, evaluate and complete an initial business combination with a company in the CSSP industry that has proven products that are solving a large pain point for organizations and can benefit from the power of the NightDragon Team to take it to the next level. We intend to acquire a company that has sufficient scale to be a successful public company which can benefit from our knowledge of, and access to, capital markets to further invest in organic and inorganic growth initiatives, as well as benefit from partnering with a team that has a deep bench of operating and deal making experience, as well as strong trusted relationships in the industry. 
Focus on a Large Addressable Market 
 The NightDragon Team is focused on the large, rapidly growing CSSP market, which consists of the information technology, or IT, security and counterspace security markets. We estimate the total CSSP market to be $131 billion in 2020, growing to $183 billion in 2024, at a 9% compound annual growth rate. This is in comparison to the broader information and Communications Technology market’s 2020-2024 compound annual growth rate of 3.5%, according to IDC. The IT security market is estimated by IDC to reach $175 billion by 2024. The global counterspace security market is estimated by BIS Research to reach $8 billion by 2024. According to PitchBook Data, as of January 2021, cybersecurity alone has more than 70 private companies that have received at least four venture financing rounds. This market has experienced significant growth driven by a confluence of factors, including rapid technological innovation and adoption driving expansion of attack surface, rise of financially and ideologically motivated adversaries, widely available markets for attacker tools, geopolitical tensions, lack of innovation from existing vendors, increasing regulation, a dramatic shortage in security-related talent and the impact of COVID-19.
A “perfect security storm” of factors is driving the continued growth of the massive $131 billion CSSP market, and includes: 
 

• | Rapid Technological Innovation and Adoption Drives Expansion of Attack Surface: Significant re-platforming of consumer and enterprise technologies such as cloud computing, digital identities, mobile devices, blockchain, artificial intelligence, social networks, satellites, digitalization of supply chains, IoT devices and drones have fundamentally changed the way we live, work and play. This rapid technological innovation exponentially expands the attack surface for adversaries to capitalize on, resulting in the need for new, innovative CSSP products and solutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rise of Financially and Ideologically Motivated Adversaries: Outside of nation states, the attacker landscape has evolved significantly since the early 2000s, when viruses were largely nuisances and created for show and notoriety. More adversaries armed with greater resources have contributed to an increasingly sophisticated and disruptive attack landscape, including the rise of ransomware. According to the 2020 CrowdStrike Global Security Attitude Survey, 56% of respondents’ organizations have suffered a ransomware attack in the last 12 months, with an average amount of $1.1 million being paid to attackers by those organizations forced to make such payment. Furthermore, anonymity on the internet, cryptocurrency, smart contracts and blockchain-based applications have contributed to automated at-scale attacks and emboldened threat actors to step up hacktivism, cybercrime, espionage, terrorism and cyber warfare.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Widely Available Markets for Attacker Tools: The rise of the “sharing” economy has been accompanied by the rise of sharing, and collaboration between financially, ideologically and nation-state driven attackers. With anonymization and use of cryptocurrencies on the rise, vulnerabilities and exploit kits are now easily accessible on the internet with the dark web, providing a low-cost and efficient way for attackers to achieve their goals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geopolitical Tensions: Nation states have been cyber adversaries since the earliest days of the internet. Countries such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, to name a few, have become hotbeds of attacker innovation and rapidly increasing capabilities. With geopolitical tensions on the rise and a lack of internet governance or viable law enforcement models, there is little reason to believe similar attacks will not continue.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



2 

  
• | Lack of Innovation from Existing Vendors: A recent Mandiant study found that existing security tools missed 53% of attacks against enterprises. The inability of the legacy security providers to detect and prevent attacks has also contributed to the growth of the CSSP market. Their lack of innovation has driven aggressive procurement of newer best-of-breed solutions principally coming from younger, emerging companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing Regulation: With the General Data Protection Regulation now in effect in the European Union, or E.U., and anticipated new regulations in the United States, organizations are increasing their focus on cybersecurity and must ensure that they have the resources available to be in compliance with novel pieces of legislation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Massive Skills Shortage: The 2020 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study estimates that there was a shortage of 3.1 million individuals to meet the cybersecurity workforce demand globally in 2020, leaving government and commercial organizations unprepared for the cyberattacks they face. This growing shortage has driven CSSP spending as organizations seek automated solutions to reduce workforce staffing dependencies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | COVID-19: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused institutions to fundamentally re-evaluate their organizational processes and business models, leading to a massive increase in remote work and use of distributed technology applications and systems. These changes have caused a corresponding increase in the vulnerability of employees accessing mission critical applications, essential IT systems and sensitive data from unprotected locations. The changing nature of work driven by the pandemic is shaping new architectures and new priorities in spend, creating opportunities for CSSP companies to satisfy the demand for new security products and solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The ramifications of the “perfect security storm” of factors are evidenced in the latest seminal and ongoing cybersecurity hacking campaign described below. 
 

• | Recent Seminal Event: On December 16, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, issued a joint statement confirming that they have become aware of a significant and ongoing cybersecurity hacking campaign. CISA is tracking this cyber incident which has impacted enterprise networks across federal, state and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations. CISA noted that an advanced persistent threat actor is responsible for compromising SolarWinds Orion software supply chain, as well as widespread abuse of commonly used authentication mechanisms. CISA has highlighted that this threat actor has the resources, patience and expertise to gain access to and privileges over highly sensitive information if left unchecked. As a result, CISA is urging organizations to prioritize measures to identify and address this threat.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This recent and significant seminal event illuminates how the security landscape continues to evolve and become more dangerous. Rapid technological innovation has expanded the attack surface exponentially in both the digital and the physical domain, including ground-based information technology, or IT, and operational technology, or OT, networks as well as in air drones and satellite-based platforms. We believe a large unmet need exists to secure this rapidly evolving technology footprint. 
 Our sector focus on CSSP encompasses technologies that protect and defend the following growing technology areas: 
 



• | Cloud: Growing use of cloud computing has fueled demand for securing cloud infrastructure and cloud-delivered applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identity and Endpoint: With staff working remotely, corporate applications are being accessed from laptops and other mobile devices outside of the traditional enterprise perimeter. As a result, identity and endpoint-based security are replacing perimeter-based security strategies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Social and Digital: Enterprises increasingly utilize social media channels and web properties that can be spoofed or compromised.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Privacy: According to a 2020 KPMG Survey, 87% of consumers say data privacy is a human right, and 91% say that companies should be held responsible for corporate data breaches. Massive data breaches continue to leave consumers vulnerable.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3 

  
• | Cryptocurrency and Blockchain: As cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies continue to become more mainstream, securing enterprise blockchain ecosystems and auditing smart contracts will become more important as institutions incorporate these technologies into critical business applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: New and unknown risks are inherent in our growing dependence on AI and machine learning technologies to make business decisions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industrial and IoT: Critical infrastructure, including energy, power and transportation, typically runs on legacy technology built for reliability and uptime, with little concern for cybersecurity. Exponential growth of internet-connected industrial sensors and devices has further exacerbated inherent vulnerabilities, thus driving the need for new ways to protect these environments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply Chain: Increasing digital connectivity with third-party vendors in the supply chain continues to represent significant vulnerability outside of the control of enterprise organizations that can be leveraged by attackers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Insider Threats: Insider threats continue to represent an insidious and difficult-to-detect attack vector even as the potential for reputational and economic damage increases as digital transformation takes hold.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drones: Drones are more prevalent in today’s society driven by innovative uses like home delivery, unmanned inspection of sites and equipment, and hobbies for drone enthusiasts. Equipped with cameras, GPS and USB ports, drones are increasingly incorporating more advanced features and are beginning to be used by adversaries—representing not only a significant cyber threat, but a physical one as well.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satellite: Space satellites are increasingly utilized by government and commercial organizations for mission-critical and business applications, including as a new means of communications and internet access. As the internet moves to space, a new attack vector will follow.

Collective Operating Expertise 
 Our team has over 150 years of cumulative experience building and operating iconic cybersecurity and software companies in private and public markets and has a deep understanding of operations, finance, mergers and acquisitions and talent acquisition. Our team has worked together at different points in time during our tenure at market-leading public companies including Cadence, Documentum, DellEMC, FireEye and McAfee. Based on our collective operating experience and proven track record, we believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the confluence of factors driving market growth and rapid technological innovation to support and advise the CSSP company with which we partner in becoming a next-generation market-leading public company. 
Business Combination Criteria 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines, we are seeking an initial business combination with a target business: 

• | where we can materially impact the value and growth of the company in partnership with management;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | where we can leverage networks of founders, operators, investors and advisors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | where we have a differentiated view on the ability of the target to create value as a public company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | where we can address a large market capitalizing on trends within the CSSP industry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that can serve as a platform for consolidation and growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | with a defensible market position and demonstrated advantages when compared to its competitors, and which creates barriers to entry against new competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | which is at an inflection point (such as requiring additional management expertise) or that is able to innovate through new operational techniques;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that is a fundamentally sound company and can leverage our expertise and relationships to achieve its full potential;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | which may be undergoing a transition to subscription or SaaS models;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | which is exhibiting unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy that we believe has been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that would offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders, potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure that would be weighed against any identified downside risks; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that could benefit from being a publicly traded company, could rapidly ramp its readiness to be a public company, and could utilize access to broader capital markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our management may deem relevant. If we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria, and guidelines, we would disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 
 
4 

  In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates would be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds, and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating prospective business combinations, we have conducted and will continue to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that encompasses, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We have utilized and will continue to utilize the expertise of our management team and advisors in analyzing companies in the CSSP industry and evaluating financial and operating projections and determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. Our initial business combination will be approved by a majority of independent and disinterested directors, and, in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of our independent directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view from an independent investment banking firm. We may take other appropriate steps consistent with Delaware law to address any potential conflicts of interest. 
 Our sponsor, our directors and members of our management team may directly or indirectly own shares of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock, warrants to purchase our Class A common stock or other equity-linked securities, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officer or director is made a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she would honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. 
 Our officers, directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or, in the case of individuals, serve as a director or officer of, other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such company may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflict would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our sponsor, directors, officers, and advisors have agreed not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our initial public offering, or 27 months from the closing of our initial public offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering.

Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 Financial Position 
 With funds available in the trust account for a business combination initially in the amount of $345,000,000, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
NightDragon Acquisition Corp. Investment Thesis 
 The CSSP market is a large, $131 billion addressable market. 
 As a result of a confluence of major factors, including technological innovation, lack of innovation from existing vendors, rise of financially and ideologically motivated adversaries, widely available markets for attacker tools, geopolitical tensions, increasing regulation, a dramatic shortage in security-related talent and the impact of COVID-19, there is an increasing demand and opportunity for CSSP companies to address these threats. 
 Members of the NightDragon Team have established and prolific track records operating iconic cybersecurity and software companies and generating significant value in the process. We will use our experience and our ecosystem of advisors and relationships in the CSSP industry to attract, advise, merge with and scale a next-generation, market-leading CSSP company. 
 Additionally, we expect our performance-based Stakeholder-Center Aligned Listed Equity, or SCALE, structure to attract high quality companies that share our philosophy of long-term alignment, enhance the potential for high returns, and strengthen the value proposition of NightDragon Acquisition Corp. for all stakeholders.

  The key elements of our structure are summarized below and are explained further elsewhere in this report. 
 

Conventional SPAC | NightDragon SCALE | NightDragon SCALE’s Advantages 
• Sponsor’s promote represents 20% of the common stock issued and outstanding • All founder shares vested, no performance-based test | • Promote consists of Class B common stock, representing approximately 20% of our shares of common stock outstanding, will vest in four equal tranches as described below • 25% of the Class B common stock will convert to shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of our initial business combination, with the remaining 75% converting in three equal tranches upon the achievement of Class A common stock price milestones of $12.00, $15.00 and $20.00 per share for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period following our initial business combination (but only prior to the 10 year anniversary of our initial business combination) • The Class B common stock will also convert to Class A common stock upon the consummation of a strategic transaction following our initial business combination if the effective price per share of Class A common stock is at least equal to $12.00 in such transaction • Any portion of the Class B common stock not converted before the 10th anniversary of our initial business combination will be automatically forfeited for no consideration | • Less dilution to the target business absent post-business combination share price performance • Downside and upside are shared with investors because our sponsor’s economics from the founder shares only fully reach the level of a conventional SPAC with 20% founder shares when the stock trades at or above $20.00 per share for the predetermined number of days or in connection with the consummation of certain strategic transactions following our initial business combination • Vesting thresholds create longer-term incentives 

Initial Business Combination 
 Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of the 80% of net assets test. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors would not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting

  securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 
 We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 Other Considerations 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. Our initial business combination will be approved by a majority of independent and disinterested directors, and, in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We may take other appropriate steps consistent with Delaware law to address any potential conflicts of interest. 
 Our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. 
 Corporate Information 
 Our executive offices are located at 101 Second Street, Suite 1275, San Francisco, California 94105 and our telephone number is (510) 306-7780. We maintain a corporate website at www.ndac.com. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this report. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following March 4, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the aggregate worldwide market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues equal or exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
