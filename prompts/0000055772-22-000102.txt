General Description of Business
Overview
Kimball International is a leading omnichannel commercial furnishings company with deep expertise in the Workplace, Health and Hospitality markets. We combine our bold entrepreneurial spirit, a history of craftsmanship, and today’s design-driven thinking alongside a commitment to our culture of caring and lasting connections with our customers, shareholders, employees and communities.

Recent Business Changes
Operating Environment
While inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions continued to increase production costs, higher volumes and the benefit of increased prices together with our ongoing cost-out initiatives positively impacted our fiscal year 2022 results. We continue to believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand, cash generated from operations, and the availability of borrowing under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other operating 
needs for at least the next twelve months. The following are key uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other operational impacts:
•Labor constraints - A shortage of manufacturing labor is a limiting factor for our production. In addition to limiting the volume of production, the labor shortage also may drive increased labor costs driven by both increased wages and overtime expenses. 
•Supply constraints - We are experiencing inflationary pressure on our materials coupled with supplier volatility as certain suppliers are also experiencing material and labor shortages. We are working to offset these issues through price increases on our products, supplier negotiations, global sourcing initiatives, make-versus-buy analyses, product re-engineering and parts standardization. To avoid future gross margin compression as we experience inflationary pressure on our manufacturing inputs, timely adjustments to customer prices may be necessary.
•Shipping disruptions - We expect to continue to be exposed to fluctuations in both domestic freight and ocean freight costs. Transportation costs are managed by optimizing logistics and supply chain planning, but the current freight rate levels are elevated such that significant year-over-year increases occurred during the second half of our fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 and are expected to remain elevated. We intend to adjust customer pricing, including the use of temporary surcharges, as necessary to mitigate increased freight costs.
•Return-to-office variation - Widespread variation in return-to-office policies and timelines across the nation continue to drive fluctuation in demand for our products. 
‘Kimball International Connect’ Strategy
In May 2019, Kimball International introduced a comprehensive strategy to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth and unlock the Company’s full potential. Kimball International Connect seeks to enable the power of our people and position our organization to engage at higher levels of collaboration and interdependence. 
Our Kimball International Connect Strategy is comprised of four pillars:
▪Inspire Our People: Leveraging our legacy of a bold and entrepreneurial spirit, we are working to cultivate a high-performance, caring culture. We are investing in our training, technology and systems to remain an employer of choice and a great place to work.
▪Build Our Capabilities: We created center-led functions, including finance, human resources, information technology and legal and centralized supply chain leadership to reduce duplication, deliver efficiencies, and drive consistency. We are also adopting new ways of working to ensure the use of common best practices and approaches. 
▪Fuel Our Future: We are driving lean throughout the organization, removing duplication at the business level, and infusing capital to accelerate efficiencies. Related to this, we are employing a more metrics-based approach and driving toward more formal standardized operating practices. 
▪Accelerate Our Growth: We are continuing to advance new product development across our brands, selectively expanding our verticals and channels, including health and e-commerce, and driving commercial excellence. We believe by being our customers’ first choice for shaping places that bring collaboration, discovery, wellness and relaxation to life, we will capture greater market share. 
‘Kimball International Connect 2.0’ Strategy
In August 2020, Kimball International announced Connect 2.0, which centers around accelerating our growth. The four pillars of our previously announced strategy remain constant: inspire our people with a purpose driven and high-performance culture, build our capabilities by expanding our work on innovation, fuel our future through the dedication to cost savings, and accelerate our growth. Connect 2.0 is designed to accelerate the growth of Kimball International and enable us to effectively manage through the current economic downturn, by driving market share gains as well as yielding additional cost savings. The Company has been reorganized into four market centric business units which are Workplace, Health, Hospitality, and eBusiness that will accelerate our ability to redesign and reimagine the new workplace, build a new work from home portfolio, continue assembling experts in health, and expand our hospitality business into other commercial direct sales environments. The dedicated eBusiness unit will take a leadership role in establishing all e-commerce across our brands and end markets. Each of these four business units will be supported by the agility and efficiency of Global Operations and the streamlined center-led structure that we implemented in year one of our strategy and the transformation restructuring plan described below. 
Transformation Restructuring Plan
In August 2020, we announced the second phase of our transformation restructuring plan that will align our business units to a new market-centric orientation and is expected to yield additional cost savings that will aid us to effectively manage through the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current phase of the transformation restructuring plan builds on the initial strategy and the first phase of our transformation restructuring plan announced in June 2019 and substantially completed as of June 30, 2021. We expect a substantial majority of the underlying activities of these aforementioned actions to be completed by the end of our fiscal year 2023. The following is a summary of the activities we are undertaking pursuant to phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan:
•As part of the previously announced plan to consolidate manufacturing of all brands into one world-class global operations group, we are streamlining our manufacturing facilities by leveraging production capabilities across all facilities, establishing centers of excellence, and setting up processes to facilitate flexing of product between facilities in response to volume fluctuations. We are also reviewing our overall facility footprint to identify opportunities to reduce capacity and gain efficiencies, including the consolidation of our Baltimore, Maryland facility into other manufacturing facilities and the closure of our leased Tijuana, Mexico hospitality product manufacturing facility and Chula Vista, California warehouse.
•We streamlined our workforce to align with the new organizational structure and lower volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a more efficient organization to deliver on our Connect 2.0 strategy. During fiscal year 2021, we offered two voluntary retirement incentive programs to eligible employees. 
•During fiscal year 2022, many of our showrooms have been revamped to now feature our family of brands thus eliminating the need for multiple showrooms in the same city. 
Acquisition of Poppin, Inc.
On December 9, 2020, we acquired Poppin, a tech-enabled, market-leading B2B commercial furniture design company headquartered in New York City, New York. Poppin designs commercial-grade furniture that is made to mix, match, and scale in today’s modern office and work-from-home environments.

A table showing our net sales by end market is included in Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Major Competitive Factors
Our products are sold in the contract furniture and hospitality furniture industries. These industries have similar major competitive factors, which include price in relation to quality and appearance, product design, the utility of the product, 
including adaptability and cleanability, supplier lead time, reliability of on-time delivery, sustainability, and the ability to respond to requests for special and non-standard products. We offer payment terms similar to industry standards and in unique circumstances may grant alternate payment terms.
Certain industries are more price sensitive than others, but all expect on-time, damage-free delivery. In addition to the many options available on our standard furniture products, custom furniture is produced to customer specifications and shipping timelines on a project basis. We offer several programs that include furniture for a variety of spaces with quick-ship options.
Competitors
There are numerous furniture manufacturers competing within the marketplace, with a significant number of competitors offering similar products. Our competition includes furniture manufacturers such as Steelcase Inc., MillerKnoll, Inc., HNI Corporation, and a large number of smaller privately-owned furniture manufacturers, both domestic and foreign-based.
Product Development and Trends
Our robust product development process is comprised of ideation, development, and execution. Research informed design is accomplished through partnering with external research firms and utilizing internal and external design intelligence to gain market insights and obtain design validation. Successful new product introductions fuel the growth of our business as they incorporate evolving customer needs with improved manufacturing efficiencies. Products are tested for performance, quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations. We invested approximately $11 million, $10 million, and $5 million in research and development related activities in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In addition, we periodically pay royalties to external designers as select products are sold.
Our product designs focus on providing solutions which include addressing trends in the marketplace, such as the evolving flexible workplace environment. Key elements of the evolving flexible workplace include pairing residential elements with highly functional and flexible commercial office offerings that have high cleanability. Within healthcare settings, products are trending toward adaptable designs that are focused on both the patients and the caregivers with a continued focus on cleanability.
Locations
As of June 30, 2022, our products were primarily produced at nine Company-owned or leased manufacturing facilities: six located in Indiana, two in Kentucky, and one in Mexico. We also engage with third-party manufacturers within the U.S. as well as internationally to produce select finished goods and accessories for our brands. As part of our transformation restructuring plan, our leased office and warehouse space in Chula Vista, California and manufacturing and office space in Tijuana Mexico will be exited during fiscal year 2023 as we plan to primarily outsource the D’Style product.
As of June 30, 2022, fifteen furniture showrooms were maintained in nine cities in the United States inclusive of the standalone Poppin showrooms. During fiscal year 2022 we implemented a showroom strategy where we highlight our Kimball, National, Etc., Poppin, and Interwoven brands in shared showroom spaces which eliminates having multiple showrooms in a single city. Office space is leased in Dongguan and Shenzen, both located in the province of Guangdong, China and office space in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to facilitate sourcing of select finished goods and components from the Asia Pacific Region. 
Financial information by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022 is included in Note 18 - Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
Resources
Raw Material Availability
Certain components used in the production of furniture are manufactured internally and are generally readily available, as are other raw materials used in the production of wood and non-wood furniture. Certain fabricated seating components, wood frame assemblies as well as finished furniture products, electrical components, stone, fabrics, and fabricated metal components, which are generally readily available, are sourced on a global scale in an effort to provide quality products at the lowest total cost. We are experiencing inflationary pressure on our materials coupled with supplier volatility as certain suppliers are also experiencing material and labor shortages. We are working to offset these issues through price increases on our products, supplier negotiations, global sourcing initiatives, product re-engineering and parts standardization.
Working Capital
We do not believe that we, or the contract furniture or hospitality furniture industries in general, have any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding our furniture business. We do receive advance payments from customers on select furniture projects, primarily in the hospitality industry.
Intellectual Property
In connection with our business operations, we hold both trademarks and patents in various countries and continuously have additional pending trademarks and patents. The intellectual property which we believe to be the most significant to the Company includes: Kimball, National, D’style, David Edward, Etc. (pending), Poppin, Interwoven (pending), EverySpace, Fringe, Waveworks, Xsite, Narrate, Pairings, Respitality, Work Happy, and Allan Copley Designs, which are all registered trademarks, and the unregistered trademarks Priority and Whittaker. Our patents expire at various times depending on the patent’s date of issuance. 
Seasonality
The impact of seasonality on our revenue includes lower sales to educational institutions during our second and third fiscal quarters, lower sales of hospitality furniture during times of high hotel occupancy such as the summer months, and lower sales in our third fiscal quarter due to the buying season of the government.
Human Capital
Strategic Workforce Planning
Attracting and retaining talent is a high priority. By understanding current workforce realities, anticipating future needs and issues, and executing tactics and actions, we strive to provide an engaged, sustainable manufacturing and professional workforce in an increasingly competitive market.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
We recognize that diverse, talented and engaged employees are a key competitive advantage. We promote an environment where each employee is valued, respected, and treated with dignity. We believe a wide array of perspectives, resulting from a diverse culture, promote innovation and build success.
Kimball International is an Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer. We have established policies to promote diversity and non-discriminatory employment practices. We believe that the best policy is one that awards a job to the most qualified person. Kimball International does not discriminate in its employment policies and practices on the basis of age, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender, disability, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, status as a protected veteran, or any other legally-protected status. Kimball International is committed to hiring qualified applicants and providing employees with disabilities with reasonable accommodations that do not impose undue hardship.
Talent Development 
We are committed to employee and leadership development. Our flagship senior leadership program provides leadership development through coaching, assessments, and experiential action learning projects with direct mentoring from our CEO. We offer a frontline leadership program for emerging managers and leadership roundtables. We also support employee participation in training programs and mentoring programs.
Compensation, Benefits, and Wellness
The goals of our compensation philosophy are to reward performance, align with shareholders’ interest, and retain key talent. We offer employee participation in a defined contribution 401(k) plan through our Kimball International Retirement Plan. We offer comprehensive benefits to our U.S. full-time employees, including healthcare, pharmacy, a health savings account, an employee assistance program, dental, vision, short-term and long-term disability insurance, life and dependent insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, critical illness insurance, accident, and hospital indemnity insurance. We also have a health clinic in Indiana which offers on-site and telehealth appointments for employees and dependents. 

Employee Counts | As of June 30
 | 2022 | 2021
United States | 2,310 | | 2,093
Foreign Countries | 100 | | 103 
Total Employees | 2,410 | | 2,196

Our U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Outside of the U.S., approximately 40 employees are represented by worker’s unions that operate to promote the interests of workers. We believe that our employee relations are good.

Employee Turnover | Year Ended June 30
 | 2022 | | 2021
Voluntary | 39.4 | % | | 27.5 | %
Involuntary | 10.2 | % | | 7.7 | %
Health/Retirement | 7.1 | % | | 6.0 | %
Total Turnover % | 56.7 | % | | 41.2 | %

We monitor voluntary and involuntary turnover independently on a month-to-month basis, taking actions where we see rates exceed our established targets. Our increase in voluntary turnover is consistent with manufacturing organizations in similar industries, especially the manufacturing workforce due to low unemployment rates and competitive employment options in the rural communities near our manufacturing facilities.
Environment and Energy Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no material liabilities related to such items.
We are committed to conducting business operations in ways that minimize our environmental footprint and use of natural resources while positively impacting the communities we serve. Protecting our natural resources and utilizing environmentally responsible business practices have long been key components of our corporate purpose. Reinforcing our commitment to the environment, two of our showrooms and one non-manufacturing location were designed under the guidelines of the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for Commercial Interiors program. Our headquarters received the WELL Health-Safety Rating that focuses on operational policies, maintenance protocols, emergency plans and shareholder engagement strategies.
We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, which have been enacted relating to the protection of the environment, will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We believe capital expenditures for environmental control equipment during the current fiscal year and subsequent fiscal years will not represent a material portion of total capital expenditures.
