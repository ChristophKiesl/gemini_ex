Item 1. Business
Background
 
Business Overview
 
Coordinates Collection, Inc. (“CCI”), previously known as FD9 Group, Inc., markets and distributes classic custom jewelry through Le Bloc and custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life's special moments through Coordinates Collection. CCI was organized as a Delaware corporation in 2013 and is currently based in Los Angeles, California.
 
On December 1, 2016, substantially all of the operating assets of CCI was acquired by Reign Corporation (“RGNP”), formerly known as Reign Sapphire Corporation, (see “Acquisition of Assets Related to the Coordinates Collection Business”). RGNP is a Beverly Hills-based, direct-to-consumer, branded and custom jewelry company. As part of the Acquisition, we created a wholly owned subsidiary, Reign Brands, Inc. (“Reign Brands”), which is a Delaware corporation, and shall act as the operating entity for the acquired CCI assets.
 
Subsequent to the acquisition of CCI’s assets, we have three niche brands: Reign Sapphire: ethically produced, direct mine-to-consumer sapphire jewelry targeting millennials, Coordinates Collection: custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life's special moments, and Le Bloc: classic customized jewelry.

Reign Sapphire
 
Reign Sapphire was established as a vertically integrated “source to retail” model for sapphires—rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires. We are not an exploration or mining company and are not engaged in exploration or mining activities. We purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from commercial miners in Australia, and we intend to oversee each step of the process as the stones go from the miners-gate to the consumer as Reign Sapphire jewelry.
 
Our core values are to offer consumers conflict free sapphires; sapphires that are mined from a verified source; sapphires that have been procured directly from miners, sapphires that are ethically processed and sapphires that are natural (not synthetic). In addition, we intend to feature exclusively Australian sapphires in our jewelry collections.
 
Coordinates Collection
 
Coordinates Collection markets and distributes custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life's special moments. Coordinates Collection is the next level of customized jewelry that pairs high quality craftsmanship with a fresh look. Geographic coordinates pinpoint the location of a favorite memory and the beautiful engraving personalizes each piece to the customer. Coordinates Collection uses high quality materials such as semi-precious to precious metals and stones as well as ceramic coatings. All products take personalization to the next level with stylish, high quality hand-crafted products, a customized experience and a unique technology platform that guides the customer through a step-by-step process to create the perfect meaningful piece.
Le Bloc
 
Le Bloc markets and distributes classic custom jewelry. Le Bloc is a way to wear your favorite letters and/or words. The collection is comprised of bracelets, necklaces, and rings featuring bloc’s engraved with a single letter in the finish of your choice.
Acquisition of Assets Related to the Coordinates Collection Business
 
On December 1, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of CCI (the "Acquisition"). CCI is engaged in the marketing and distribution of Coordinates Collection and Le Bloc customized jewelry. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, we received substantially all of the operating assets of CCI, consisting of fixed assets and intellectual property. As part of the Acquisition, we created a wholly owned subsidiary, Reign Brands, which is a Delaware corporation, and shall act as the operating entity for the acquired CCI assets.

With the acquisition of the Coordinates Collection and Le Bloc brands, we plan to leverage our custom jewelry expertise to expand distribution worldwide.
 
The purchase price of the operating assets of CCI was the issuance 7,000,000 shares of common stock (of which 1,000,000 shares were issued to ASK Gold, a major supplier) valued at $770,000 (based on our stock price on the date of issuance). In addition, there is a cash payment of $500,000 contingent upon a future offering and earn out payments for all sales of CCI and RGNP products sold via CCI sales channels for the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 calendar years. The estimated fair value of the contingent payments totaled $424,511 and was recognized as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 (Successor). We accounted for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting was used to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company. Such accounting generally results in increased amortization and depreciation reported in future periods. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor and the Company are not comparable in all material respects since those consolidated financial statements report financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of these two separate entities. CCI's fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired were recorded based upon their estimated fair values as of the closing date of the Acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
 

Total Purchase Consideration: | | 
--------------------------------------------+---+----------
Common stock issued | $ | 770,000 
Estimated fair value of contingent payments | | 424,511 
 | $ | 1,194,511

 
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired as of the date of Acquisition:
 

Net assets acquired: | | 
----------------------------------------+---+----------
Equipment | $ | 32,564 
Developed technology - website | | 117,500 
Developed technology – Ipad application | | 117,500 
Tradename | | 365,000 
Proprietary design | | 80,000 
Goodwill | | 481,947 
 | $ | 1,194,511

 
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present.
 
Strategy
 
Reign Sapphire 
 
We intend to set ourselves apart from our competition by actively promoting our three core offerings: a vertically integrated “source to retail” model for sapphires - rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires.
 
We intend to promote Reign Sapphires as conflict free, ethically processed and natural. We also intend to make video footage and pictures of the process available to consumers.
 
We intend to focus primarily on quality and design and secondly on strategic pricing methods in order to compete in the U.S. market.

While all of our competitors have established themselves uniquely within sectors of the market, none have marketed themselves as mine-gate to consumers with a vertical integration of processing, cutting and shaping, manufacturing, and sales of sapphires. We believe there is a strong market opportunity for our products as there is currently growth in U.S. and global jewelry sales. We believe that we have the knowledge and expertise to capitalize on this opportunity and to capitalize upon the uniquely powerful internationally recognized Australian brand image and appeal and become the leading player in this fragmented cottage industry.
 
Coordinates Collection and Le Bloc
 
We market our Coordinates Collection and Le Bloc products using various strategies including social media, independent affiliates, Internet advertising, wholesale relationships, and “word of mouth” free advertising.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have an exclusive international distribution agreement with a third party marketing company to distribute the Reign Brands, Coordinates Collection and Le Bloc products in the country of Qatar at discounted prices. The agreement is for a term of five years and terminates in July 2021.
 
We have no intentions or plans to merge with an unidentified company.
 
Products 
 
Our initial product lines will consist of rings, bracelets, necklaces. We intend to eventually manufacture pendants and watches. When sapphires are used in the products, they are predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut melees.
 
Aspects of processing, manufacturing and sales: 
 

· | Gem Shaping, Cutting, & Processing for our Reign Sapphire products: Our contract gem design team cut, shape, and process rough sapphire material into gem stones.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Jewelry Manufacturing: We have outsourced the manufacturing to a quality U.S. provider.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Packaging: Each jewelry item is accompanied by a high quality, durable jewelry box, gift bag, certificate of authenticity and warranty.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our Reign Sapphire products feature sapphires that have been procured in the rough from commercial miners in New South Wales, Australia and processed by us. We do not have an exclusive supplier rather a number of commercial miners in the region that have been supplying the company with run-of-mine material for a number of years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not rely on any principal suppliers and do not have any formal contracts with our suppliers. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available to us and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.
 
Market Overview
 
Opportunities
 
Demand for the industry’s products is largely driven by the needs and preferences of consumers, along with variations in the level of disposable income allocated toward their purchases. We intend to launch a high-end his and hers’ jewelry line that uses fine blue pave sapphires, as well as an extremely high-end couture brand that uses the finest sapphires available from our Australian miners, cut by expert cutters, and set in fine custom jewelry.
 
The primary audience for the brand is women - they are the market, in general. However, while women may make the choices, men often oversee the purchase. Speaking to both women and men will be an important aspect of any program. There are 3 main stages of life where a jewelry purchase will come into play:
 

· | Single “The Self Purchaser” (I Love Being Me)
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Married (Engagement/Wedding/Children - Push Present)
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | Retired (Gift Giver)
--+---------------------

 
More specific age segmentation within these life stages includes:
 

· | 18-25 coming of age/first job
--+------------------------------


· | 25-35 career development/children
--+----------------------------------


6
-


· | 35-45 family/career advancement (self-purchaser)
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | 45-55 self-actualization/empty nest (gift giver to self and others)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
An example of women’s networks and influencers include:
 

· | Friends (word-of-mouth)
--+------------------------


· | Celebrities (aspirational)
--+---------------------------


· | Bloggers/online platforms (trusted network)
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Media (3rd party endorsement)
--+------------------------------


· | Peers in business
--+------------------

 
Understanding how the various targets receive information and are influenced in making jewelry purchases helps direct various streams of communication.
 
Because of the flexibility inherent in its model, we can adjust our brand voice specifically to reach a variety of women and men desiring a sapphire option in fine jewelry. The ability to promote the mine-gate to retail model should separate the brand from our competitors.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Marketing Overview & Strategy
 
We are focusing our marketing initiatives on: (1) Direct-to-Consumer (“D2C”) ecommerce marketing to attract customers to the reignsc.com website, (2) Business-to-Business (“B2B”) marketing and sales efforts, to establish distribution partners such as high-end fashion retailers, and eventually (3) building a strong retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level. We are initially focusing our marketing efforts in the U.S. with online, wholesale, and retail sales, and then intend to expand our marketing internationally.
 
On a D2C basis, we use an array of marketing methods to spread awareness of our jewelry products, including a mobile app, social media, internet marketing, print advertising, promotions, and eventually signage. We intend to identify ideal locations that will contain a lot of walk-by traffic in communities with middle to upper income residents.
 
We will continue to form limited wholesale partnerships with retailers to sell our products at their retail boutiques, the benefit to us is the promotion of our brands at the consumer level until we are in a position to open our own flagship stores. Prior to launching our sales campaign, we intend to develop and use association strategy to identify appropriate and strategic partners for co-marketing opportunities.
 
Branding Strategy
 
Branding will play a critical role in our success. We have performed a capabilities audit and have developed and designed the products.
 
We have also performed marketing and capabilities landscape assessments based upon consumer immersion and research and designed to understand consumer purchase behaviors and values, assess short and long term socio-cultural and market trends, and analyze the marketplace and competitive landscape. We have collaborated with an assembled team of experts in the naming and development of the brand using expert level product design and marketing strategy. We have designed the look and feel of the logo using a palette, style guide, inspiration boards, design renderings, and production images.
 
We have developed a comprehensive, consumer-oriented toolkit using consistent language and tone for printed and online media and to target retailers on a sell-in, exclusive basis.
 
We intend to develop advertisements for print and online media, and sales materials for retail strategic partners. We intend to maintain a graphics library to be used on all touch points.

Social Media
 
Our marketing team is working on several social media initiatives that target current and future consumers and support the promotion and sale of our product brands. Our campaigns are focused on driving a consistent message emphasizing the ethical origins of our products, their everlasting beauty, and overall value. We are using various forms of digital and social media outreach to accomplish greater awareness of the value proposition we offer.
Internet Marketing
 
We intend to establish a presence on Google, Yelp, Bing, Yahoo and all other online search engines that are used to search for jewelry and sapphires. We intend to engage in significant search engine optimization marketing efforts to ensure that we have strong results upon natural searches related to jewelry and sapphires. We intend to utilize pay per click advertising, display advertising, and article marketing. Our website will display a full catalogue of its products, background information regarding the mining of the products, information about the Company and management team, and contact information. We will also maintain a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites to have an interactive presence.
Strategic Partnerships with Retailers
 
We intend to form limited strategic partnerships with retailers to sell the products at their retail boutiques. The benefit to us is the promotion of our brand at the consumer level until we are in a position to open our own flagship stores. Prior to launching our sales campaign, we intend to develop and use association strategy to identify appropriate and strategic partners for co-marketing opportunities.
 
We intend to develop a retail channel strategy to bolster the retail/direct to consumer sales approach while maintain a point of differentiation within the competitive landscape. Furthermore, we intend to develop retail adaptation strategies using in-store promotional and retail tactics using our branding strategy.
 
Print Advertising
 
We intend to advertise in lifestyle and fashion magazines that cater to middle to upper income individuals, such as Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Vanity Fair.
 
Public Relations
 
We intend to gain public awareness and gain credibility through a public relations (“PR”) campaign to establish relationships with the local market. We intend to consistently attend editor events and engage in strategic media outreach planning and become a valued member of the community through community service offerings and support. We have engaged a PR firm to work to obtain interviews, print articles, and featured spots in leading fashion, luxury, and bridal magazines, industry publications, television news, radio programming, periodicals, and online websites and publications. We intend to develop short-lead and long-lead editorials and long lead editorials. The purpose of the PR campaign is to highlight the strength and innovation of our products.
Sponsorships
 
We intend to sponsor social events that are appropriate to promote jewelry on a consumer level. Examples of such events could be parties, art or photo shows, and charity events.
Celebrity Endorsement
 
We intend to continue to identify multiple celebrities to bolster the brand image, and spread awareness of our brand and products.
 
Promotions
 
We intend to develop promotional platforms to include sales during and after holidays, discounted prices on particular products, and discounts for repeat customers.

Seasonality
 
Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the holiday season. Our sales to support the holiday season largely have taken place during the fourth calendar quarter; however, the effect of seasonality on our business is also impacted by the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution. In future periods, as sales increase to retailers and directly to consumers, both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales, we anticipate that these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.
Competition
 
Competitive Analysis and Strategy
 
The industry in which we compete is highly competitive. We believe that the most important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to control as much as possible of the supply chain.
 
We intend to position ourselves as a premium brand in the price point and company of competitors such as Cartier; Harry Winston; Roberto Coin; Van Cleef & Arpels and Bvlgari. We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong ecommerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust & recognition. However, we intend to set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.
 
Because we are a small company with a limited operating history, we are at a competitive disadvantage against larger and well-capitalized companies which have a track record of success and operations. Therefore, our primary method of competition involves promoting our direct to consumer offering.
 
We do not intend to sell rough sapphires neither do we intend to sell the cut stones that we process; we intend to use the material exclusively for our manufacturing purposes. Wholesale revenues currently derived from sales of loose sapphires are attributable only to finished stones and not rough sapphires and the focus of our sales efforts in the future will be exclusively on finished jewelry.
 
In addition, although we will endeavor to secure wholesale partners, we intend to only offer a limited collection and inventory to our wholesale partners and intend to retain as much inventory as possible for own ecommerce site and flagship store.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Reign owns trademarks in the jewelry and gemstone class including “Reign”, “Reign Opulence”, “LeBloc”, “Coordinates Collection”, and “Ion Collection”, and we also own a number of domain names.
Governmental Approvals and Regulation
 
We do not require any government approval in order to operate our business. In the event any of our operations or products requires government approval, we will comply with any and all local, state and federal requirements.
 
Other than federal and state securities laws and common business and tax rules and regulations, we are not subject to any material government regulation. However, there is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
We are currently in violation of Item 2.01 and Item 9.01 of Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which required us to file financial statements of CCI on Form 8-K no later than 71 days from the closing date of the December 1, 2016 acquisition. We intend to correct this violation by filing the required Form 8-K.

Procurement and Manufacturing
 
At the present time, all of our manufacturing is conducted in the U.S. We have no formal contracts with our suppliers and manufacturers. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers or manufacturers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available to us and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.
Research and Development
 
Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. In the event opportunities arise from our operations, we may elect to initiate research and development activities, but we have no plans for any activities to date.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations are not subject to any environmental laws or regulations.
 
Employees
 
The Company had 10 full-time employees and no part-time employees as of the date of this filing.
 
We have an employer contribution for health but we do not provide pension, annuity, insurance, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future.
Available Information
 
We file various reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are available through the SEC's electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval system (“EDGAR”) by accessing the SEC's home page (http://www.sec.gov).
