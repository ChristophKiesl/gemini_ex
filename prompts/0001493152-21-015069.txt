Markets
 
Madison’s sale strategy is to create a sophisticated social media marketing operation that employs online marketing strategies developed by Facebook, Instagram and YouTube to track the behavior of potential customers that are most likely to buy specific products based of their previous and recent purchases.
 
The operation will also utilize retargeting techniques that place promotional video marketing ads on the news feed of potential customers in real time that have done searches for particular products that align with the ones we are selling.
 
The creative/marketing team will maintain ongoing market analysis with a key focus on market differentiation. From the onset, they will create a “Casa Zeta-Jones Marketing Roadmap” including everything from software and branding, ecommerce website, loyalty program and email automation to marketing tactics execution and marketing-as-a-service.
 
Madison will also engage brand influencers and top social media personas in an aggressive strategy to use the power of their social networks to help build and maintain the shave club membership base.
 
Distribution Methods
 
Madison distribution method is to deliver the products worldwide via an online sign up process through an e-commerce website. The website will use a subscription based revenue model, and will offer a tier system for subscriptions. Customers will be a able to select from luxury products selected exclusively by Catherne Zeta-Jones.
 
Once an order is received Madison will outsource the packaging and delivery to fulfillment providers services including but not limited to The Jay Group, ModusLink and Echodata.

Management expects to expand Madison’s sales distribution strategy beginning in May 2021 and to be operational by November 2021, this includes the following components:
 
1. Initial inventory with an estimated cost of $600,000
 
2. Social media and online advertising of $50,000
 
Status of Licensed Products
 
The Luxerie Legs Products razor handle will be supplied by Shick Edgewell, and the creams will be formulated by a independent formulation laboratory . Madison is currently working with several laboratories to perfect the cream products. Madison anticipates establishing a supply chain that is able to supply up to 200,000 units on an initial order. Management believes this initial order of Luxurie Legs Products will be sufficient for Madison’s anticipated inventory requirements for the first six months.
Competitive Conditions
 
Madison will be competing with other online retail companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than Madison in connection with the sale of similar products. Many of the competitors have a very diverse portfolio and have not confined their market to one product or line of products, but offer a wide array of products. All of these competitors have been in business for longer than Madison and may have established more strategic partnerships and relationships than Madison.
 
Management believes that it will have a competitive advantage over its competitors due to its plan of operations.
 
Madison has identified numerous competitors in the women’s shaving market products segment, from a variety of online merchants, and although most offer products similar or the same as Madison, management believes Madison will have a competitive advantage in the ability to fill orders and deliver the Luxurie Legs Products to its customers building on Catherine Zeta-Jones fame and followership to rapidly draw market attention which will develop buyer loyalty.
 
Madison has also identified several online retailers that supply products that management believes would be in direct competition with Madison’s business. Some of those competitors include, but not limited to, the following:
 

● | All Girl Shave Club - an online based supplier of high quality, female focused unique shaving and body products, delivered on a bi-monthly subscription model. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Oui the People- an online based supplier of premium shaving related products built around a proprietary safety razor focused on the female consumer . 
● | Billie - an online supplier women’s shaving and beauty products through a 1, 2 or 3 month reoccuring ordering model.

Sovryn Holdings, Inc.
 
On February 16, 2021, Madison Technologies Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Sovryn Holdings, Inc. (“Sovryn”) and the holders (the “Sovryn Shareholders”) of Sovryn’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
Product and Services
 
Through Sovryn Holdings, Inc., Madison has embarked on an acquisition strategy, rolling-up un-affiliated Class A/LPTV TV stations in the top 100 DMA’s (Designated Market Areas) with a goal of building out a nationwide platform through one or more station acquisitions per DMA. Each licensed TV station can broadcast between 10 and 12 and potentially more revenue “streams” of content (“channels”) over-the-air, 24 hours per day/7 days per week. Management’s strategy is to stage the acquisitions focusing on DMA’s 1-30 and expanding thereafter on DMA’s 31-100, acquiring one station per DMA and building a portfolio of 100 stations within 18-24 months. Management has currently identified and held discussions with a number stations owners, has received FCC approval for the acquisition of KNLA/KNET, a revenue producing Class A television station with coverage of 16mm people in the number 2 DMA in the U.S., Los Angeles, signed letters of intent with 3 other stations in the top 20 and verbal agreements on another 11 key, cash flowing stations in the top 30 markets.
 
Madison’s objective is to create one the largest, most comprehensive, state of the art, broadcast Over-The-Air (“OTA”) content distribution platforms to capitalize on the changing media and distribution landscape and on the growing OTA viewership in the U.S. The over-the-air programming carried on these stations is initially expected to include entertainment, shopping, weather, sports as well as religious networks and networks targeting select ethnic groups with content lease agreements as the prime source of revenue. Pricing of lease agreements is in part determined by market rank, the signal contour and the number of OTA TV households in a given market, as well as supply and demand.
 
As the platform is built out, management not only anticipates substantial operational synergies from the roll-up but also an expansion in the revenue base with greater channel utilization and the addition of high-quality third-party content providers that are currently not reaching the “OTA” viewers, which now stands at an estimated 20mm households (44mm people) out of 108mm TV HH’s nationwide.
 
Station Operations
 
Madison’s plan is to acquire 50 independent TV stations in the top 30 DMA’s over the next 6-12 months. In addition, Madison expects to grow the station base to 100 tv stations nationwide through additional acquisitions targeting the top 100 DMA’s across the nation, ultimately covering 80% of the population of the U.S. over the next 18-24 months.
 
Each licensed TV station has the capability of delivering 10+ different revenue “streams” (channels) of content Over-the-Air, 24 hours per day/7 days per week . If converted to the new FCC approved ATSC 3.0 technology, the streaming capacity will increase to 25+ channels or more, giving Sovryn the potential to stream content upon completion of the roll-up to over 2500 channels aggregated over expected 100 stations.
 
Madison will operate the stations remotely and centrally, eliminating the need for in-market personnel or a studio facility. Remote operations of stations results in significant cost efficiencies. Recent FCC deregulation in TV broadcasting has eliminated the need for full time employees and studio facilities operating Class A and Low Power stations allowing for greater cost efficiency.
 
New Broadcast TV Technology
 
In 2017, the FCC approved ATSC 3.0 technology, a next generation broadcast platform that will bring new revenue opportunities to broadcast television. ATSC 3.0 is an enhancement to the previous standard, providing new opportunities such as increased capacity, mobility and addressability allowing for customizable content, viewer measurability, target advertising and internet connectivity. All these features and more will be available on mobile devices allowing for broadcast operators to capitalize on audiences traditionally reserved for telecom operators.
Competitive Conditions
 
Madison’s broadcast stations will face competition from other free over-the-air television and radio stations, telecommunication companies, cable and satellite providers, print media providers, internet and other emerging technologies. Some of the company’s current and potential competitors have greater resources and access to capital. If Madison needs to obtain additional funding, the company may be not be able to obtain such capital on favorable terms and be forced to delay its development as a result. Furthermore, technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives may increase competition for household audiences.
