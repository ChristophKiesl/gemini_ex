ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
We are the world’s leading cloud software company powering social good. We combine software, services, data intelligence and expertise to help nonprofits, foundations, education institutions, corporations and individual change agents advance their missions. Blackbaud brings more than three decades of software and services leadership to the sector, offering a full spectrum of cloud and on-premise solutions, as well as a resource network that empowers and connects organizations of all sizes. Since originally incorporating in New York in 1981, later reincorporating as a South Carolina corporation in 1991 and a Delaware corporation in 2004, our portfolio of software and services has grown to support nonprofit fundraising and relationship management, digital marketing, advocacy, accounting, payments and analytics, as well as grant management, corporate social responsibility, and education. Our solutions are designed to meet the needs of virtually all types of nonprofit and charitable giving, from major global institutions to local soup kitchens. With recent acquisitions, we have expanded our addressable market to include institutions involved with the entire spectrum of giving activities, such as nonprofits, K-12 private and higher education institutions, faith-based organizations, healthcare organizations, foundations, and other charitable giving entities and corporations. Organizations that use Blackbaud technology raise, invest, manage and award more than $100 billion each year. At the end of 2016, we had approximately 35,000 customers located in over 60 countries using our solutions. We are deeply proud to play a part in our customers’ success in their missions to cure diseases, advance education, preserve and share arts and culture, help animals, support those in need and more.
Market Overview
The philanthropic industry is significant and our addressable market is substantial and growing
There were approximately 1.6 million U.S. nonprofit organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service in 2016, including approximately 1.1 million charitable 501(c)(3) organizations. Worldwide, there are millions more charities. The nonprofit market represents the third largest workforce category in the U.S. behind retail and manufacturing, representing 10% of total employment in the United States. According to Giving USA, donations made to U.S. nonprofit organizations in 2015 were $373.3 billion, amounting to 2.1% of U.S. GDP, a 4.1% increase from 2014. The average annual rate of change in total giving dollars over the last 40 years was 6.7%.
Our estimated current total addressable market ("TAM") is $6.7 billion. This includes an expansion in 2015 from our acquisition of Smart, LLC ("Smart Tuition") into K-12 tuition and financial aid management, which is a new and near adjacency within the education market. The total market expansion created by our acquisitions of Smart Tuition, WhippleHill Communications, Inc. (“WhippleHill”) and MicroEdge Holdings, LLC (“MicroEdge”) is estimated to be in excess of $1.5 billion.
Traditional methods of fundraising are often costly and inefficient
Many nonprofits use manual methods or stand-alone software applications not specifically designed to manage fundraising. Such methods are often costly and inefficient because of the difficulties in effectively collecting, sharing, and using donation-related information. Furthermore, general purpose software applications frequently have limited functionality and do not efficiently integrate multiple databases. Some nonprofit organizations have developed proprietary software, but doing so is expensive, requiring on-site technical personnel for development, implementation and maintenance. 
The nonprofit industry faces particular operational challenges
Nonprofit organizations must efficiently:

• | Solicit funds and build relationships with major donors;


2016 Form 10-K | 3

Blackbaud, Inc.


• | Garner small cash contributions from numerous contributors;


• | Manage and develop complex relationships with large numbers of constituents;


• | Communicate their accomplishments and the importance of their mission online and offline;


• | Comply with complex accounting, tax and reporting requirements that differ from those for traditional businesses;


• | Solicit cash and in-kind contributions from businesses to help raise money or deliver products and services;


• | Provide a wide array of programs and services to individual constituents; and


• | Improve the data collection and information sharing capabilities of their employees, volunteers and donors by creating and providing distributed access to centralized databases.

Because of these challenges, we believe nonprofit organizations can benefit from software applications and services specifically designed to serve their particular needs.
Corporations, grant making institutions and foundations also face unique challenges
The market segments addressed by our MicroEdge acquisition, which include corporations, grant making institutions and foundations, face their own unique challenges, including the need to:

• | Quantify and improve the impact of their grants;


• | Cultivate better relationships with grantees;


• | Achieve better internal collaboration and alignment with board members, reviewers, and other stakeholders;


• | Illustrate the impact of their corporate philanthropy efforts to the communities they serve;


• | Engage employees in meaningful volunteering, giving and other activities;


• | Ensure that their philanthropic efforts align with their business initiatives;


• | Manage all of a foundation's activities, including fundraising and accounting;


• | Expand the reach of their fundraising efforts; and


• | Cultivate new and existing donors.

Strategy
Our objective is to maintain and extend our position as a leading provider of software and services for the global social good community, supporting their missions from fundraising to outcomes. Our key strategies for achieving this objective are to:
Delight our customers
We intend to make our customers' experience with us effective, efficient and satisfying from their initial interest in our solutions and services, through their decision to purchase, engage with customer support and utilize solution enhancements. We continue to focus on initiatives aimed at improving the consistency and quality of user experience across the offerings we provide to our customers. We continue to evolve the manner in which we package and sell our offerings to provide high quality and value combined with flexibility to meet the different needs of our existing and prospective customers. For example, we have increased the number of our cloud solutions sold under a subscription pricing model, which can make it easier for customers to purchase our solutions. In addition, we are continuing to integrate value-adding capabilities such as payment processing, analytics and business intelligence into our suite of solutions to better address our customers' needs with comprehensive offerings. We will continue to focus on providing the highest level of solution support, enhancing our existing solutions and developing new solutions and services designed to help our customers to be more effective and achieve their missions.

Blackbaud, Inc.

Execute on our Four-Point Growth Strategy
Our long-term aspirational financial goals include accelerating organic revenue growth, expanding our operating margins and increasing our operating cash flows. In 2014, we introduced and began executing on a five-point growth strategy targeted to achieve those goals and to drive an extended period of quality enhancement, solution and service innovation, and increasing operating efficiency and financial performance. During 2016, the strategy evolved to account for progress to date resulting in the combination of Streamline Operations and Execute our 3-Year Margin Improvement Plan into a new initiative to Improve Operating Efficiency. Our updated strategy is as follows:

1. | Integrated and Open Solutions in the Cloud

We will continue to transition our business to predominantly serve customers through a subscription-based cloud delivery model, enabling lower cost of entry, greater scalability and lower total cost of ownership to our customers. There is a concerted effort underway to optimize our portfolio of solutions and integrate powerful capabilities — such as built in data, analytics, payment processing and tailored user-specific experiences — to bring even greater value and performance to our customers.
During 2016, we further expanded certain of our pre-integrated services through the general release of SKY Reporting™, beginning with Raiser's Edge NXT. SKY Reporting provides new business intelligence and reporting tools aimed at seamlessly delivering valuable insights and productivity enhancing capabilities to customers. We also announced the general release of SKY API, a key component of Blackbaud SKY™, which is our new, innovative cloud technology architecture for the global social good community that now powers six of our next generation solutions. SKY API allows customers, partners, and application developers to extend functionality and integrate with our solutions. For example, we announced the integration of Raiser's Edge NXT with the salesforce platform through our SKI API’s.
We acquired Attentive.ly, a cloud software provider that provides social media capabilities allowing organizations to conduct social listening, identify key influencers and drive engagement through its cloud solution. This acquisition accelerates our ability to deliver these capabilities to our customers by integrating Attentive.ly technology into Blackbaud SKY. 
We also made several portfolio announcements, ranging from solution integrations, to new capabilities for existing solutions, to new solution introductions.

2. | Drive Sales Effectiveness

We are making investments to increase the effectiveness of our sales organization, with a focus on enabling our expanding sales teams with the talent, processes, and tools to accelerate our revenue growth and improve effectiveness. Our customer success program separates account management from the sales organization, and is intended to drive customer loyalty and retention.
In early 2016, we launched a value added reseller ("VAR") program. We continued to make investments in our sales, marketing and customer success organizations and improved our market coverage by deploying these resources into key markets like Toronto, where we opened a new office. In addition, we are continuing to optimize our go-to-market sales strategies such as offering solutions and services tailored to the needs of customers operating within vertical markets including K-12 private schools, foundations, higher education and healthcare institutions, among others.

3. | Expand TAM into Near Adjacencies with Acquisitions and Investments

We will continue to evaluate compelling opportunities to acquire companies, technologies and/or services. We will be guided by our acquisition criteria for considering attractive assets that expand our total addressable market ("TAM"), provide entry into new and near adjacencies, accelerate our shift to the cloud, accelerate revenue growth, are accretive to margins and present synergistic opportunities.

4. | Improve Operating Efficiency

We have largely completed the installations of best-in-breed back-office solutions that consolidate and standardize our business operations utilizing scalable tools and systems. Our focus is now shifting towards optimizing those systems, as well as operational excellence and quality initiatives focused on streamlining processes to gain efficiency and scalability. In 2014, we implemented a 3-year operating margin improvement plan designed to increase our

Blackbaud, Inc.

operating effectiveness and efficiency and improve non-GAAP operating margins 300 to 600 basis points on a constant currency basis from our 2014 baseline of 17.5%, by the time we exit 2017.
Attract Top Talent and Actively Engage Employee Base
Our customer's passion is our purpose, and we have incredible customers whose missions make the world a better place for all of us. Driven by this purpose, our employees come to work every day knowing they can make a real difference with our customers, and thus the world. Collaboration, innovation and high standards are core to our culture and help enable the great work we do. We strive to hire the best employees and provide a workplace where their talents and potential are realized. Our employees' engagement is a focus of every leader at Blackbaud, and we continually work to understand what matters and to make our workplace better. We believe people with a passion for purpose can join our team and have a unique career experience. Our leaders are committed to our employees' personal and career development and continually work to improve the training and tools provided to their teams.    
Build our Reputation as an Industry Thought Leader 
In our 35 years of experience in the philanthropic market, we have gained significant insight into the market and industry segments in which we operate. We produce a wide range of thought leadership materials, including blogs, monthly indices and white papers, which provide insights and guidance to the social good community. We also participate in a number of industry forums where we exchange views and engage with industry and governmental leaders. Our annual user conference, bbcon™, is used in part as a forum to offer thought leadership to our customers, as well as other market specific user conferences such as our annual K-12 conference. We intend to expand these activities and further build our reputation as a thought leader within the industry.
Operating Structure
The markets we serve are very diverse, with organizations that range from small, local charities to large, multinational relief organizations. The needs of our customers can vary greatly according to their size and function. To better serve our customers' unique and wide-ranging operations, we organize our operating structure into three operating units: the General Markets Business Unit (the “GMBU”), the Enterprise Customer Business Unit (the “ECBU”) and the International Business Unit (the “IBU”).
Following is a description of each of our operating units, each of which is a reportable segment for financial accounting purposes:

• | The GMBU is focused on marketing, sales, delivery and support to all emerging and mid-sized prospects and customers in North America.


• | The ECBU is focused on marketing, sales, delivery and support to large and/or strategic prospects and customers in North America.


• | The IBU is focused on marketing, sales, delivery and support to all prospects and customers outside of North America.

Each operating unit contains specialized sales, services, support, marketing and finance functions. This structure has allowed us to be more responsive to the needs of fundamentally different customer segments and to focus on developing solutions appropriate for these unique markets while leveraging the infrastructure of our broader organization and shared technology in a cost-effective manner.
During 2016, we generated revenue in three reportable segments (the GMBU, the ECBU and the IBU) and in four geographic regions (United States, Canada, Europe and Australia), as described in more detail in Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. It is impracticable for us to identify our total assets by segment.

We had 399 and 364 direct sales employees as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We conduct marketing programs to create brand recognition and market awareness for our solutions and services. Our marketing efforts include participation at tradeshows, technical conferences and technology seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals and preparation of competitive analyses.

These companies promote or complement our nonprofit solutions and provide us access to new customers.

Blackbaud, Inc.

Corporate Philanthropy and Volunteerism
Blackbaud operates under a fundamental belief that the world would be better if good took over. The company is an active participant in the ecosystem of good, working to drive positive change both through what we do as a business and how we serve individually. We offer an array of philanthropy programs aimed at engaging our employees as agents of good, including matching gifts, competitive grants that honor excellent examples of volunteerism, employee-led grants committees, skills-based volunteerism initiatives, as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics focused community programs. Blackbaud attracts people who are committed to service, with 86% saying our focus on nonprofits was a driver in their decision to join the company, 85% actively serving as volunteers and 25% serving on a nonprofit board or committee.
Competition
The market for software and related services in the nonprofit sector is competitive and highly fragmented. For certain areas of the market, entry barriers are low, as general tools for small businesses can usually be configured to manage the most basic marketing, contact management, and accounting needs of nonprofits. However, once basic needs are met, programs unique to nonprofits like fundraising, gift and grant management, and peer-to-peer activism require highly specialized tools that are more complex to build or customize out of general business software. Moreover, because nonprofits rely heavily on relationships with and among their supporters, integration of these systems drives value beyond mere efficiency. Hence, we believe our experience, the full spectrum of our current solutions and our ability to deliver on future solutions makes us a strong competitor. We expect to continue to see new competitors as the market matures and nonprofit organizations rely more heavily on technology to manage emerging revenue channels and increasingly complex operations.
Our competition falls into three primary categories: (1) niche products that are tailored to specialized needs; (2) vertical-specific solutions; and (3) general business software that can be configured to manage some nonprofit-specific processes.
Niche products are usually developed as a solution for a single problem at an organization and are adopted by similar organizations to solve a specialized need. These are typically offered by vendors who may have deep industry expertise but may not have the resources to expand beyond a specialized area. We believe we compete against these solutions by offering a set of integrated solutions rather than a single point solution, which we believe improves the overall customer experience. In addition, our open platform allows integration to specialized applications so the opportunity for disruption from these competitors is minimized.
Vertical-specific solutions are offered by competitors seeking to meet the enterprise-wide needs of a specific sub-segment of nonprofits. Typically, these solutions are offered by vendors who may offer either a point solution or integrated suite of products used by a vertical. We believe we compete successfully against these competitors through a combination of our integrated suite of offerings within verticals where we compete, offering solutions with market leading robustness as well as the scale, reach, and reputation of our organization.
General business software vendors such as Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Oracle, compete with us in certain areas of our business. However, they generally do not have nonprofit specific focus and, therefore, do not offer or intend to offer nonprofit-specific versions. As these products are also not easily customized, the adoption of general business software is limited to nonprofits with very basic operations and simple needs. We believe our solutions compete successfully against general business software as a nonprofit’s needs grow more complex. There is a subset of general business software competitors who have introduced nonprofit-specific versions of their products. We believe that because these products were not originally designed to support the specific needs of nonprofits, they are not yet capable of meeting market needs without significant customization. As a result, we believe we are able to compete successfully to meet nonprofit-specific requirements, often integrating with general business platforms used for their more generalized operations.
Less frequently, we compete with providers of traditional, non-automated fundraising service providers, including parties providing services in support of traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, peer to peer, telemarketing and personal solicitations. We believe we compete successfully against these traditional fundraising service providers, primarily because our solutions and services are more automated, more robust, more tailored to the needs of nonprofit organization and more efficient.

Research and Development
We have made substantial investments in research and development and expect to continue to do so as a part of our strategy to introduce additional innovative solutions and services. As of December 31, 2016, we had 648 employees working on research and development. Our research and development expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $89.9 million, $84.6 million and $77.2 million, respectively. In addition, we had cash outlays for qualifying capitalized software development costs during 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $26.4 million, $15.5 million and $8.5 million, respectively. We plan to continue significantly investing in the innovation of our portfolio of solutions and services.
Technology and Architecture
Our new cloud technology, SKY, combines the latest in cloud infrastructure, leading edge development processes, and a micro service oriented architecture to deliver our next generation solutions, the first of which were Raiser's Edge NXT and Financial Edge NXT. One component of SKY, SKY API, gives customers, partners and other application developers access to industry-standard, open, Representational State Transfer (or REST) APIs and a comprehensive set of resources that enable them to customize, integrate or extend functionality of our solutions. Additionally, SKY UX, our open source user experience framework, increases the reach of our solutions by enabling developers to create interfaces that look and feel like ours by using the same user experience foundation as our engineers. SKY is now the foundation for Blackbaud's next generation solutions including Raiser’s Edge NXT, Financial Edge NXT, Blackbaud Outcomes and the next generation of Luminate Online. 
Other solutions, such as Blackbaud CRM, are built on the Microsoft.Net framework platform. These solutions are web-delivered applications utilizing an architecture built on internet standards and protocols such as HTTP, XML and SOAP. This architecture is designed to support on-premise and hosted application deployment scenarios. The applications expose web service application programming interfaces so that functionality and business logic can be accessed programmatically from outside the context of an interactive user application. Blackbaud CRM also leverages some of the SKY components.
Each of our Luminate solutions, including Luminate Online, Luminate CRM and TeamRaiser, are cloud-based applications that are open and extensible and employ a multi-tenant architecture requiring only a web browser for customer access. Luminate Online and TeamRaiser share a common codebase and database, and are built on the Java runtime environment. Luminate CRM is built on the SalesForce.com platform.
Regardless of solution choice, our development strategies are designed to be:

• | Flexible. Our component-based architecture is programmable and easily extended by our customers without requiring modification of the source code, ensuring that the technology can be extended to accommodate changing demands of our customers and the market.


• | Adaptable. The architecture of our applications allows us to easily add features and functionality or to integrate with third-party applications in order to adapt to our customers' needs or market demands.


• | Scalable. We combine a scalable architecture with the performance, capacity and load balancing of industry-standard web servers and databases used by our customers to ensure that the applications can scale to the needs of larger organizations.

We will continue to license technologies from third parties that are integrated into certain of our solutions.
