ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction
 
Ventoux CCM Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 10, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to herein as our “initial business combination.” While we may pursue an initial business combination in any region or sector, we intend to focus our efforts on businesses in North America within the hospitality, leisure, travel and dining sectors with an emphasis on consumer branded businesses that have attractive growth characteristics. In addition, we intend to pursue technology companies operating in these sectors, such as business and consumer services and infrastructure. However, we do not intend to invest in businesses with large exposure to investments in physical real estate.
 
We intend to focus on established and high-growth businesses that have an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $2.0 billion and would benefit from access to public markets and the operational and strategic expertise of our management team and board of directors. We will seek to capitalize on the significant experience of our management team in consummating an initial business combination with the ultimate goal of pursuing attractive returns for our stockholders.
 
On December 30, 2020, the Company consummated the IPO of 15,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“Common Stock”), one right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and one warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000.
 
On December 30, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement with initial stockholders of the Company of 6,000,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”), at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $6,000,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the public Units in the IPO except that (i) each Private Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, and (ii) the Private Warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Warrants.
 
On December 29, 2020, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full. The closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) occurred on January 5, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 2,250,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $22,500,000. On January 5, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 675,000 Private Warrants, generating gross proceeds of $675,000.
 
A total of $174,225,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the private placements on December 30, 2020 and January 5, 2021 were deposited in a trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than to pay our income or other tax obligations until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the Company’s failure to consummate a business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if we have extended the period of time) from the closing of the IPO, and (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the ability of holders of the Company’s public shares to seek redemption in connection with the Company’s initial business combination or the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its public shares if the Company does not complete its initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if we have extended the period of time) from the closing of the IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity.

Our management team is supported by Chardan Capital Markets’ team of investment banking professionals who each possess extensive experience in corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets, strategic consulting and operations. Mr. Jonas Grossman, Partner and President of Chardan Capital Markets, and Mr. Alex Weil, co-head of FinTech Investment Banking at Chardan Capital Markets, each serve on our board of directors. We believe Chardan’s decades of successfully executing SPAC and M&A transactions benefit us, complementing the deep sector expertise and expansive networks of Messrs. Scheetz and MacDonald, our board of directors and advisors.
 
Chardan has an extensive track record in the SPAC market as underwriter, sponsor and advisor. Since 2004, Chardan has been lead or co-lead underwriter on 88 SPAC IPOs. Since 2018, Chardan has been merger and acquisition advisor to sixteen SPACs, helping companies close transactions valued at approximately $6.4 billion. Chardan-advised SPACs have targeted a wide range of industries, including life sciences, healthcare services, technology hardware and software, financial technology, insurance, financial services, education, media & entertainment, industrials, materials, consumer staples and energy. Chardan has advised SPACs targeting both global and regional markets as well as those with more defined areas of focus in emerging and other geographic markets, including in North America. No Chardan advised or lead underwritten SPAC has liquidated to-date. In addition to its active advisory and underwriting business, Chardan’s principals have sponsored or co-sponsored twelve SPACs, six of which have closed successful business combinations, one of which has announced a business combination, three of which are currently seeking an acquisition, and two of which have publicly filed.
 
Mr. Jonas Grossman is a partner, the President and Head of Capital Markets for Chardan. Since 2003, Mr. Grossman has overseen the firm’s investment banking and capital markets activities and initiatives. He has extensive transactional experience, having led or managed more than 400 transactions during his tenure at Chardan. Mr. Grossman has nearly two decades of SPAC expertise. Mr. Grossman has provided underwriting and business combination advisory services to more than 100 SPACs in a variety of industries. He has been a founder, CEO and President of two SPACs, and holds the same positions in two SPACs that have publicly filed, Chardan NexTech Acquisition Corp and Chardan NexTech Acquisition 2 Corp. He has also served as a nonexecutive board member of two additional SPACs. Mr. Grossman was the Chief Executive Officer and President of Chardan Healthcare Acquisition Corp. from March 2018 until its merger in October 2019 with BiomX (NYSE: PHGE). Mr. Grossman is currently a director of BiomX. Mr. Grossman was a director of LifeSci Acquisition Corp. from March 2020 until its merger in December 2020 with Vincera Pharma, Inc. (now Vincerx Pharma, Inc.) (NASDAQ: VINC). He currently serves as Chief Executive Officer, President and a director of Chardan Healthcare Acquisition 2 Corp., which announced its merger with Renovacor in March 2021.
 
Mr. Alex Weil is currently co-head of FinTech investment banking at Chardan, and is CFO of Chardan NexTech Acquisition Corp and Chardan NexTech Acquisition 2 Corp. Mr. Weil has spent his career, which spans over two decades, providing strategic advisory services to global companies, senior executives, boards of directors, and investors. Mr. Weil’s background in strategic advisory work was built during his career at both global companies, as a leader in Citi’s corporate strategy and M&A group, UBS Financial Institutions Group’s investment bank, and General Electric’s corporate development group, and at boutique investment banking advisors, such as Lazard Middle Market and William Blair. Mr. Weil has advised on billions of dollars of transactions ranging from corporate divestitures and spin offs, innovative technology company acquisitions to larger, more complex M&A transactions. Mr. Weil has participated or led a variety of transactions, such as: Genworth’s spin-off IPO from General Electric; Citi-related transactions including a variety of technology and capital markets businesses (e.g. Lava Trading, Knight Options Market Making, and Automated Trading Desk) along with the creation of Citi Holdings and subsequent sales of Nikko Asset Management and its subprime auto finance business; Schwab’s acquisition of OptionsXpress; and CVC’s majority investment in Alix Partners. Mr. Weil’s extensive financial and M&A expertise will help put us in a strong position to structure profitable investments.
 
We believe the partnership between Ventoux Acquisition and Chardan offers investors a differentiated investment opportunity which brings together a management team with deep and proven industry focus with one of the leading and most successful SPAC advisors that provides deep sector expertise, an expansive network of relationships, and decades of M&A transaction experience.

Industry Opportunity
 
We intend to identify and acquire a business within the hospitality, leisure, travel and dining sectors with an overall transaction value between approximately $500 million and $2.0 billion. We believe that these sectors represent attractive target markets given the size, breadth and prospects for growth, with travel and tourism having contributed nearly $8.8 trillion to global GDP in 2018, having been expected to grow an average of 7.1% annually through 2020 prior to COVID-19, which has adversely impacted the sector. Based on demographic and behavioral trends and a long-term demand for travel and leisure experiences, consumers are investing more in experiences than products, and we believe this will continue through a down-cycle in hospitality due to COVID-19.
 
In 2019, domestic and international travelers spent $1.126 trillion in the U.S. and domestic travelers alone spent $972 billion in the U.S. (a 4.4% increase from 2018), according to the U.S. Travel Association. Moreover, domestic and international leisure travelers spent a total of $792 billion in 2019 in the U.S., up 4.1% from 2018, and domestic and international business traveler spending increased 2.2% to $334 billion in 2019. Other sectors, from entertainment to venues, tours and restaurants, also benefited as U.S. consumers invested in an inherent love for leisure, travel and dining experiences.
 
COVID-19 has created a temporary valuation dislocation, and has adversely impacted the ability of companies and business divisions to access the public and/or private financing markets. We believe that COVID-19 will create a pervasive and permanent change in global consumer and business behavior similar to previous crises, such as 9/11’s impact on travel security and the global financial crisis’ impact on (increased) financial regulation.
 
Competition for consumers’ hospitality, travel, leisure and dining spending has remained high, and resulted in companies introducing innovative concepts, technologies and strategies to establish competitive market positioning. We believe the private market for hospitality, leisure, travel and dining companies will provide attractive opportunities for identifying a business combination target. We are confident that we will identify and capitalize on the many attractive and well-positioned companies whose operating models have, or will adapt, to the changing consumer and business behaviors in a COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 environment.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our management team’s objective is to generate attractive returns and create long-term value for our stockholders by applying a disciplined approach of identifying attractive business combination targets that will benefit from becoming a publicly listed company and from the addition of strategic growth capital, management expertise and strategic insight. Our strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team, board of directors and advisors.
 
Our evaluation process will leverage our co-founders’, board’s and advisors’ network of industry, private equity sponsor, credit fund sponsor and lending community relationships, as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, restructuring advisors, attorneys and accountants, which we believe will provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We intend to deploy a pro-active, thematic sourcing strategy and to focus on companies where we believe the combination of our operating experience, relationships, capital and capital markets expertise can be catalysts to transform a target company and can help accelerate the target’s growth and performance.
 
Our management team, board and advisors have experience in:
 

● | all key activities of SPACs including, sponsoring, underwriting and M&A advisory; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating companies, setting and changing strategies, and identifying, monitoring and recruiting world-class talent;

Investment Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating candidates for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:

● | has a strong competitive industry position with demonstrated competitive advantages to maintain barriers to entry; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | has a historic record of above average growth and strong free cash flow characteristics with high returns on capital; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | has a strong, experienced management team which would benefit from our management’s network or expertise, such as additional management expertise, capital structure optimization, acquisition advice or operational changes to drive improved financial performance; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is positioned for continued organic growth and may grow through bolt-on acquisitions in these challenging times for the industry sectors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is a fundamentally sound company with a proven track record; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | has an operating model that has adapted to meet the changing consumer or business behaviors in a post-COVID 19 environment; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can benefit from being a publicly traded company, are prepared to be a publicly traded company and can utilize access to broader capital markets. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
 
Acquisition Process
 
Rigorous and comprehensive due diligence on prospective business targets is particularly important within the hospitality, travel, leisure and dining sectors in which we intend to target. In the process of identifying a potential business target, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review process which may encompass, as appropriate and among other things, meetings with incumbent management teams and stakeholders, business plan reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial, operational, legal and other information made available to us about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.
Value Creation Post Merger
 
After the initial business combination, our management team intends to apply a rigorous approach to enhancing stockholder value, including evaluating the experience and expertise of incumbent management and making changes when appropriate, examining opportunities for revenue enhancement, cost savings, operating efficiencies and strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and accessing the financial markets to optimize the company’s capital structure. Our management team intends to pursue post-merger initiatives through participation on the board of directors, through direct involvement with company operations and/or calling upon a stable of former managers and advisors when necessary.

Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placements of the Private Warrants, our shares, rights, new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, this assessment may not result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also may bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee may be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our co-sponsors, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority stockholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act), or to the extent permitted by law we may acquire interests in a variable interest entity, in which we may have less than a majority of the voting rights in such entity, but in which we are the primary beneficiary. There is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any finders or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses
 
The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our stockholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our stockholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. Because we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such arrangement to issue debt or equity securities and have no current intention of doing so.

-



The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value, enterprise value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. Investors will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of a particular target business. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire, that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or to ascertain that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account.

In order for a public stockholder to have his, her or its shares redeemed for cash in connection with any proposed business combination, we may require that the public stockholders vote either in favor of or against a proposed business combination. If required to vote pursuant to the procedures specified in our proxy statement to stockholders relating to the business combination, and a public stockholder fails to vote in favor of or against the proposed business combination, whether that stockholder abstains from the vote or simply does not vote, that stockholder would not be able to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed to cash in connection with such business combination.
 
If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we are not subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us), and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 15 months (or up to 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of the IPO in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
Our initial stockholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
 
If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Conversion/Tender Rights
 
In connection with any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. A public stockholder may be required to vote for or against a proposed business combination in order to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed for cash. If required to do so, and the stockholder fails to vote for or against a proposed business combination, that stockholder would not be able to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his, her or its shares.
 

10
--



Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public stockholder will be provided the opportunity to sell its public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
 
Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to, in or after the IPO.
 
We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his, her or its shares if the holder wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under Delaware law, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to. The conversion rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45, and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any request to convert or tender such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of the IPO, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the time period.

11
--



However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 15 months, our initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination one time by up to an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months to complete an initial business combination) without the need for a separate stockholder vote. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement, the only way to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination without the need for a separate stockholder vote is for our initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $1,725,000 (due to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) ($0.10 per share), if extended for the full 3 months, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement, if such funds are not deposited, the time to complete an initial business combination cannot be extended unless our stockholders otherwise approve an extension on different terms. In the event that they elected to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposited the applicable amount of money into trust, the initial stockholders would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline.
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 15th month (or up to the 18th month, as applicable) from the closing of the IPO and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We will seek to have all third parties and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. The underwriters in the IPO have executed such a waiver agreement.
 

12
--



As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party refuses to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver, or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if third parties execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Certain of our insiders have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.10 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our board of directors has evaluated such insiders’ financial net worth and believes they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that may arise. However, these insiders may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations, as we have not required them to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, these insiders will not be liable to our public stockholders, and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than the estimated $10.10 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors.
 
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date, and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their insider shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $50,000), and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.10.
 

13
--



If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Facilities
 
We pay to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, an affiliate of Chardan Investments, a fee of $10,000 per month for use of office space and certain office and secretarial services. The office space is located at 1 East Putnam Avenue, Floor 4, Greenwich, CT 06830. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

14
--



Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.
