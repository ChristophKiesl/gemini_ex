Item 1. Business
Overview
 
HyreCar Inc. was formed as a corporation in the State of Delaware on November 24, 2014. Our founders identified the need for a car-sharing platform for individuals who wanted to drive for ride-sharing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. (“Uber”) and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”), but whose automobiles could not meet the standards imposed by the ride-sharing companies. For example, Uber maintains strict guidelines regarding the types of cars a driver can use. Although guidelines relating to cars can differ by state, in general the use of two door coupes, motorcycles and cars that are 12 years or older are excluded. Our founders, before deciding to purchase qualifying sedans that met Uber’s strict guidelines, first inquired as to whether there were any rental options available from Uber that would allow them to drive for the ride-sharing platform. To their surprise, there were no rental options available, other than a “shadow industry” of individuals renting cars to one another.
 
HyreCar is a car-sharing marketplace that allows car owners (collectively, “Owners”) to rent their idle cars to ride-sharing service drivers (collectively, “Drivers”). By sourcing vehicles from individual Owners, part-time Drivers may more easily enter and exit the market and our business model allows us to satisfy fluctuating transportation demand in cities around the United States by matching Owners and Drivers. In 2019, we began to diversify our vehicle supply to include commercial owners of vehicles including car dealerships and fleet owners to help increase activity levels. In early 2021, we began actively promoting and adding electric vehicles to the platform.
 
Our business is based on a proprietary car-sharing marketplace developed to (i) onboard Owners and Drivers, (ii) facilitate the matching of Owners and Drivers and (iii) log rental activity for Owners and Drivers. All transactions related to the rental (including, but not limited to, background checks, rentals, deposits and insurance costs) are run securely through the HyreCar platform. Drivers and Owners access their rental or car dashboards through a unique login. Drivers can initiate, terminate or extend a rental through the platform while Owners can manage their car or fleet of cars through the platform.
 
We believe we have a competitive advantage with our commercial automobile insurance policy that covers both Owners and Drivers. The policy is specifically designed to cover the period of time in which a Driver is operating an Owner’s vehicle while not actively operating a vehicle on a ride-sharing platform, such as Uber or Lyft. During the periods when Drivers are actively operating on a ride-sharing platform, the insurance subordinates to the state mandated insurance provided by the third party ride-sharing business. To our knowledge, we are the only provider of this car-matching service utilizing this unique insurance product.
 
Our car supply has evolved from initially being provided mostly by individual owners to a majority of our car supply and rental days coming from the commercial providers – consisting primarily of auto dealers and large fleet owners. The majority of our rental days come from certain states including Georgia, California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. We have also increased driver leads matched in those same key markets, which has been achieved through organic search traffic and paid search advertising. Going forward we will direct advertising dollars strategically because we believe that online channels and offline brand awareness will provide potential opportunities for growth.
 
Impact of COVID-19 to our Business
 
In March 2020, COVID-19 began spreading rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. While the extent of the governmental measures fluctuated over time and varied across jurisdictions, the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of new COVID-19 variants on the Company’s operational and financial performance is still uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, vaccination rates, and the effectiveness of vaccines and other treatments, the emergence of new variants (e.g. Omicron) and any renewed imposition of protective public safety measures. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information.

Industry and Market Opportunities
 
Our company was founded to primarily capitalize on a combination of two growth markets: ridesharing (an industry led by Uber and Lyft) and car-sharing (an industry led by companies such as Turo, Inc. and ZipCar, Inc.). Our customers are the Drivers that use our car-sharing platform to rent a car and then use that car to earn income driving for ride share companies (or otherwise utilize the vehicle for commercial purposes, such as food delivery). Finding enough cars and drivers to meet demand has historically been a problem for ride-sharing companies. Recently we have expanded our target marketing to Drivers who provide delivery services with companies like Instacart and Doordash.
 
The transportation industry represents a massive market. In the United States alone, consumer expenditures on transportation were approximately $1.2 trillion and $1.4 trillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively with 2021 preliminary estimates seeing an increase from 2020 pandemic low levels. Transportation was the second largest household expenditure after housing and was almost twice as large as healthcare and three times as large as entertainment. We believe we are still in the relatively early phases of potentially capturing part of the opportunity in the industry. In 2019, ridesharing accounted for just seven percent of total vehicle miles travelled in the United States and in a 2016 survey, 57% of U.S. respondents who used sharing services said that well-priced and convenient offerings could cause them to give up ownership altogether.
 
We have added over 70,000 Drivers over the past several years, matching them with Owner vehicles that have been used on rideshare and delivery platforms. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we added approximately 22,000 and 14,000 new Drivers, respectively, into cars so that they could drive for ride-share and delivery companies. These numbers represent an approximate 57% growth rate in new drivers onto the HyreCar platform year over year.
 
Ride-sharing Industry (Uber and Lyft)
 
The growth in ridesharing over the past few years has kicked off a transportation revolution. Smart phones are now used as ride hailing apps, transactions are processed through online platforms and transportation as a service is becoming more and more personalized. The industry has experienced significant traction. According to a July 2016 post on TechCrunch, it took Uber six years, to December 2015, to complete a billion trips and in 2021 Uber reported over 6 billion trips, a tremendous acceleration in growth and adoption.
 
Transportation Network Companies (“TNCs”) like Uber and Lyft have historically reported high demand from Drivers but many of these Drivers do not own a car that qualifies for their platforms. Uber reported that it had 4.4 million drivers earning on its platform at the end of 2021. According to Gridwise in 2020, a leading business app that helps rideshare and delivery drivers maximize earnings, between 15 and 20% of rideshare drivers reported not using or intending to use their own vehicle on the rideshare platforms, indicating a large potential demand for rental vehicles that might continue to increase with an increasing volume of rideshare drivers. Accordingly, TNCs are actively taking steps to satisfy their driver demand by setting up programs designed to get eligible drivers into qualified cars, including such programs as the Enterprise/Uber partnership, the Lyft Express Driver partnership with Hertz and Pep Boys and the General Motor’s Maven program. These programs indicate that there is a potential healthy market to pair eligible drivers with qualified cars.
 
Food and Package Industry (Instacart and Grubhub)
 
With the growth in food, package and grocery delivery services such as Instacart, Doordash, Uber Eats and Grubhub, HyreCar expects driver demand for services such as HyreCar's platform to continue into 2022 and beyond. With estimated revenue for food app delivery companies at $27B in 2020 up from $22B in 2019 according to McKinsey and forecasts from several sources in the $40M+ range in 2025, the trends indicate growth in that segment that HyreCar can further capitalize on. Drivers participating into the Gig economy are diversifying their sources of income across many different TNCs and delivery services. Over 60% of all HyreCar drivers are active drivers for both rideshare and delivery service companies.
Car-sharing Industry
 
Shared mobility market began to rapidly develop around 2010-2011 when the total number of its users exceeded one million. In 2017, there were already around 10 million people using this type of service, and according to a study by Frost & Sullivan, by 2025 their numbers will reach 36 million, maintaining the annual growth rate of 16.4%. Statista forecasts the value of the global car sharing market in 2022 at $13 billion. At present, the leading shared mobility markets are the U.S. and Western Europe, while experts predict that Asia will experience the fastest growth in this field. HyreCar is attempting to capitalize on this opportunity as demand from traditional taxi and public transportation options continues to be, in part, transferred to shared transportation services. Further, growth is expected from this opportunity as the accelerating trend of the mass ease-of-use and availability of shared transportation permanently shifts some driving habits away from personal vehicle ownership. Evidence of this decline, while not yet a national trend, can be seen in large cities as vehicle ownership is beginning to decline. Longer term, we envision a potential impact on the auto industry as a whole from a subset of people permanently changing their driving habits and selling their cars entirely in favor of using shared transportation.

Competition
 
We believe the key differentiator between HyreCar and our competitors is our asset light model, which allows us to connect excess car inventory to drivers without owning or managing the vehicles. This allows our prices to be competitive with other vehicle solutions because we do not have the monthly vehicle overhead or infrastructure costs that our competitors may have. Other advantages of our platform include the following:

1. | Pay-As-You-Go: Drivers using our platform are not locked into lengthy lease agreements, monthly contracts or subscription fees. Our payment model is upfront and transparent. While our competitors engage in auto-debiting payment for the rented vehicle from the Drivers’ accounts, regardless of their current account balance, under our platform Drivers pay for the term of rental up-front, extend if they are financially able, and return the rented vehicle whenever they need with no “strings” attached. We believe we are the only company providing this type of fluid and frictionless car transaction for Uber and Lyft drivers.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Convenience: In some cases, Drivers on our platform are renting a car from a local supplier or even their neighbor. They walk down the street, take the keys and go. With Hertz or Avis, only a small portion of retail outlets participate in the Uber and Lyft programs. 
3. | Flexibility: The ability to use the same car for both rideshare companies plus food and other deliveries is an important reason why many drivers choose our platform. Coupled with a comprehensive protection program that includes insurance, drivers are attracted to this unique service not offered by our competition. 

 
Among vehicle solutions for ride-sharing rentals, are Avis, Hertz, Getaround and HyreCar. These car rental companies are similar in one way: they operate in the U.S. and provide cars drivers to rent and drive on the Uber or Lyft platform. However, their business models vary widely.
 
Hertz (OTC:HTZGQ) and Fair.com (“Fair”) were competitors with vehicle supply partnerships with Uber, but both experienced hardships in 2020. Hertz declared bankruptcy mid-year and following Uber’s spring 2019 initial public offering, Fair was offering promotional weekly rates to Uber drivers, which presented a competitive threat in certain marketing, particularly in California. The partnership ended in February 2020 when Uber announced it was ending this “Fair Go” partnership, and as a result Fair has exited the weekly rental business.
 
A high level comparative analysis of markets, pricing limitations and age requirements are as follows for a sample of key competitors: 
 

Markets | Nationwide | 30 States | 10 Cities for Lyft, 11 States for Uber | 10 Cities 
Rental Length and Age Requirement | 2-Day Minimum / 21+ | 7-Day Minimum / 25+ | 7-Day Minimum / 25+ | 1-Hour Minimum / 21+
Service Limitation | No Limits | Uber Only | Lyft and Uber Only | Uber Only 
Deposit | $0 ($99 in CA/NV/AZ) | $200 | $200 | $150 
Payments accepted | Credit, Debit, Prepaid | Credit or Credit check required | Credit or Credit check required | Credit only 
All-In Estimated Cost Range* | $320-$400 | $300-$330 | $320-$450 | $400-$500 

 
* Includes insurance, weekly cost assumes 1,000 miles driven per week, assumes maximum 12-hour rental per day

Our Strengths
 
Using our website platform or mobile applications (iOS and Android), vehicle Owners can post their cars to our marketplace and Drivers can browse car inventory prior to rental. Once a Driver finds a car, he or she creates a profile, enters his or her personal information and credentials (including, address, city, state, a copy of applicable state issued driver’s license, Uber or Lyft credentials and social security number) and submits a credit card for payment. We then perform a criminal background check, DMV driving record check, Homeland Security Watch-list and Sex Offender database check. HyreCar’s screening criteria is stricter than Uber and Lyft’s background check and we are focused on maintaining a safe user experience and seek to ensure that all transactions between owners and drivers are processed through a secure web platform. We believe the attraction and vetting of qualified gig economy drivers is a primary reason why commercial automobile businesses around the country utilize the Company's platform.
Why Drivers Use Our Service
 

● | Attractive Economics: Steadily increasing earning potential for drivers on ride-sharing and delivery platforms easily covers car rental cost.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform Agnostic: Ability to earn income by driving for multiple ride-sharing or delivery services simultaneously.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pay-As-You-Go: Drivers are not locked into long-term lease agreements or monthly payments or even subscription fees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Convenience: Drivers can quickly pick up the car from a location close by. Typically getting behind the wheel in under 48 hours.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transparency and Trust: No hidden fees and only Car Owners who have been properly vetted are permitted to use the platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer Experience: Application of game-design elements (i.e. gamification) of the platform keeps Drivers engaged.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Owners Use Our Service
 
Data from a national survey of driving behavior indicates that private vehicles are in use 5% or less during any given day, or about one hour per day. Given the excess capacity of vehicle hours, higher vehicle utilization rates, and lower vehicle ownership rates, we expect a consumer shift towards acceptance of car-sharing. Based on the results of the survey, we believe our platform is advantageous for the following reasons:

● | Passive Income: We often match Owners with long term Drivers, which provides the Owners with a steady source of passive income resulting from our re-booking process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insurance: Physical damage and liability policies offered through the Company help fill the “gaps” left by personal and ride-sharing policies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Review of Drivers: Drivers must pass our extensive background checks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance Coverage
 
A key component to our business is our commercial auto insurance coverage. The two-sided nature of our platform means that we need to insure both the Driver and the Owner. Prior to any rental the Driver and Owner are provided an insurance ID card that lists the Driver’s name and the vehicle identification number. Insurance is typically generated for the rental until the Owner confirms drop-off of the rented vehicle by the Driver. The vehicle pick-up and drop-off is all managed through our platform. An Owner takes pictures of his or her vehicle prior to pressing the “Confirm Pick-up” button on the HyreCar mobile app. After the rental is completed, the Owner presses the “Confirm Drop-off” button on the HyreCar mobile app and the rental ends.

AON is our insurance broker utilizing their Digital Economy Practice for consulting and insurance placement activities. AON is a leading global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in risk, retirement and health. We moved our annual automobile insurance policy to Apollo for the policy year June 2020 to June 2021 and in May 2021 renewed the policy to extend through January 2023.
 
For insurance purposes a vehicle rental is broken into four distinct driving periods. Period 0 is when the Driver has picked a vehicle up from the Owner and is driving with the Uber or Lyft app turned-off. Period 1 is when the Driver has the Uber or Lyft app turned-on but has not yet accepted a fare. Period 2 is when the Driver has accepted a fare and is on the way to pick-up a passenger. Period 3 is when a passenger is in the vehicle. The HyreCar policy is specifically written to cover periods in which the Drivers are operating HyreCar vehicles OFF the Uber or Lyft platform (period 0). During the periods when Drivers are operating ON the Uber or Lyft platform (periods 1, 2 and 3), the HyreCar liability insurance mostly subordinates to state mandated insurance provided by Uber and Lyft. This enables us to keep insurance costs and liability low by leveraging state mandated insurance policies provided by the TNCs.
 
Business Structure and Strategy

We operate primarily out of our corporate office in Los Angeles, California. Our technology platform allows for a relatively small staff compared to the size and reach of our business. For example, our platform matches drivers and owners in certain states and key markets where we have no physical presence. Our business structure is divided into three distinct departments: General and Administrative, Sales and Marketing and Research and Development.
 
Our Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success teams continue to be critical drivers of growth with responsibility for acquisition, engagement, and retention of demand and supply.  As we have oriented our technology stack around the user experience, we have made searching for and booking vehicles a more seamless process. We have found that a portion of our leads are able to convert to verified drivers and book their first rental with few manual touchpoints. As we continue to invest in creating a frictionless, more automated first rental experience, we have also optimized how and when our sales resources intervene in the driver and owner journeys to drive customer success. In 2021, we continued the transition  of our sales teams to success agents tasked with resolving complex issues and providing guidance on maximizing rideshare productivity for Drivers and utilization for Owners in order to increase system revenue.
 
Our Customer Success Division is composed of four distinct teams: Driver Success, Owner Success, Utilization, and Customer Service. First, the Driver Success team is mostly based offshore and is divided into two groups. One group is responsible for facilitating background checks and identity verifications, and another group helps drivers with booking their first rental and extending rentals through a consultative, earnings-maximization approach. Second, the Owner Success team builds and maintains relationships with Owner customers for our peer-to-peer, mini-fleet, and fleet segments to onboard, retain and steadily increase supply of vehicles across all regions, with a focus on HyreCar’s top 15 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Strategic Account Managers are placed in-market and are responsible for sourcing commercial supply, including through dealerships, rental agencies, and purpose-built fleets. These team members have fleet operations backgrounds and rental management expertise that are used to prospect, onboard, and grow commercial supply on the marketplace. Through these customer relationships, the team has developed a replicable and scalable “HyreCar Owner Playbook” that provides guidance on setting up rideshare-friendly and compliant fleets as well as rental management best practices to maximize profitability. The Owner success team drove over 14,000 new car listings on the HyreCar marketplace in 2021. Third, the Utilization team is responsible for overall marketplace liquidity and growth, working with both owners and drivers to incentivize rental applications, increase approvals, and drive extensions to maximize rental days. Finally, the Customer Service team is mostly composed of offshore associates who operate 24/7 to cover inbound inquiries related to their rental experience such as claims, payments, and roadside assistance.
 
We currently operate with one Technology Development team in the United States, including multiple full-time developers based out of our home office in Los Angeles and overseas. The team is tasked with maintaining the current codebase and website, and incrementally adding enhancement to the Owner and Driver application and website to support our expansion into institutional car supply nationally.
 
In 2021, we executed several initiatives intended to increase sales and operational efficiency. In addition, to technology-driven automation, we moved driver-facing Customer Success and Customer Service teams offshore, and expanded their size to prepare for growth at scale. The implementation of a single communications and case management platform across all Customer Success teams contributed to a 36% reduction in inbound customer cases. Technology-driven enhancements to the vehicle listing process and the internal re-organization of the sales teams led to an increase of owner lead conversion by 19% between the first quarter and the fourth quarter, while reducing headcount.  
 
Looking forward to 2022 and as 34% of the general population joined the gig economy during the pandemic according to some sources, we believe that demand will continue to increase as a result of macroeconomic conditions, a fundamental shift in customer preferences for delivery accelerated by the pandemic and rising inflation. While supply chain shortages and a strong used vehicle market have presented challenges for supply, we expect that our current strategy focusing on partnerships and investments in acquiring and growing large fleet operators to our platform, including AmeriDrive, will provide a steady and dedicated supply of vehicles to satisfy that demand. Additionally, offerings for smaller operators designed to help them scale to steadily increase vehicle supply in 2022 will also help us meet an increasing portion of the anticipated demand. 
 
By continuing to invest in automation and focusing on the creation of additional self-service opportunities for drivers and owners, we anticipate reduced operational expenses and an improved customer experience. Planned initiatives include the implementation of AI-driven chatbots and increased use of chat as a channel that will provide faster, more responsive 24/7 issue resolution, improve platform engagement, and increase utilization. To increase rental conversion, we are developing features that will make it faster, simpler, and more fun to find, book, and start trips with HyreCar. This includes pre-filtered listings based on driver preferences, searchable listings on Google, application approvals/extension automation, and gamification.

Revenue Model
 
We generate revenue by taking a fee out of each rental processed on our platform. Each rental transaction represents a Driver renting a car from an Owner. Drivers pay a daily rental rate set by the Car Owner, plus a 10%-20% HyreCar Driver Fee and direct daily insurance costs. Owners receive their daily rental rate minus a 15-30% HyreCar Owner Fee. For example, as of December 31, 2021, the average daily rental rate of a HyreCar vehicle nationally is approximately $38.00 (“Daily Rental Rate”), plus a 10%-20% HyreCar Driver fee ($6) and daily direct insurance fee of $15.00, totaling $59 in total daily gross billings is paid by the Driver via a card transaction. On average approximately 77% of the daily rental or $30 is transferred to the Owner via our merchant processing partner. HyreCar earns revenues from the two revenue share fees and the insurance totaling approximately $30 per day. Accordingly, the GAAP reportable revenue recognized by HyreCar is $29 in this example transaction, as detailed in the following table:

Daily Gross Revenue Example | Daily Net (GAAP) Revenue Example | 
-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+------
National Average Daily Rental Rate | $ | 38.00 | HyreCar Owner Fee (~23% Average) | $ | 9.00 
Driver Fee | $ | 6.00 | HyreCar Driver Fee (~15% Average) | $ | 6.00 
Daily Insurance Fee | $ | 15.00 | Insurance Fee (100% of fee) | $ | 15.00
Daily Gross Billing Paid by Driver | $ | 59.00 | Daily Average Net Revenue | $ | 30.00

 
Gross billings is an important measure by which we evaluate and manage our business. We define gross billings as the amount billed to Drivers, without any adjustments for amounts paid to Owners or refunds. It is important to note that gross billings is a non-GAAP measure and as such, is not recorded in our financial statements as revenue. However, we use gross billings to assess our business growth, scale of operations and our ability to generate gross billings is strongly correlated to our ability to generate revenues. Gross billings may also be used to calculate net revenue margin, defined as the company’s GAAP reportable revenue over gross billings. Using the definition of net revenue margin and the example above, HyreCar’s net revenue margin is equal to approximately 49% for the full-year ended December 31, 2021 ($35,716,031 HyreCar’s GAAP revenue over $73,344,808 Total Gross Billings) and about 51% for the fourth quarter of 2021. A breakout of revenue components is provided in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the footnotes to our audited consolidated financial statements.
 
Marketing Plan
 
Historically, we have used promotions to drive engagement and conversion at different points in the driver and owner funnels. Our acquisition funnel was primarily relying on paid channels (including keywords on internet search engines), and our driver funnel resulted in over 365,000 driver applicants in 2021, of which only a portion rented through the Company leaving demand unfulfilled. In 2022, to increase conversion rates, total number of rental days, and vehicle supply we are investing in the creation of value for drivers and owners beyond vehicle and driver access. By building on our affiliates network and leveraging the collective buying power of our user base, we are incorporating strategic partnerships and integrations into our product offerings and creating a potentially monetizable ecosystem that expands our platform beyond matching supply and demand. These efforts include the implementation of tools to help drivers learn when and where to drive to maximize earnings, the launch of a driver discounts and perks program, and an Owner marketplace for discounts and special access to products and services that reduce vehicle/fleet operating costs. Through our partnership with AmeriDrive, we are able to test and launch supply-side programs at scale as we continue to experiment with fleet offerings that drive supply retention and obtain live data feedback. We expect improved retention and loyalty of owners and drivers to reduce our operational overhead while significantly increasing lifetime value and spend efficiency across all channels as we benefit from increased organic, higher-quality leads and referrals.

Insurance Opportunity
 
Most of our cost of revenue is related to direct insurance premiums and claims expense. The premiums are broken into two categories, liability insurance and physical damage. The unique nature of our insurance enables us to keep insurance costs and liability low by leveraging state-mandated insurance policies provided by the Transportation Network Companies.
 
In addition to self-insurance, the Company is also working continuously with AON to develop new and innovative insurance products. The Company has developed alternative insurance opportunities including a new type of owner “lay-up” insurance and higher insurance level for fleet vehicle owners on the HyreCar platform. Lay-up insurance replaces the need for an owner’s personal auto insurance policy and represents significant cost savings when compared to other insurance options available in the market today. Offering this type of insurance product benefits the company in multiple verticals, including reduced insurance claim expense, greater customer retention and stickiness to the HyreCar platform.
 
Regulation
 
The California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) was the first state regulatory body to impose rules and guidelines for ridesharing in the United States. The CPUC designated Uber and Lyft as “transportation network companies” or TNCs. The CPUC guidelines became the standard for all states across the U.S. Most states have adopted some form of the guidelines. California is one of the strictest states when it comes to regulating the TNCs. Our insurance works within the California guidelines which potentially makes it adoptable by future state mandates outside of California.
 
Changes in government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices or our operational results. Depending on the jurisdiction, those changes may come about through the issuance of new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations by a court, regulatory body or governmental official. Sometimes those changes may have not just prospective but also retroactive effect; this is particularly true when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time. Moreover, changes in regulation that may seem neutral on their face may have either more or less impact on us than on ride-sharing businesses, depending on the circumstances. Potential changes in law or regulation that may affect us relate to insurance intermediaries, customer privacy, data security and rate regulation.
 
In addition, our operations also could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. We are not aware of any current proposal to impose such a regime in the U.S. or internationally. Such a regime could, however, be quickly imposed if there was a serious disruption in the fuel supply for any reason, including an act of war, terrorist incident or a natural disaster affecting the petroleum supply, refining, distribution or pricing.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employ 76 full-time personnel primarily in our headquarters location in downtown Los Angeles, California. Our team moved to a hybrid (in office and remote) work schedule as of the third quarter of 2021 after having been mainly remote since March 2020 due to COVID-19 limitations.
