ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
In this annual report on Form 10-K we use the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Mercari Communications Group, Ltd. We refer to our $.00001 par value common stock as our common stock.
 
Except for historical information, the following description of our business may contain forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.
 
Business
 
We are a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.
 
We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination which may take the form of a “reverse merger” with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our stockholders. Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict our discretion. This discussion of the proposed business is not meant to be restrictive of our virtually unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business opportunities.
 
We have not yet entered into any definitive agreement, nor do we have any binding commitment or understanding to enter into or become engaged in a transaction.
 
We are not restricting our search for business combination candidates to any particular industry and will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire a venture which is in its preliminary or development stage, one which is already in operation, or in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.
 
We believe that there are numerous businesses seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. These benefits are commonly thought to include the following: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the marketplace; (iii) ease of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) improved stock trading efficiency; (v) shareholder liquidity; (vi) greater ease in subsequent capital raising; (vii) compensation of key employees through stock options; (viii) enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States capital market. We have not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data to support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity.
 
Target companies interested in a business combination with our company may include the following: (i) a company for whom a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of other assets or businesses; (ii) a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it; (iii) a company which desires to become public with less dilution of its common stock than would occur upon an underwriting; (iv) a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public; (v) a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United States securities market; or (vi) a company seeking one or more of the other mentioned perceived benefits of becoming a public company.
 
We anticipate seeking out a target business through solicitation. Such solicitation may include personal contacts, newspaper or magazine advertisements, mailings and other distributions to law firms, accounting firms, investment bankers, financial advisors and similar persons, the use of one or more World Wide Web sites and similar methods. No estimate can be made as to the number of persons who will be contacted or solicited. Such persons will have no relationship to our management.

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our executive officers and directors, none of whom is a business analyst and it is not anticipated that outside consultants or advisors will be utilized to assist us in the analysis of qualified target companies.
 
A decision to participate in a specific business opportunity will be made based upon our analysis of the quality of the prospective business opportunity’s management and personnel, assets, the anticipated acceptability of products or marketing concepts, the merit of a proposed business plan, and numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze using any objective criteria. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities.
 
In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider, among others, the following kinds of factors: (i) potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; (ii) competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; (iii) strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; (iv) capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by our company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; (v) the cost of participation by our company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; (vi) the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and (vii) the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items.
 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another entity. We also may acquire stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of a transaction it is probable that the present management and stockholders of our company will no longer be in control of the company. In addition, our officers and directors, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, likely will be required to resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors without a vote of our stockholders.
 
It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of a transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on that market.
 
While the actual terms of a transaction to which we may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition as a “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company which the target company stockholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders at such time.

We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants.
 
On the date we consummate a merger or acquisition with a target business we must file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) including information required by a registration statement on Form 10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) containing information concerning the acquired business, including audited financial statements of the target business. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the target company, the closing documents may provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable at the discretion of our present management.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Registrant of the related costs incurred.
 
Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.
 
Competition
 
We will remain an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than us. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
Employees
 
We presently have no employees. Quanzhong Lin, our Chief Executive Officer and President, is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business a limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
Our Principal Office
 
Our principal office is located at 1120 Avenue of the Americas, 4th floor, New York,, NY 10036.
 
Company History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on December 30, 1987. From 1987 until early in 1990, we were engaged in the business of providing educational products, counseling, seminar programs, and publications such as newsletters to adults aged 30 to 50. Our business failed in early 1990. We ceased all operating activities during the period from June 1, 1990 to August 31, 2001 and were considered dormant.
 
During 2001, we were reactivated and sought to merge with another company which had assets and an active business. From November 30, 2001 to March 1, 2004, we were in the development stage. During each of the years since we were reactivated, we have had no revenue and have had losses approximately equal to the expenditures required to reactivate and comply with filing and reporting obligations. We do not expect any revenue unless and until a business acquisition transaction is completed. Expenditures have been paid by us from capital contributions and loans made to us by our principal stockholders and entities controlled by our directors.

On November 9, 2009, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. or “Algodon” (formerly Diversified Private Equity Corporation or “DPEC”), a then privately-held Delaware corporation, and Kanouff, LLC (“KLLC”) and Underwood Family Partners, Ltd. (the “Partnership”), of which KLLC and the Partnership were our majority stockholders (the “Stock Purchase”). In connection with the Stock Purchase, Algodon purchased and we sold, an aggregate of 43,822,001 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $43,822, or $0.001 per share. In addition, Algodon purchased 200 shares of common stock from KLLC and 200 shares of common stock from the Partnership for a purchase price of $180,000 payable to each selling shareholder, of which $105,000 was paid at closing and $75,000 had previously been paid in connection with a letter of intent and related amendments. Immediately following the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, there were 45,411,400 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Immediately following the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Algodon owned an aggregate of 43,822,401 shares of our common stock out of the total of 45,411,400 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the closing, or approximately 96.5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares.
 
On January 20, 2017, Algodon sold all 43,822,401 shares of our common stock owned by it, representing approximately 96.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock as part of the transactions described below, which resulted in a change in control of our company.
 
Recent Developments
 
Change in Control
 
On February 2, 2017, Quanzhong Lin, an entrepreneur resident in the People’s Republic of China, purchased 29,521,410 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, for a purchase price of $300,000, from China Concentric Capital Group Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company (“China Concentric”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 21, 2016. China Concentric had purchased 43,822,001 share of our common stock, representing approximately 96.5%, of our outstanding shares of common stock, from Algodon on January 20, 2017, for a total purchase price of $260,000 pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2016, as amended. Algodon also assigned to China Concentric all its right, title and interest to amounts payable to Algodon for non-interest bearing advances to our company, which advances, as of January 20, 2017 were in the aggregate amount of $150,087, and any additional advances made to our company up until the closing date as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
 
On February 2, 2017, in conjunction with the closing of the sale to Mr. Lin, our then Board of Directors elected Mr. Lin as a director, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of our company, effective upon the closing, and Ethan Chuang, who had served as President of our company since January 20, 2017, as our Vice President. Mr. Chuang, who was elected to our Board on January 20, 2017, continues to serve as a director of our company. Mr. Chuang was elected Secretary of our corporation on July 18, 2017.
 
Reincorporation Merger
 
On July 21, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which we would be merged with and into our newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, AiXin Life International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“AiXin” or “AiXin Life”), as a result of which our state of incorporation will be changed from Colorado to Nevada (the “Reincorporation Merger”). The Merger Agreement and the Reincorporation Merger was approved by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting of our Board of Directors and by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting of stockholders owning in the aggregate 96.50% of our outstanding voting shares. The Merger is subject to approval by the Financial Regulatory Authority.

Reason for the Reincorporation Merger
 
Our Board of Directors believes that a change in our state of incorporation from Colorado to Nevada will meet our business needs and that the Colorado Business Corporations Act (“CBCA”) does not offer corporate law advantages comparable to those provided by the laws of the State of Nevada. Reincorporation from Colorado to Nevada also may make it easier to attract future candidates willing to serve on our board of directors.
 
The Reincorporation Merger is not being effected to prevent a change in control, nor is it in response to any present attempt known to our Board of Directors to acquire control of the Company or obtain representation on our Board. Nevertheless, certain effects of the proposed reincorporation may be considered to have anti-takeover implications simply by virtue of being subject to Nevada law. For example, in responding to an unsolicited bidder, the Nevada Revised Statutes authorizes directors to consider not only the interests of stockholders, but also the interests of employees, suppliers, creditors, customers, the economy of the state and nation, the interests of the community and society in general, and the long-term as well as short-term interests of the corporation and its stockholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation. For a discussion of these and other differences between the laws of Colorado and Nevada, see the Information Statement filed with the SEC and available on its website at sec.gov and distributed to our stockholders on July 24, 2017 )the “Information Statement”) under the caption “Reincorporation Merger – Reason for the Reincorporation Merger —Significant Differences between Colorado and Nevada Law.”
 
Consequences of the Reincorporation Merger
 
The Reincorporation Merger will effect a change in our legal domicile from Colorado to Nevada, a change in our name to AiXin Life International, Inc. and other changes of a legal nature, the most significant of which are described under the caption in the Information Statement “Reincorporation Merger – Reason for the Reincorporation Merger —Significant Differences between Colorado and Nevada Law.” However, the Reincorporation Merger will not result in any change in headquarters, business, management, location of our offices, assets, liabilities or net worth, other than as a result of the costs incident to the Reincorporation Merger. Our management, including all directors and officers, will remain the same in connection with the Reincorporation Merger and will assume identical positions with AiXin Life. There will be no employment agreements for executive officers or other direct or indirect interest of the current directors or executive officers of our company in the Reincorporation Merger as a result of the reincorporation. Upon the effective time of the Reincorporation Merger, your shares of Mercari common stock will be converted into an equal number of shares of common stock of AiXin Life.
 
The authorized capital stock of Mercari consists of 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 950,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share. The authorized capital stock of AiXin Life will consist of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Holders of AiXin Life common stock will be entitled to equal voting rights, consisting of one vote per share on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote. Holders of AiXin Life common stock will not have cumulative voting rights. Therefore, holders of a majority of the shares of AiXin Life common stock voting for the election of directors will be able to elect all of the directors. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of AiXin Life stock entitled to vote will be required to constitute a quorum at any meeting of AiXin Life stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of AiXin Life’s outstanding shares will be required to effectuate certain fundamental corporate changes such as liquidation, merger or an amendment to our articles of incorporation. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, either voluntarily or involuntarily, each outstanding share of AiXin Life common stock will be entitled to share equally in the assets of AiXin Life.
 
Holders of AiXin Life common stock will not have pre-emptive rights or conversion rights and there will be no redemption provisions applicable to AiXin Life common stock. Holders of AiXin Life common stock will be entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by AiXin Life’s board, out of funds legally available therefor.
 
The articles of incorporation of AiXin Life, like the articles of incorporation of Mercari, gives the Board of Directors the power to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. The board of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock. The purpose of authorizing the board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of a corporation’s outstanding voting stock. AiXin Life has no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Operating as a Nevada corporation will not interfere with, or differ substantially from, our present corporate activities. As a Nevada corporation, we will be governed by Nevada corporate law, while the Company is presently governed by Colorado law. Nevada law may constitute a comprehensive, flexible legal structure under which to operate. However, because of differences in the laws of these states, the rights of our shareholders will change in several material respects as a result of the reincorporation, the most significant of which are described in our Information Statement under the caption “Reincorporation Merger – Reason for the Reincorporation Merger —Significant Differences between Colorado and Nevada Law.”
