Item 1. Business.
General Information



Advanced Container Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on September 5, 1997. It changed its corporate name to Acology, Inc. on January 9, 2014; on August 28, 2018, to Medtainer, Inc.; and on October 3, 2020, to its present name.



On October 9, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Advanced Container Technologies, Inc., a California corporation (“ACT”), that has the same corporate name as the Company, from its shareholders pursuant to an Exchange Agreement, dated August 14, 2020, which was amended on September 9, 2020 (as so amended, the “Exchange Agreement”), in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“Common Stock”). This exchange resulted in ACT’s becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. For information as to the business that the Company conducts through ACT, see Item 1, Business – Products and Services – GrowPods and for information as to the interests of certain persons in the Exchange Agreement, see Item 13, Exchange Agreement.



The acquisition of ACT represented a material change in the business strategy of the Company and an expansion of its product base. Since the inception of the Company in 2014, its intended growth strategy was to concentrate on increasing sales of Medtainers, while introducing related products and services, such as humidity control inserts and printing. This approach resulted in relatively flat revenues, increasing expenses and a history of losses. Management believes that this acquisition offered the prospect of substantially increased revenues, without a comparable increase in expenses an opportunity to expand its profits significantly. For further information respecting some of the bases for these expectations, see Item 1, Business – GrowPods – The Market for GrowPods. The Company has announced that it is exploring with GP the acquisition of its assets and the assumption of some or all of its liabilities in exchange for shares of Common Stock (the “GP Acquisition”). Discussions are in their preliminary stages and none of the terms and conditions of the acquisition has been determined, including the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to GP in exchange for its assets or the liabilities of GP that the Company would assume. The Company intends to structure any transaction such that its board of directors and executive officers would not be changed and that voting control of the Company would not be affected.



The Company’s authorized capital is 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share. On October 3, 2020, the Company combined the outstanding shares of its Common Stock on the basis of one share for every 59 shares then outstanding; the number of authorized shares of Common Stock and preferred stock was unaffected. The effect of this combination has been applied to all periods covered by this report. The Company has also designated 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) and, on July 31, 2020, issued them to its chief executive officer in exchange for 305,085 shares of his Common Stock; these shares, together with the shares of Common Stock owned by him, confer voting control of the Company on him. See Item 10, Employment Agreement.



The Company’s principal place of business is located at 1620 Commerce St., Corona, CA 92878. The Company’s telephone number is (951) 381-2555. The Company has two corporate websites: www.advancedcontainertechnologies.com for GrowPods and related items and www.medtainer.com for Medtainers and related products and services. Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Link, a quotation system operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”), under the trading symbol ACTX.
Products and Services



The Company markets and sells two principal products: (i) GrowPods, which are specially modified insulated shipping containers manufactured by GP Solutions, Inc. (“GP”), in which plants, herbs and spices may be grown hydroponically in a controlled environment (“GrowPods”) and (ii) Medtainers, which may be used to store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids and can grind solids and shred herbs. The Company also markets and sells various products related to GrowPods and the Medtainer. GrowPods and their related products are described in Item 1, Business, Products and Services – GrowPods, and the Medtainer and its related products are described in Item 1, Business – Products and Services – The Medtainer. The Company also provides private labeling and branding services for purchasers of Medtainers and certain related products. For further details, see Item 1, Business – Printing.

The Company markets its Medtainer products and services directly to businesses through its phone room, to the retail public through internet sales, and directly to wholesalers and other businesses who resell its products to other businesses and end-users, and sells GrowPods and related products through agents. See Item 1, Business – Sales and Distribution.



GrowPods and Related Products



Beginning January 1, 2021, the Company commenced sales of GrowPods and related products, and during the year, it sold 40 units for which it received revenues of $3,002,000. GrowPods are used to grow, farm and cultivate flowers, fruits, plants, vegetables, cannabis, grains and herbs hydroponically, in controlled-environment settings that allow end-users to control key farming variables, including temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light intensity spectrum, nutrient concentration and pH. The Company also sells branded growing media and nutrients. For further information respecting the Distributorship Agreement, see Item 1, Business – Products and Services – GrowPods and Related Products.

Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, by using nutrients that are dissolved in water. Plants may be grown with only their roots exposed to nutrients or roots may be physically supported by an inert growing medium such as perlite and gravel. The spaces in which plants may be grown range from mason jars at one extreme to large warehouses and covered terrain at the other. There are several growing techniques, including (i) static solution culture, in which plants are grown in smaller containers of nutrient solution, (ii) continuous-flow solution culture, in which the nutrient solution constantly flows past the root, which facilitates automation because sampling and adjustments to the temperature, pH, and nutrient concentrations, (iii) agroponics and fogoponics, in which roots are kept in an environment saturated with fine drops or a mist of nutrient solution, (iv) “run to waste,” in which a nutrient solution is applied one or more times per day to a container of inert growing media and which may be automated with a delivery pump, a timer and irrigation tubing to deliver nutrient as appropriate in light of plant size, plant growing stage, climate, substrate, and substrate conductivity, pH, and water content and (v) deep-water culture, in which suspended roots are fed a solution of nutrient-rich, oxygenated water.



GrowPods



GrowPods are 20- or 40-foot insulated food-grade containers that GP modifies to add climate control, aqueous or soil-based platforms, LED lighting, a nutrient tank, an irrigation system, a reverse-osmosis water purification system, air and water filters, and remote monitoring. Optionally, GP adds prep stations, additional sensors and controls, solar and natural gas energy solutions, security systems, custom colors and graphics, multiple pod connections, means of stacking GrowPods, modular additions, clean rooms and specialized shelf systems.



GrowPods use both indoor organic hydroponic and soil-based systems to provide plants with nutrients, water and oxygen. LED lights installed in GrowPods are adjustable and can create the specific spectrum and intensity that is optimal for the growth of a particular crop. Automated monitoring equipment enables maintenance of the proper level and mixture of nutrients and a precise growing environment. A GrowPod can grow some plants up to five times faster than traditional farming.



Using GrowPods, growers can use physical space, water and other resources more efficiently, while enjoying year-round and more rapid growth cycles, as well as more predictable and abundant yields, compared with traditional farming.



Some of GrowPods’ advantages over traditional farming are:




● | Productivity. GrowPods provide substantially more productivity. For example, a GrowPod can produce approximately 2,000 heads of lettuce every 55 days, compared with 4,000 heads per year for the same ground area for traditional farming. Because GrowPods can be stacked (up to five containers high), productivity for each square foot of ground space can be multiplied by a factor of five. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potentially lower operating costs. The operating costs of GrowPods are potentially lower than for traditional farming because water is reused, nutrients are concentrated and their amounts precisely measured, and no pesticides are needed. No labor for tilling, weeding or crop protection is required and operation is automated. While annual operation costs for a GrowPod vary, we believe that the average is approximately $18,000 per year (including electricity, water and growing supplies).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Climate insensitivity. GrowPods are unaffected by the outside elements. For example, crops can be grown in a GrowPod year-round in cold areas, reducing the costs of transporting food. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No pesticides. Because the controlled environment of GrowPods prevents pests, no insecticide is required. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Location versatility. GrowPods can be installed in buildings, warehouses, garages and parking lots, close to the market for their crops, saving transportation costs and enhancing freshness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ease of moving. GrowPods can easily be moved as the needs of their owners may require. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Better food. Food grown hydroponically has better product safety, quality and consistency. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced transportation costs. GrowPods permit farming operations to be located significantly closer to end-users, thereby reducing transportation distance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced food waste. Since GrowPods permit food production significantly closer to end-users, there is less time between harvesting and consumption, and therefore, reduced product spoilage, damage and waste. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Chemical runoff prevention. Due to the closed-loop systems used in GrowPods, there is a nature of significantly decreased risk of chemical runoff, which is generally more difficult to control in traditional farming. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




While GrowPods offer savings in labor, material and space, they require a substantial amount of electrical energy, the cost of which is sometimes higher than that of petroleum-based power that is commonly utilized in traditional farming. We believe that this is offset by the fact that plants may be grown in urban areas and in inhospitable climates, thereby reducing transportation times and costs and enhancing freshness. High energy costs tend to increase the cost of commonly grown crops, such as lettuce, herbs and spices; however, as the value of a crop increases, the cost of energy tends to become a less important consideration.

Growing Media and Nutrients



In 2021, we began to sell products that are used to improve the efficiency of the agricultural growing and the cultivation process. Growing media consists of premium soils and soil alternatives, such as perlite, gravel, rock wool, coconut coir or clay pebbles, used in hydroponic cultivation. We sell some of these products under the names “Prolific Soilless Growth Medium” and “Prolific Fertilizer.”
Other Supplies



In 2021, we began to sell high-efficiency LED lighting, electronically controlled irrigation systems, humidifiers and growing panels as replacement parts and upgrades.



The Market for GrowPods



The Expanding Hydroponics Market



Hydroponics is an increasingly significant and fast-growing component of the expanding global commercial agriculture sector. The Company believes that hydroponics will be used increasingly as a farming technique, especially for cannabis. According to the USDA, farm output was $136.1 billion in the U.S. alone in 2019, and according to New Frontier Data, the market for legal cannabis in the U.S. in that year was $13.2 billion, with an additional $13.5 billion of illegal cannabis. As indicated below, we expect the market for legal cannabis to grow dramatically.



According to industry publications, revenue for the global hydroponics industry, of which container-based systems such as GrowPods are a significant part, totaled approximately $65 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% from 2019 to 2023. According to these publications, the global wholesale hydroponic equipment and supplies industry totaled approximately $8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.8% from 2019 to 2025. The Company believes that rapid growth in demand for hydroponically grown crops will increase demand for GrowPods.




We believe that the growth in the demand for GrowPods and related products will be driven by a broad array of factors, including:




Significant Growth in the Cannabis Industry



We believe that a majority of GrowPods and supplies is purchased by participants in the cannabis industry. The U.S. cannabis industry is massive and growing, driven mainly by state-level legalization efforts, which are discussed below. Management believes that these legalization efforts and increasing popular support will continue to increase the size of the U.S. cannabis market for many years: according to an industry publication, legal cannabis sales in the United States grew approximately 30% over $18 billion in 2020, and are expected to surpass $28 billion in 2022 and reach approximately $46 billion in 2026. We believe that the current and expected growth in the size of the cannabis market has had and will continue to have a very significant positive impact on sales of our hydroponic equipment and supplies.



Several developments have contributed to an increase in cannabis availability and use, including the proliferation of cannabidiol (“CBD”) and other cannabis-infused products, including edibles, oils, tinctures, and topical treatments. We believe that the historical stigmatization of cannabis use has diminished significantly, as the result of a more supportive legislative environment, a change in sociopolitical views and greater consumer awareness of possible health benefits of cannabis. According to industry publications, real and perceived health benefits extend into areas including cancer treatment, pain management, the treatment of neurological and mental conditions, and sleep management.



Significant growth in the U.S. cannabis market is expected to continue due to (i) further initiatives for adult use and/or medical-use programs in additional U.S. states, (ii) expanded access for patients or consumers in existing state medical or adult-use cannabis programs, and (iii) increased consumption driven by greater product diversity and choice, reduced stigma, and real and perceived health benefits in states with existing adult-use or medical use programs.



Initiatives for new adult-use or medical-use programs.




As of the date of this report, 18 U.S. states and the District of Columbia had legalized cannabis for adult and medical use; 10 states had legalized cannabis for medical use and decriminalized its adult use; nine states had legalized cannabis for medical use only; two states had decriminalized it, at least in small amounts; and its possession and use was illegal in four states. In contrast, in 1996 and 2004, cannabis was legal for medical use in one and four states, respectively, and otherwise unlawful, and in 2014, was lawful for adult use in four states and for medical use in 18 states.



We believe support for cannabis legalization in the U.S. is gaining momentum. According to a November 2019 poll by Pew Research Center, public support for the legalization of cannabis in the U.S. increased from approximately 41% in 2010 to approximately 67% in 2019. According to a 2019 poll by Quinnipiac University, 93% of Americans support patient access to medical-use cannabis if recommended by a doctor. Furthermore, due to recent socioeconomic changes across the U.S. since early 2020, many state governments are seeking additional revenue sources, such as potential revenue streams from the taxation and job creation that state-legalized adult-use cannabis may offer. Accordingly, several states are considering implementing laws permitting cannabis use or further liberalizing their existing laws permitting such use. A number of bills that, to varying extents, would legalize the cultivation, use and possession of cannabis at the federal level have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, but none has been adopted by both of its houses.





5







Expanded access for patients and consumers in existing state medical and adult-use programs.



We believe that the cannabis business in states that have legalized cannabis will continue to grow, creating jobs and opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs, and that cultivators, manufacturers, dispensaries, delivery providers, labs and other cannabis-related businesses will continue to grow in these regions. As these businesses proliferate, we believe that demand for GrowPods will increase.



Greater product diversity and choice, reduced stigma and real and perceived health benefits in states with existing adult-use or medical use programs.



Several key developments have contributed to increased cannabis product availability and breadth, including the proliferation of CBD and other cannabis-infused products, such as edibles, oils, tinctures, and topical treatments. As stated above, we believe that the historical stigmatization of cannabis has diminished significantly. According to industry publications, real and perceived health benefits extend into areas including cancer treatment, pain management, the treatment of neurological and mental conditions, and sleep management. According to industry publications, the use of cannabis in the U.S. by adults aged over 65 has increased from 0.4% in 2006 and 2.9% in 2015 to 4.2% in 2018.



Acceleration of Hydroponics Use



Both the commercial agriculture and cannabis industries are increasingly adopting more advanced agricultural technologies in order to enhance productivity and efficiency. This trend continues to increase globally, driven by the factors listed above as well as growth in fruit and vegetable farming, consumer gardening and the continued adoption of vertical farming. Vertical farming, which involves the stacking of GrowPods, has gained popularity mainly due to its advantage of maximizing yield per unit of ground area by growing crops in layers. Industry publications project that the global vertical farming market will reach approximately $6 billion in 2023, up from $3 billion in 2019, representing a 24% CAGR.



We believe that hydroponics is and will continue to be the primary method of growing cannabis, driving demand for our GrowPods and related products. The movement toward the legalization of cannabis in the U.S. comes with a corresponding increase in regulatory oversight and statutory requirements for growers and their products. These regulations not only enhance product safety and transparency to consumers, but also usually necessitate the use of hydroponics in cannabis cultivation in order to meet mandated THC content or impurity tolerances.



Strong Demand for Hemp for CBD Production



Hemp cultivation in the United States has grown significantly since the passage of the U.S. Farm Bill in December 2018. Consumers are increasingly using hemp-derived products such as CBD for their therapeutic benefits. According to industry publications, the U.S. CBD market is expected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2019 to $6.9 billion in 2025, representing a 6-year CAGR of 33.8%. We believe that there is a market for GrowPods from growers of hemp.



Competitive Strengths



We believe that we are an increasingly successful seller of container-based hydroponic systems in the U.S. We believe that there are approximately 20 companies that sell or resell products similar to GrowPods in the United States, including manufacturers of such systems who sell their products directly, but we are unable to ascertain our relative position among them. We serve several attractive end markets, including hemp and indirectly, the cannabis industry. GP is an independent producer of container-based hydroponic systems. The Company believes that it is positioned to become a leading competitor by market share in the market for container-based hydroponic growing spaces, which it believes is a unique category of such spaces. Its mission is to provide small- to medium-sized growers, farmers and cultivators with a product that enables greater quality, efficiency, consistency and speed in growing their crops than traditional farming.




We believe that we can take advantage of favorable trends in hydroponics, including increased adoption of vertical farming methods to increase yields, are projected to drive a 24% CAGR for the vertical farming market through 2023, according to industry publications. Similarly, growers’ increasing preference to reduce water and energy usage, limit pesticide use and risk of environmental runoff and reduce labor costs coupled with growing consumer demand for fruits and vegetables are expected to drive significant growth in hydroponic. Furthermore, hydroponic growing allows farms to be located closer to their consumers, greatly reducing the costs and waste related to transportation and resulting in an overall smaller carbon footprint. We expect to see the most significant growth in cannabis. We believe that increased support for cannabis legalization at the federal level in the U.S., an increase in U.S. states’ legalization of adult-use and medical cannabis and consumer and commercial awareness of the benefits associated with hemp-derived products will drive continued growth.




Growers can benefit from macroeconomic factors that we believe will drive demand for GrowPods – as single units or stacked – as well as the growth in cannabis, hemp and other end-markets. As the population grows and urbanizes, we expect vertical farming to be increasingly used to meet the demand for these crops. Industry publications estimate that the global vertical farming market will expand at a 24% CAGR from 2019 to 2023. In addition, the U.S. and Canadian markets for legal cannabis had an estimated value of approximately $14 billion in 2019 and are projected to grow to approximately $37 billion by 2024. The hemp market has benefited from consumer adoption of hemp-derived CBD products. According to industry publications, the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market is expected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2019 to $6.9 billion in 2025, representing a six-year CAGR of 33.8%. We expect that these favorable growth trends will continue to increase demand for GrowPods.

The Distributorship Agreement



Under the Distributorship Agreement, ACT has the exclusive right to acquire GrowPods and related products at prices to be agreed to from time to time and to sell and distribute them within the United States and its territories, and ACT is obligated to use its best efforts to sell them. The Distributorship Agreement has an initial term that will expire on December 31, 2025. ACT may renew the Distributorship Agreement indefinitely as long as it purchases the lesser of (i) 100 GrowPods or (ii) GP’s total output of GrowPods in the last calendar year of any term. GrowPods and related items are shipped directly to our purchasers by GP. In the event that ACT fails to pay GP’s invoices within 30 days of ACT’s receipt of GP’s products and such default continues unremedied for 15 days after ACT’s receipt of written notice thereof, GP may terminate the Distributorship Agreement on written notice. In the event that GP is in default of its obligations to deliver its products and such default continues unremedied for 15 days after its receipt of written notice thereof, ACT may terminate the Agreement on written notice. GP provides a limited warranty that its products will be free of defects in materials and workmanship upon their delivery and for 1 year thereafter.



ACT began purchasing GrowPods from GP in the first quarter of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, ACT purchased 40 GrowPods from GP, which was its total output during that year.



The Company believes that the Covid-19 Pandemic has not affected GP’s ability to perform its obligations under the Distributorship Agreement.



The Medtainer and Related Products



Medtainers are manufactured from medical-grade polypropylene resin. They can store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids, can grind solids and shred herbs and are air- and water-tight. The Company sells the original 20-dram version, a 20-dram version that has received child safety certification, and a 40-dram version. The Company is focusing its marketing of Medtainers on the drug stores and drug store chains, cannabis/CBD markets, veterinarians and veterinary distributors and other distributors and end-users.

 

During the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Company received revenues of $1,016,548 and $1,172,278, respectively, from sales of Medtainers and related products.



Medtainers have three components. The top component is a cap, the middle component is a storage cup with grinding/shredding teeth projecting downward from its bottom and the bottom component is a grinding/shredding cup with teeth projecting upward from its bottom. Material is transferred from the storage cup into the grinding/shredding cup, the storage cup is inserted into the grinding/shredding cup, forming a space in which the two sets of teeth intermesh, and the two cups are then rotated manually such that the material passes between the two sets of teeth and is ground or shredded. The ground or shredded material may then be returned to the storage cup for storage or used or dispensed in another manner. The cap attaches to the grinding/shredding cup such that the storage cup is held between them, forming a compact unit that is air- and water-tight between the cap and the storage cup, as well as between the storage cup and the bottom cup. The pictures below show exploded views of the non-childproof and childproof configurations of the Medtainer.








On June 8, 2018, the Company acquired the patents and patent applications relating to the Medtainer patents, the trademark “Medtainer” and a related domain name from Polymation, LLC (“Polymation”), agreed with Polymation to terminate the agreement under which the Company purchased Medtainers from Polymation, licensed Polymation to manufacture Medtainers solely for purchase by the Company under these patents and entered into a production contract, dated June 8, 2018, which was amended on March 27, 2019, under which Polymation manufactures and the Company purchases Medtainers (as so amended, the “Production Contract”). The Production Contract requires the Company to purchase at least 30,000 units per month, increasing by 1% on each anniversary of its effective date, and sets prices for the products purchased thereunder, subject to periodic increases for changes in the local consumer-price index. Its term expires on April 30, 2031, unless the Company exercises a termination option, under which it may terminate the Production Contract upon payment to Polymation of $400,000, less any amount that its owner agrees that he owes to the Company or that he owes to it under a final and unappealable judgment, provided that the shares of Common Stock issued to him in the transaction in which the Company acquired the patent and trademark may be publicly sold under the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) afforded by Rule 144 promulgated thereunder or another exemption from such registration.





7







Because the Company owns the patent for the Medtainer, to the extent that it can sell more Medtainers than it is required to purchase under the Production Contract, it will be able to manufacture them in-house or acquire them from a third party, possibly at prices lower than under the Production Contract, but unless the number of Medtainers that the Company is not required to purchase under the Production Contract is substantial, doing so may not be cost-effective. The Company intends to continue its efforts to sell Medtainers globally, which, if successful, would increase demand for Medtainers and could increase sales volume, with the result that the Company might produce them at its facilities or seek out a third party to manufacture them, instead of purchasing them from Polymation, if doing either were cost-effective. The Company presently has no suppliers other than Polymation for Medtainers.



The Company believes that the raw materials used by Polymation in manufacturing Medtainers are readily available.



The Company believes that the Covid-19 Pandemic has not affected Polymation’s ability to perform its obligations under the Production Agreement.



Other Products



In addition to Medtainers, the Company sells and is actively developing markets for the following products, all of which it purchases from their manufacturers and resells:

● | Humidity Control Inserts. These inserts are placed into air- and water-tight containers, such as humidors and Medtainers, to maintain humidity by adding or removing moisture. These inserts are of varying sizes and capable of maintaining various ranges of relative humidity, depending on the specifications of each particular insert. The Company purchases inserts from Boveda Inc. and Desiccare, Inc. and markets them under the Boveda or Desiccare label. The Company also has an agreement with Desiccare for the Company to market private label inserts under the name “MED X 2 Way Humidity Control Pack” and markets some of the inserts it purchases from Desiccare under its private label. The Company believes that marketing inserts under its own label is significant in that many of its Medtainer products are now being sold with humidity packs inserted into the containers and that this “value-added” factor has increased demand for this product.

● | Lighters. The Company sells butane lighters with and without logos and other markings. The Company adds logos and markings based on customers’ specifications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




During the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Company received revenues of $921,383 and $829,875, respectively, from sales of these products.



Printing



The Company entered the custom labeling business in 2015 because some of its customers desired to have custom labels imprinted on the products that they purchased from the Company and the Company found that the cost of doing so through third parties raised the price that it charged to customers for imprinted products to levels that it believed would impede sales. Labeling is performed using five specialized printers that can print on nonporous plastic. Currently, about 2,000 square feet are devoted to printing. The Company is seeking additional business from companies that require labeling on their products.




During the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Company received revenues of $48,999 and $44,409, respectively, from this business.



Sales and Distribution



The Company sells all GrowPods and related products to end-users. Approximately 98% of Medtainers and related products are sold to wholesalers and distributors, who resell them to businesses and consumers, with and without custom labeling; the remainder are sold directly to retail consumers through internet sales and at trade shows. The Company has a showroom for GrowPods in Tulsa, Oklahoma.



The Company believes that social media are important to marketing its products and it maintains a presence on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and other social media.



The Company believes that it is important to maintain strong relationships with its direct customers and its distributors, and, where possible, their customers, and takes measures to do so.

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property



GrowPods and Related Products



GP has not registered “GrowPod” or the names of related products as trademarks under federal or state law. The Company does not believe that these names are material to its success in selling these products.
The Medtainer



The Company owns patents and patent applications relating to the Medtainer, the trademark “Medtainer” and a related internet domain. While the Medtainer is patented, similar products are being manufactured and sold, and the Company has not determined whether these products conflict with the Medtainer patents; however, if it determines that a conflict exists, it takes measures to enforce its patents. The Company does not know to what extent these products have affected its business.



The Company may license the Medtainer patents and trademark to, and future patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from, third parties.



The Company employs various methods, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, to protect its trade secrets and know-how. As it develops new products, the Company will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, unpatented know-how, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect its proprietary rights. The Company cannot presently ascertain the extent to which other intellectual property that it may develop, or license will be important to it.



Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights we own or license. We have not sought to register every one of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property in every country in which we sell Medtainers. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States with respect to our patents and trademarks. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights and protect our proprietary information or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or services infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property or proprietary rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.



We may need to obtain licenses to patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products, if, for example, we seek to develop our products, in conjunction with any patented technology. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms (or at all) and maintain these licenses, our ability to commercially market our products may be inhibited or prevented.



Employees



Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the Company had, in addition to its two executive officers, nine sales personnel, three administrative personnel and four print technicians and warehouse personnel in connection with its Medtainer business. Due to the pandemic, the Company reduced its employees, in addition to its two executive officers, to one print technician and three sales personnel. The Company does not expect to increase staffing for its Medtainer business in the foreseeable future. The Company sells GrowPods through independent contractors who receive commissions based on sales. The Company believes that it needs to offer competitive salaries and incentives to attract and retain personnel who will enable it to expand its business and provide internal services. While it is exploring ways of doing so, its ability to offer attractive compensation is dependent upon its attaining profitability.
Competition



The Company operates in highly competitive industries. There are numerous manufacturers, distributors and resellers of small containers, which include metal, glass, resin, plastic, paper and other packaging materials, while the Company believes that there are about 20 manufacturers, distributors and resellers of container-based hydroponic systems. These competitors are of varying sizes and include Freight Farms, Inc., Micro Lab Farms, Vertical Harvest LLC Freight Farms, Inc. and Greentech Agro LLC with respect to GrowPods; and national and local distributors and manufacturers of hydroponic equipment, nutrients and growing media, such as Maxigrow Ltd., Hydrotek Hydroponics Ltd., Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc., The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company and Wholesale Hydroponic Supplies. We also face competition from smaller regional competitors who operate in many of the areas where we compete. Most of the Company’s existing and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and their products may enjoy greater market acceptance among its potential customers. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution, service and other resources than does the Company and may be more able to adapt quickly to customers’ changing demands and changes in technology, to enhance existing products, to develop and introduce new products and new production technologies and to respond timely changing market conditions and customer demands. If the Company is not able to compete successfully in the face of its competitors’ advantages, its ability to gain market share or market acceptance for its products could be limited, its revenues and profit margins could suffer and it might never become profitable. Additionally, if demand for our products continues to increase due to the growth of the cannabis and industrial hemp industries, new competitors may enter the market. The Company believes that the barriers to entry to distributing products similar to those that it resells and to their manufacture are relatively low.

Competitive factors for the products that we market are product quality, brand awareness, product performance, value, reputation, price and advertising. The Company believes that it currently competes effectively with respect to each of these factors.



Government Regulation



The Company’s GrowPod business is affected by laws and regulations relating to cannabis, as set forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors. The Company sells products that may be used for cannabis-related purposes. While there is no national governmental regulation relating to the sale of hydroponics equipment, certain products included in our growing media and nutrients product line are subject to certain registration requirements with some U.S. state regulators and federal regulations. The Company intends to obtain the requisite licenses to sell these where required. Its products include growth media and nutrients that contain ingredients that are subject to regulation by various agencies in some jurisdictions. A decision by a regulatory agency to significantly restrict the use of such products could have an adverse impact on firms from which the Company purchases these products and on the end-users of these products, and as a result, limit its ability to sell them.



The Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regulates the material content of Medtainers, including the medical-grade polypropylene resin used in their manufacture, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) regulates certain aspects of these products pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall these products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which the Company sells or intends to sell its products. In addition, certain state laws restrict the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals and impose fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although FDA-approved resins and pigments are used in its products that directly contact food and drugs and the Company believes that Medtainer products are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements (although the Company is not required to submit these or any other products to the FDA or the CPSC for review), the Company is subject to the risk that these products could be found not to be compliant with these and/or other requirements. A recall of any of these products or any fines and penalties imposed in connection with noncompliance could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.



The Company and its expenditures, earnings and competitive position have not been materially affected by compliance with the above or other governmental regulations, including those relating to climate change. See also Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Climate Change.




The Company believes that it is in compliance with all material government regulations.



Cybersecurity



The Company does not believe that it is subject to material cybersecurity risks and does not expect to incur material costs in connection with cybersecurity. The Company does not believe that it has been the object of any cyberattack.
