Impact of COVID-19 and Oil and Gas Market Volatility
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business shutdowns and restrictions on the movement of people in the United States and abroad. 
During 2020, the global economy experienced substantial turmoil which led to challenging market conditions across certain areas of the Company’s business. Due to unprecedented decreases in demand, an oil price war, and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, average crude oil prices were considerably lower in 2020 as compared to 2019. However, since May 2020 through the date of this 2020 Annual Report, crude oil prices have increased. A significant portion of the Company’s sales and profitability is derived from the sale of products that are used within the oil and gas industry. While the Company did not experience significant supply chain interruptions or material cancellations of orders during 2020, the Company did see a decline in orders and lower volumes compared to the prior year. In early 2021, the Company experienced delays in its supply chain due to temporary shortages of raw materials and container delays of overseas materials as bottlenecks occurred at ports in Asia and North America. This, in turn, has caused delivery delays to some of the Company’s customers. The Company is also experiencing inflationary cost pressures for certain materials and is working to mitigate the impact through price increases and other measures, where possible. The potential for continued disruptions, economic uncertainty, inflationary cost pressures, and unfavorable oil and gas market dynamics may have a material adverse impact on the timing of 
delivery of customer orders and the levels of future customer orders. Accordingly, these challenges may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s future results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
These factors, in turn, may not only continue to impact the Company’s operations, financial condition and demand for the Company’s goods and services, but its overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of these events. The timing and execution of the strategic initiatives and growth strategies discussed below may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic including the related oil and gas market dynamics.
Strategic Initiatives/Growth Strategies
The Company has initiated a comprehensive set of business objectives aimed at improving profitability, streamlining processes, strengthening the business and focusing on achieving growth in higher-return product lines. Key elements of these objectives and other initiatives are highlighted below.
Improve profitability
The Company has implemented a plan focused on enhancing profitability through the review of its customer and product portfolio. To date, this has resulted in strategic price increases in certain areas of the business, along with product redesign and the re-sourcing of certain components, to support improved margins. This program is a multi-year effort and will entail a strategic assessment of certain areas in which profitability does not meet established thresholds. The Company also continues to transform its manufacturing operations through the ongoing adoption of lean, agile and flexible lines, which provides opportunities for improved efficiency, margins and profitability, particularly as volume and sales improve. It has also been investing heavily in the expansion of its heavy-duty engine product line, which has historically provided better margins. Further, the Company is in the early phases of production of certain products and anticipates potential benefits as it gains improved economies of scale through greater volumes. Lastly, from mid-2016 through mid-2020, the Company incurred substantial costs related to its restatement of prior financial statements. The Company saw a meaningful reduction in professional services fees related to the Company’s efforts to restate prior period financial statements and prepare, audit and file delinquent financial statements with the SEC with the completion of the restatement of its prior financial statements in May 2019 and the filing of all delinquent periodic reports in June 2020. However, the Company continues to incur substantial legal costs related to these matters, including for its obligations to indemnify past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees with respect to the investigations conducted by the SEC and the criminal division of the USAO, which will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources due to the exhaustion of its historical primary directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage. The Company also continues to incur costs related to the remediation of the deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting and for the enhancement of its corporate compliance program pursuant to the Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) with the USAO. Upon the conclusion of these matters, the Company expects to see its expenses decline. 
Warranty expense mitigation efforts
The Company aims to curtail its warranty expense through various mitigation efforts.  As part of this, the Company is developing reimbursement and commercial remedies from key suppliers, where applicable.  Also, the Company is undergoing a continued evaluation and improvement of its engineering validation and reliability programs for products and applications.  The Company also continues to make investments in technology to further enhance its tools and processes.
Streamlining of business processes
The Company has an ongoing program to review and identify cost reductions throughout the organization. As part of this program, the Company continues to adopt tighter controls, monitors major areas of spending and is centralizing certain business processes. 
Strengthen the business through the optimization of business systems and technology
The Company is working to strengthen its business through the optimization of its business systems and technology to support the remediation of internal controls, improve processes, drive greater operational efficiencies and provide better and timelier decision making across the organization. As part of this initiative, the Company is working on the reimplementation of its Enterprise Resource Planning system.
Grow the business in the highest return on investment areas
The Company has been a major participant in the energy market for many years as a supplier to several of the world’s leading power generation companies and through its large custom Generator Set (“Genset”) enclosure business. Building on its broad product offering, in March 2018, October 2018, and October 2019, the Company received EPA certification for its 32L, 40L, and 53L heavy-duty engines, respectively. These heavy-duty engines provide a natural-gas-fueled power range from 500 kilowatt-electric (“kWe”) to 1.25 megawatt (“MW”), which is well above the Company’s prior capabilities, allowing it to serve a greater portion of the demand response, microgrid, combined heat and power, and oil and gas markets. Additionally, in 
September 2019, the Company received EPA emergency standby certification for its 20L, 40L and 53L diesel engines, which provide a power range of 550 kWe to 1.65 MW. These diesel engines are largely designed for energy market applications including emergency power, wastewater treatment, and oil and gas exploration and production. Also, the engines can handle mission critical customer operations in the health care, data center, hospitality and transportation industries. In addition to dedicating significant R&D resources within the energy market, the Company has also strategically invested in expanding its management, sales and operations staff to support these efforts. The Company’s heavy-duty engines have historically provided better margins.
Capitalize on key market trends
The Company’s breadth of products and solutions will enable it to capitalize on numerous market trends that it believes have the potential to drive customer demand for its products and contribute toward its long-term growth. Further, the Company’s R&D activity is largely focused on expanding its solutions to further address trends in these areas. The key trends include the following:
•the worldwide growth of intermittent sources of energy, such as wind and solar, and an aged electric grid in the United States, coupled with power outage activity due to weather or power shutdowns, which is driving increased demand for generators, microgrids and demand response equipment; 
•increasingly stringent regulations and growing efforts to reduce emissions, which are driving demand for clean energy and alternatives to diesel power engines (e.g., EPA Tier 4 emission standards, CARB regulations, MEE policies in China, and grants, rebates and other incentives for adopting clean energy applications), in particular, in several markets such as the power generation market for microgrids and oil and gas applications, school bus and arbor care market, among others;
•growth in datacenters and their increasing demand for electricity, which is driving growth for backup power (commercial generators/microgrids);
•growth in e-commerce activity around the world, which is driving demand for last-mile delivery vehicles; and
•the availability of automotive engines that are suited for industrial application.
New product expansion by leveraging deep industry experience
Throughout the Company’s history, it has evolved from a provider of diesel power systems to become a major supplier of power systems fueled by alternatives to diesel, including gasoline, propane, and natural gas, among others. By leveraging the deep industry experience of its engineering and new-product development teams, the Company is continuing to take steps to broaden the range of its power system product offerings, including engine classes, power ratings and the OEM and direct user market categories into which it supplies products. The Company plans to capitalize on its technologically sophisticated, in-house design, prototyping, testing and application engineering capabilities to further refine its superior power system technology.
Leverage the Company’s relationship with Weichai
In March 2017, the Company executed a share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with Weichai America Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Weichai Power Co., Ltd. (HK2338, SZ000338) (herein collectively referred to as “Weichai”). Under the terms of the SPA, Weichai invested $60.0 million in the Company (the “Weichai Transactions”) by purchasing a combination of newly issued Common Stock and preferred stock, par value $0.001 (the “Preferred Stock”), as well as a stock purchase warrant, which significantly strengthened the Company’s financial condition and contributed to the extinguishment of its $60.0 million term loan in 2017. The Company and Weichai also entered into a strategic collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) under which they have been working together to accelerate market opportunities for each company’s respective product lines across various geographic and end-user markets.
The Collaboration Agreement provides the Company with strategic benefits and opportunities, including the ability to leverage Weichai’s strengths and capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, procurement and distribution and its widespread sales channels in China and other emerging markets. This collaboration has enabled the Company to broaden its existing product portfolio, improve material quality, decrease costs, accelerate the development of new products and bring them to market, and expand access and exposure to new markets.
Among other things, the Collaboration Agreement establishes a joint steering committee, permits Weichai to second a limited number of certain technical, marketing, sales, procurement and finance personnel to work at the Company and establishes several collaborations, including with respect to stationary natural gas applications and Weichai diesel engines. The Collaboration Agreement also provides for the steering committee to create different subcommittees with various operating roles, and it otherwise governs the treatment of intellectual property of the parties prior to the collaboration and the intellectual property developed during the collaboration. The Collaboration Agreement had a term of three years that was set to expire in March 2020. On March 26, 2020, the Collaboration Agreement was extended for an additional term of three years.
The Weichai stock purchase warrant, as last amended (the “Weichai Warrant”), was exercisable commencing on April 1, 2019 for such number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock as was sufficient to provide Weichai with majority ownership of the Company’s Common Stock. On April 23, 2019, Weichai exercised the Weichai Warrant resulting in the Company issuing 4,049,759 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information–Stock Ownership and Control in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Information, for additional information. Weichai is currently the Company’s majority stockholder, holding over 51% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, as of March 12, 2021. 
Expand global business
Through the expansion of its product lineup and the entry into new markets, the Company has a history of growing its product offerings internationally beyond North America. The Company sees long-term opportunity in continuing to grow its business worldwide with further R&D investment including new-product development and offerings.
Strengthened engine development and testing capability
In April 2018, the Company acquired the assets of Chicago Technical Center R&D facility from Ricardo, Inc. This transaction has allowed the Company to significantly strengthen and expand its testing capabilities and increase its capacity to meet current and future engine development, certification and durability testing needs. The advanced R&D facility immediately provided three strategic benefits for the corporate engine programs: (i) increased speed to market response, (ii) greater ability to innovate and optimize product performance and reliability, and (iii) lower cost of product development through direct control of in-house EPA and CARB-certified testing cell operations, scheduling and management of the industry-leading engine testing center.
Sales and Marketing
The Company employs a direct sales and marketing approach to maintain maximum interface with and service support for its OEM customers. This direct interface incorporates the corporate internal technical sales representatives. The Company complements its direct OEM relationships with a localized, independent sales and product support organization. This localized sales and support organization provides the necessary knowledge of local customs and requirements while also delivering immediate sales assistance and customer support.
The Company has invested in and is focused on capturing aftermarket sales of the value-added components that are included in its power systems. With a significant portion of the selling prices of the Company’s power systems coming from value-added components, this is a large, continuing growth opportunity for its aftermarket business.
Customers
The Company’s customers primarily include global OEMs and direct end-users across a wide range of applications that demand high product quality, best-in-class engineering support and on-time delivery. Within several applications for which the Company provides solutions, it maintains supplier relationships with two or more customers, which are often among the largest in that category.
The Company’s largest customers, based upon its consolidated net sales in 2020, included the following subsidiaries/affiliates of Daimler AG: Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Thomas Built Buses and FUSO Company (collectively, “Freightliner”) and Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Group. Freightliner and Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Group represented 11% and 14% of 2020 consolidated net sales, respectively. The largest customers change from time to time as a result of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, customers’ strategies and inventory of the Company’s power systems.
Competition
In each of the Company’s end markets there are a variety of competitors, including engine manufacturers, independent suppliers and distributors of engines, fuel systems and component providers, manufacturers of power generation equipment, engine packagers and integrators, and the in-house operations of certain OEMs, some of which have longer operating histories, strong brand recognition and significantly greater financial and marketing resources.
Notwithstanding significant competition, the Company believes that the following factors provide it with a differentiated value proposition that allows the Company to compete effectively:
•fuel-agnostic strategy;
•demonstrated expertise in on- and off-road applications;
•ability to leverage Weichai’s strengths and capabilities;
•completeness and comprehensiveness of engines and power systems;
•expansive product integrations, including electronics, controls, fuel systems and transmissions;
•commonality of technology platform spanning all product lines;
•emissions regulation compliance and certification;
•breadth and depth of advanced engineering disciplines; 
•industry-leading product and application engineering;
•competitive pricing/cost;
•ability to tailor power systems to specific customer needs;

•speed to market; and
•customer support and service.
Manufacturing
The Company manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Darien, Wisconsin, and customizes its power systems to meet specific requirements of OEM applications and the needs of its OEM customers. The Company has invested in precision computer numerical control (“CNC”) machining equipment to finish its internally designed engine blocks and cylinder heads, which are cast by various suppliers. The manufacturing lines in the Company’s production facilities are technologically sophisticated, lean, agile and flexible, and the Company allocates production capacity on its mixed model manufacturing lines to accommodate the demand levels and product mix required by its OEM customers. 
The Company focuses on safety, people, quality, on-time delivery, cost and environment in its manufacturing operations. The Company is certified to the most recent International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standard, ISO 9001: 2015. The ISO 9000 family of quality management standards, which must be met in order to become ISO certified, is designed to help organizations monitor and improve the quality and delivery of their products and/or services to their customers. The Company also uses tools such as Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, 80/20, Value Stream Mapping and other manufacturing engineering strategies to help manage its business, build quality, and drive performance and a continuous improvement culture within the manufacturing operations’ teams. The Company also uses a customer relationship management database to help collect customer feedback and to track overall quality performance at its OEM customers. Structured staff training is a constant priority and includes closed-loop quality monitoring and feedback systems.
Research, Development and Engineering
The Company’s research, development and engineering programs are focused on new product development, enhancements to current products, quality improvements and material cost reductions across its product lines. Its efforts are market driven, with the sales team identifying and defining market requirements and trends and its engineering and new-product development groups reviewing existing power system portfolios and developing new solutions that build upon the technology within that portfolio.
The Company’s product and application development engineering teams include in-house mechanical and electrical engineering functions. Internal resources are supplemented with engineering outsourcing relationships for design, development and product testing. In addition to these engineering outsourcing relationships, the Company benefits from the design, development and testing capabilities of its supplier base. The Company staffs its engineering support activities associated with released product and component sourcing programs with dedicated internal engineering personnel.
Research, development and engineering expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, information technology and administrative expenses and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, the Company enters into agreements with its customers to fund a portion of the research, development and engineering costs of a particular project. These reimbursements are accounted for as a reduction of the related research, development and engineering expenditure. The Company’s net research, development and engineering expenditures for 2020 and 2019 were $25.4 million and $24.9 million, respectively.
Supplier Relationships
In addition to producing its own engines, the Company has established relationships with its suppliers for certain engines that are integrated into its comprehensive power systems, the most significant of which are Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. (“Doosan”), a subsidiary of Doosan Group, Shenyang Aerospace Mitsubishi Motors Engine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“SAME”), General Motors Company (“GM”) and Weichai. The Company also sources other power system components and coordinates design efforts with third-party suppliers for some of its key components. In general, the prices at which the Company purchases engines, components and other raw materials are based on market factors, including the prices offered by other suppliers operating in the same market and the prevailing market prices of raw materials. 
The Company aggregates product sourcing efforts across its large and diverse OEM customer base and across industry categories, capitalizing on volume, economies of scale and global supply opportunities. The Company’s customers benefit from the aggregation of its global sourcing, procurement, and assembly and services, obtaining cost benefits that they might not obtain if they were to rely on their own internal resources, capabilities and more limited demand requirements. Through this process, customers are able to streamline their supply base by consolidating procurement and assembly efforts down to a single part number product supplied by the Company. The Company delivers this assembly to its customer’s production line ready to install into the customers’ product.
The Company is party to a supply agreement with Doosan, under which it purchases and distributes, on an exclusive basis, specified Doosan engines within a territory consisting of the United States, Canada and Mexico. On October 1, 2019, the supply agreement with Doosan was amended and extended to December 31, 2023, after which the agreement will automatically be extended for additional one-year terms unless a notice of termination is provided by either party six months prior to the scheduled expiration. The addendum also includes minimum product purchase commitments for the period 2019 through 2023, subject to reductions based on market declines in oil prices and defined prescribed payments to Doosan triggered by shortfalls in purchases made by the Company during each annual calendar period. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $0.4 million liability related to a purchasing shortfall of the 2020 volume commitment. See Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statement and Supplemental Information for further discussion. 
The Company had an exclusive third-party supply agreement with GM through December 31, 2019 to purchase and distribute GM 6.0L engines to on-highway customers. With the GM announcement that it will discontinue its production of the GM 6.0L engine, the Company conducted last-time buys of this engine during 2019 and 2020, and anticipates some additional purchases during 2021, to ensure adequate supply to certain transportation customers. The Company does not have a supply agreement with GM for its successor product to the GM 6.0L engine. However, the Company is actively exploring opportunities to identify engine alternatives for this product.
The Company is also party to a supply agreement with SAME through December 31, 2021 for the exclusive purchase and distribution of engines around the world, with the exception of China (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan), within the forklift and marine markets. The agreement, which automatically extends for an additional one-year term on an annual basis, unless either party provides notice of termination at least 180 days before the expiration date, includes minimum purchase commitments.
Product Support
The Company’s dedicated team of product and application engineers enables it to deliver high-quality, responsive technical support to its OEM and end-user customers. The Company provides technical support and training to its customers, including in-plant training and support through web- and phone-based field service. The Company further supports its customers by engaging regional providers to perform warranty services and offer support for its power systems. The Company also leverages its technical resources to provide service and support functions for its power systems sold to OEM customers.
Backlog
Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company’s business.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s workforce consisted of approximately 800 full-time employees. None of the members of the Company’s workforce are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Part of the Company’s values focus on developing and maintaining a world class workforce through personal accountability, teamwork, customer service and innovation. The Company monitors and manages attrition. It approves, through its human resources department, the replacement of key positions that it believes are critical to sustaining improved business performance and analyzes departure data to continually improve upon the experience of employees. Turnover for salaried employees in 2020 was 9.7%. The Company’s talent management and succession planning process includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies, the identification of potential successors, and a plan for talent development.
The Company focuses on attracting and retaining the best employees by providing market competitive pay and benefits. This ensures sustainability of the organization. The Company’s short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to provide a variable pay opportunity to reward the attainment of key financial and operational goals as well as shareholder value creation. In addition to the base and variable pay plans, the Company offers employees other benefits including medical, paid-time off, and retirement savings plans.
Health and safety are also a key priority, as the Company is committed to removing conditions that cause personal injury or occupational illness. Employees participate in trainings sessions focused on these topics and are encouraged to promote behaviors that protect others from risk of injury. The Company sets annual targets for its Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (“DART”) and regularly reviews these metrics. For 2020, the Company achieved an overall TRIR of 2.3, meaning that for every 100 employees, 0.28 employees incurred an injury that resulted in recordable medical treatment. The DART was 2.1 in 2020, meaning that for every 100 employees, 0.26 individuals experienced an incident that resulted in days away from work.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the Company’s customers and communities, the Company made keeping employees safe a priority. Most of the Company’s employees who can work from home have been doing so since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has allowed the Company to focus resources and investments on its R&D and production facilities including the following steps to help protect the health and safety of employees:
•mandatory temperature screenings at plants and facilities for all employees;
•visitor/vendor questionnaires for all non-employees entering the Company’s facilities;
•mandatory personal protective equipment provided for employees;
•masks required inside open plants and facilities;
•redesigned exits, entrances, and production lines to encourage social distancing; and 
•enhanced cleaning protocols before, during, and after shifts.
Impact of Government Regulation
The Company’s power systems are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and noise. The Company’s power systems are subject to compliance with regulatory standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States, including the CARB, and other regulatory agencies around the world, such as the MEE. Since its engines are sold into both off-road and on-road markets, the Company must ensure certification to the specific regulations within the applicable statutory segment. For products sold into the U.S. market, both EPA and CARB have imposed specific regulations on engines used in both off-road equipment and on-road vehicles. These regulations generally serve to restrict exhaust emissions, with a primary focus on oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Exhaust emission regulations for engines used in off-highway industrial and power generation equipment vary based upon the use of the equipment into which the engine is incorporated (such as stationary power generation or mobile off-highway industrial equipment) and the type of fuel used to drive the power system. Similarly, on-road regulations from the EPA and CARB focus on the same exhaust constituents as well as sophisticated requirements to meet on-board diagnostic (“OBD”) system regulations. Emissions of GHGs such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen dioxide are also regulated, with more stringent regulatory requirements starting in 2021. The Company continues to make significant investments into the necessary intellectual property that supports full compliance of the Company’s engines now and into the foreseeable future.
The first EPA emissions regulations adopted for diesel engines, known as Tier 1, applied to diesel engines used in mobile off-highway applications in the U.S., and similar standards for diesel engines, known as Stage I regulations, were implemented thereafter in the EU. The EPA and applicable agencies in the EU have continued to develop emissions regulations for diesel engines in the U.S. and the EU, respectively, and have adopted more restrictive standards. The current diesel engine emission requirements in the U.S are known as Tier 4 and are applicable to off-road diesel engines used in industrial equipment. Similarly, the EU has adopted more restrictive standards under its Stage V regulations. Tier 4 and Stage V regulations call for reductions in levels of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen.
The Company’s entry into the transportation end market began in 2013 with the development of its 8.8L power systems targeted for 2015 regulatory standards. In 2014, the EPA and CARB certified the Company’s new engine as a Model Year 2015 product for liquid propane gas (“LPG”) and compressed natural gas (“CNG”) fuels, and in 2015 the Company launched its first propane-fueled engine for on-road applications. To assist the adoption of alternative-fueled vehicles in the marketplace, the EPA and CARB granted alternative-fueled engines an exemption from OBD regulations until 2018 (CARB)/2019 (EPA). Gasoline engines are not exempt from OBD regulations, therefore, in 2017, the Company achieved full OBD certification for its 2018 and beyond gasoline 6.0L and 8.8L products. The knowledge gained from this gasoline OBD development was applied to the Company’s alternative-fueled engines for 2019 after all OBD exemptions ended as of December 31, 2018. In 2016, the EPA launched new Phase 1 GHG emission regulations. New EPA Phase 2 GHG emission regulations began January 1, 2021.
Historically, the Company’s 6.0L and 8.8L gasoline engines qualified for the small manufacturer exemption for Phase 1 GHG under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulation Section 1036.150(d). Starting in 2020, as a result of the Weichai ownership change in April 2019, those products no longer qualified for the exemption and had to meet Phase 1 GHG standards. In order to address the impact of the transition of its emission regulation requirements in 2020 and 2021, the Company licensed its technology to a third-party small manufacturer to produce and certify the 6.0L gasoline engine and utilized averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions for the sale of its 8.8L gasoline engine. The Company is also utilizing averaging, banking, and trading compliance provisions for compliance with the EPA Phase 2 GHG emission regulations.
The initial and ongoing certification requirements vary by power system application and market segment. Each application must undergo a series of rigorous and demanding tests to demonstrate compliance with regulatory standards, including useful life, zero hours and durability testing. Once a power system is certified, regulatory agencies impose ongoing compliance requirements, which include testing newly produced power systems on a regular quarterly schedule to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, there are field audit requirements, which require the removal of power systems from service at specified stages of their useful lives to perform confirmatory exhaust emissions testing and/or OBD 
system audits and testing. All of the Company’s emission-certified power systems meet existing exhaust emission standards of the EPA and CARB. Failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on the Company’s future financial results.
