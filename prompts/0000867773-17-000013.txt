Residential 
Residential Systems 
We offer a complete set of residential solutions that deliver value to homeowners and our dealer partners. We have developed the capability to deliver AC panels with factory-integrated microinverters. AC system architecture, as compared with DC systems, facilitates direct panel installation, eliminating the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building, driving down system costs, improving overall system reliability, and providing improved, cleaner design aesthetics. As part of our complete solution approach, we offer our Equinox™ residential market product, a fully-integrated solar platform utilizing Maxeon® cells, AC panel architecture, and EnergyLink™ monitoring hardware to combine solar power production and energy management, allowing residential customers to quickly and easily complete their system installations and to ensure always-on connectivity so homeowners can easily access their data anytime, anywhere. The Equinox platform is also sold with our Smart Energy software analytics, which provides our customers with detailed information about their energy consumption and production, enabling them to further reduce their energy costs.
We offer the SunPower® InvisiMount® residential mounting system in our product portfolio. The InvisiMount® system is designed specifically for use with our panels and reduces installation time through pre-assembled parts and integrated grounding. The InvisiMount system is well-suited for residential sloped roof applications and provides design flexibility and enhanced aesthetics by delivering a unique, "floating" appearance. 
We support our hardware development with investments in our proprietary set of advanced monitoring applications (the "SunPower Monitoring System") and our EnergyLink™ customer portal, which enable customers to gain visibility into their solar system production and household energy consumption. This software is available for use on the web or through the SunPower mobile application on smartphones and tablets. In fiscal 2016, we issued nine software upgrades to our EnergyLink customer portal offering and, as a result, have experienced increases in customer traffic, engagement, satisfaction, and referrals.

Sales Channels, Residential Leasing Program and other Financing Options
We sell our residential solar energy solutions to end customers through a variety of means, including cash sales and long-term leases directly to end customers, sales to resellers, including the Company's third-party global dealer network, and sales of the Company's operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services. 
We offer financing programs that are designed to offer customers a variety of options to obtain high efficiency solar products and systems, including loans arranged through our third-party lending partners, in some cases for no money down, or by leasing high efficiency solar systems at competitive energy rates. Our residential lease program, in partnership with third-party investors, provides U.S. customers SunPower systems under 20-year lease agreements that include system maintenance and warranty coverage, including warranties on system performance. SunPower residential lease customers have the option to purchase their leased solar systems upon the sale or transfer of their home. These financing options enhance our ability to provide individually-tailored solar solutions to a broad range of residential customers.
 We also have the ability to sell residential systems to 8point3 Energy Partners LP, a joint Yieldco vehicle in which we have an approximately 37% ownership stake, through transactions in which we sell portfolios of residential leases. For additional information on transactions with 8point3 Energy Partners LP, please see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10. Equity Method Investments" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016.
Commercial
Commercial Roof and Ground Mounted Systems
As part of our complete solution product approach, we offer our Helix™ commercial market product. The Helix system is a pre-engineered, modular solution that combines our industry-leading solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that is built to last and fast to install, enabling customers to scale their solar programs quickly with minimal business disruption. The Helix platform is standardized across rooftop, carport and ground installations and designed to lower system cost while improving performance. The Helix platform is also bundled with our Smart Energy software analytics, which provides our customers with detailed information about their energy consumption and production, enabling them to further reduce their energy costs. 
We also offer a variety of commercial solutions designed to address a wide range of site requirements for commercial rooftop, parking lot and open space applications, including a portfolio of solutions utilizing framed panels and a variety of internally or externally developed mounting methods for flat roof and high tilt roof applications. Our commercial flat rooftop systems are designed to be lightweight and interlock, enhancing wind resistance and providing for secure, rapid installations.
We offer parking lot structures designed specifically for SunPower panels, balance of system components, and inverters and in fiscal 2015 expanded our capability to design and install innovative solar structures and systems for carport applications. These systems are typically custom design-build projects that utilize standard templates and design best practices to create a solution tailored to unique site conditions. SunPower's highest efficiency panels are especially well suited to stand-alone structures, such as those found in parking lot applications, because our systems require less steel and other materials per unit of power or energy produced as compared with our competitors.
Sales Channels and Financing Options
We sell our commercial solar energy solutions to commercial and public entity end customers through a variety of means, including direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") services, sales to our third-party global dealer network and to 8point3 Energy Partners, and sales of our O&M services. We also offer some of our commercial customers alternatives to purchasing systems, such as selling energy to them under power purchase agreements ("PPAs"). 
Power Plants
Power Plant Systems
We offer the industry's first modular solar power block, the Oasis® system, which combines SunPower solar panels and tracker technology into a scalable 1.5 MW solar power block, which streamlines the construction process while optimizing the use of available land by conforming to the contours of the production site. The power block kits are shipped pre-assembled to 
 5

the job site for rapid field installation. The Oasis operating system is designed to support future grid interconnection requirements for large-scale solar power plants, such as voltage ride-through and power factor control. More than 2 GW of the Oasis system is installed or under contract worldwide. The Oasis system was deployed at the 748 MW Solar Star Projects in California, formerly known as Antelope Valley Solar Projects, the world's largest solar power project to date. Our robotic solar power plant cleaning system technology has been deployed on many of the utility-scale solar power systems for which we provide O&M services. The robots may be configured for use with a variety of solar panels and mounting types, including fixed-tilt arrays and single access trackers and significantly reduce water use and improve system performance.
Our single axis tracking systems automatically pivot solar panels to track the sun's movement throughout the day. This tracking feature increases the amount of sunlight that is captured and converted into energy by up to 30% over flat or fixed-tilt systems, depending on geographic location and local climate conditions. A single motor and drive mechanism can control 10 to 20 rows, or more than 200 KW, of solar panels. This multi-row feature represents a cost advantage for our customers over dual axis tracking systems, as such systems require more motors, drives, land, and power to operate per KW of capacity.
Utility-Scale Solar Power System Construction and Development
Our global project teams have established a scalable, fully integrated, vertical approach to constructing and developing utility-scale photovoltaic power plants in a sustainable way. Our industry experienced power plant development and project finance teams evaluate sites for solar developments; obtain land rights through purchase and lease options; conduct environmental and grid transmission studies; and obtain building, construction and grid-interconnection permits, licenses, and regulatory approvals. 
We enter into turnkey EPC agreements with customers under which we design, engineer, construct, commission, and deliver functioning rooftop- and ground-mounted solar power systems. This includes the development, execution, and sale of solar power plants, which generally include the sale or lease of related real estate. Under such development projects, the plants and project development rights, initially owned by us, are later sold to third parties. In the United States, commercial and electric utility customers typically choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with an investor or financing company that buys the system from us. In other areas, such as the Middle East, Africa, and South America, projects are typically purchased by an investor or financing company and operated as central-station solar power plants.
Sales Channels and Financing 
Our power plant business refers to sales of our large-scale solar products and systems, including power plant project development and project sales, EPC services for power plant construction, power plant O&M services and component sales for power plants developed by third parties, sometimes on a multi-year, firm commitment basis.  Our utility-scale solar power systems are typically purchased by an investor or financing company and operated as central-station solar power plants. We also sell utility-scale solar power plants to 8point3 Energy Partners. 
We are able to utilize various means to finance our utility-scale power plant development and construction projects, which include arranging tax equity financing structures, utilizing non-recourse project debt facilities, and executing our HoldCo strategy in conjunction with project sales to 8point3 Energy Partners.
Operations and Maintenance
Our solar power systems are designed to generate electricity over a system life typically exceeding 25 years. We offer our customers various levels of post-installation O&M services with the objective of optimizing our customers' electrical energy production over the life of the system. The terms and conditions of post-installation O&M services may provide for remote monitoring of system production and performance, including providing performance reports, preventative maintenance, including solar module cleanings, corrective maintenance, and rapid-response outage restoration, including repair or replacement of all system components covered under warranty or major maintenance agreements. 
We incorporate leading information technology platforms to facilitate the management of our solar power systems operating worldwide. Real-time flow of data from our customers' sites is aggregated centrally where an engine applies advanced solar specific algorithms to detect and report potential performance issues. Our work management system routes any anomalies to the appropriate responders to help ensure timely resolution. Our performance model, PVSim, was developed over the last 20 years and has been audited by independent engineers. Solar panel performance coefficients are established through independent third-party testing. The SunPower Monitoring System also provides customers real-time performance status of their solar power system, with access to historical or daily system performance data through our customer website (www.sunpowermonitor.com). The SunPower Monitoring System is available through applications on Apple® and Android™ 
 6

devices. Some customers choose to install "digital signs" or kiosks to display system performance information from the lobby of their facility. We believe these displays enhance our brand and educate the public and prospective customers about solar power.
We typically provide a system output performance warranty, separate from our standard solar panel product warranty, to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation O&M services. The system output performance warranty expires upon termination of the post-installation O&M services related to the system. In connection with system output performance warranties, we agree to pay liquidated damages in the event the system does not perform to the stated specifications, with certain exclusions. The warranty excludes system output shortfalls attributable to force majeure events, customer curtailment, irregular weather, and other similar factors. In the event that the system output falls below the warrantied performance level during the applicable warranty period, and provided that the shortfall is not caused by a factor that is excluded from the performance warranty, the warranty provides that SunPower will pay the customer an amount based on the value of the shortfall of energy produced relative to the applicable warrantied performance level. For leased systems, we provide a system output performance warranty with similar terms and conditions as that for non-leased systems.
We calculate our expectation of system output performance based on a particular system’s design specifications, including the type of panels used, the type of inverters used, site irradiation measures derived from historical weather data, our historical experience as a manufacturer, EPC services provider, and project developer as well as other unique design considerations such as system shading. The warrantied system output performance level varies by system depending on the characteristics of the system and the negotiated agreement with the customer, and the level declines over time to account for the expected degradation of the system. Actual system output is typically measured annually for purposes of determining whether warrantied performance levels have been met. 
Our primary remedy for the system output performance warranty is our ongoing O&M services which enable us to quickly identify and remediate potential issues before they have a significant impact on system performance. We also have remedies in the form of our standard product warranties and third-party original equipment manufacturer warranties that cover certain components, such as inverters, to prevent potential losses under our system output performance warranties or to minimize further losses. 
Technology
We believe that we possess a technological advantage as the leading manufacturer of back-contact, back-junction cells that enables our panels to produce more electricity, last longer and resist degradation more effectively. We believe that our technology allows us to deliver:

• | superior performance, including the ability to generate up to 45% more power per unit area than conventional solar cells;


• | superior aesthetics, with our uniformly black surface design that eliminates highly visible reflective grid lines and metal interconnection ribbons;


• | superior reliability, as confirmed by multiple independent reports and internal reliability data;


• | superior energy production per rated watt of power, as confirmed by multiple independent reports; and


• | solar power systems that are designed to generate electricity over a system life typically exceeding 25 years.

With industry-leading conversion efficiencies, we continuously improve our Maxeon® solar cells and believe they perform better and are tested more extensively to deliver maximum return on investment when compared with the products of our competitors. 
Panels
Solar panels are solar cells electrically connected together and encapsulated in a weatherproof panel. Solar cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight into direct current electricity. Our solar cells are designed without highly reflective metal contact grids or current collection ribbons on the front of the solar cell, which provides additional efficiency and allows our solar cells to be assembled into solar panels with a more uniform appearance. Our X-Series solar panels, made with our Maxeon Gen 3 solar cells, have demonstrated panel efficiencies exceeding 22% in high-volume production. In fiscal 2016, one of our standard production modules set a world record for aperture area efficiency as tested by National Renewable Energy Laboratory ("NREL"). We believe our X-Series solar panels are the highest efficiency solar panels available for the mass market, and we continue to focus on increasing cell efficiency even as we produce solar cells with over 25% efficiency in a lab 
 7

setting. Because our solar cells are more efficient relative to conventional solar cells, when our solar cells are assembled into panels, the assembly cost per watt is less because more power can be incorporated into a given size panel. Higher solar panel efficiency allows installers to mount a solar power system with more power within a given roof or site area and can reduce per watt installation costs. Our suite of SunPower solar panels provides customers a variety of features to fit their needs, including the SunPower® Signature™ Black design which allows the panels to blend seamlessly into the rooftop. We offer panels that can be used both with inverters that require transformers as well as with the highest performing transformer-less inverters to maximize output. Both our X-Series and E-Series panels have proven performance with low levels of degradation, as validated by third-party performance tests. Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we launched a new line of solar panels under the Performance Series product name. These products utilize a proprietary manufacturing process to assemble conventional silicon solar cells into panels with increased efficiency and reliability compared with conventional panels. Designed to target a new set of customers and global markets, we expect Performance Series panels to contribute to the growth of all three of SunPower’s business segments.
Balance of System Components
"Balance of system components" are components of a solar power system other than the solar panels, and include mounting structures, charge controllers, grid interconnection equipment, and other devices, depending on the specific requirements of a particular system and project. We possess advanced module-level control electronics in our technology portfolio that enable longer series strings and significant balance of system components cost reductions in large arrays. 
Inverters
Every solar power system needs an inverter to transform the direct current electricity collected from the solar panels into utility-grade AC power that is ready for use. We sell inverters manufactured by third parties, some of which are SunPower-branded. We also have integrated microinverter technology that converts DC generated by a single solar photovoltaic panel into AC directly on the panel. We are utilizing this technology to develop next generation microinverters for use with our high efficiency solar panels. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters perform better in shaded applications compared to conventional string inverters and allow for optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level, enabling maximum energy production by the solar system.
Warranties
SunPower provides a 25-year standard solar panel product warranty for defects in materials and workmanship. The solar panel product warranty also warrants that the panel will provide 95% of the panel’s minimum peak power rating for the first five years, declining due to expected degradation by no more than 0.4% per year for the following 20 years, such that the power output at the end of year 25 will be at least 87% of the panel’s minimum peak power rating. Our warranty provides that we will repair or replace any defective solar panels during the warranty period. We also pass through long-term warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components to customers for periods ranging from five to 20 years. In addition, we generally warrant our workmanship on installed systems for periods ranging up to 25 years.
Smart Energy
We see “Smart Energy” as a way to harness our world’s energy potential by connecting the most powerful and reliable solar systems on the market with an increasingly vast array of actionable data that can help our customers make smarter decisions about their energy use. Our Smart Energy initiative is designed to add layers of intelligent control to homes, buildings and grids—all personalized through easy-to-use customer interfaces. In order to enhance the portfolio of Smart Energy solutions we offer, we continue to invest in integrated technology solutions to help customers manage and optimize their CCOE measurement.
We have an investment in Tendril Networks, Inc. and have licensed its data-driven Energy Services Management Platform. We believe that this open, cloud-based software platform provides the infrastructure, analytics and understanding required to power the development of new Smart Energy applications that will deliver personalized energy services to our residential customers. 
We have also negotiated several agreements with residential and commercial energy storage providers to integrate storage technology into our residential and commercial solar solutions. By combining storage with energy management, we lower our customers' cost of energy through improvements in self-consumption, rate arbitrage, demand management, and grid and market participation. We continue to work to make combined solar and storage solutions broadly commercially available. 
 8

We are developing next generation microinverters for use with our high efficiency solar panels in order to enhance our portfolio of Smart Energy solutions. Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters can convert direct current generated by the solar panel into alternating current, enabling optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system. 
Research and Development
We engage in extensive research and development efforts to improve solar cell efficiency through enhancement of our existing products, development of new techniques, and reducing manufacturing cost and complexity. Our research and development group works closely with our manufacturing facilities, our equipment suppliers and our customers to improve our solar cell design and to lower solar cell, solar panel and system product manufacturing and assembly costs. In addition, we have dedicated employees who work closely with our current and potential suppliers of crystalline silicon, a key raw material used in the manufacture of our solar cells, to develop specifications that meet our standards and ensure the high quality we require, while at the same time controlling costs. Under our Research & Collaboration Agreement with Total, our majority stockholder, we have established a joint committee to engage in long-term research and development projects with continued focus on maintaining and expanding our technology position in the crystalline silicon domain and ensuring our competitiveness. Please see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Research and Development."
Supplier Relationships, Manufacturing, and Panel Assembly
We purchase polysilicon, ingots, wafers, solar cells, balance of system components, and inverters from various manufacturers on both a contracted and a purchase order basis. We have contracted with some of our suppliers for multi-year supply agreements. Under such agreements, we have annual minimum purchase obligations and in certain cases prepayment obligations. Please see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations" for further information regarding the amount of our purchase obligations in fiscal 2017 and beyond. Under other supply agreements, we are required to make prepayments to vendors over the terms of the arrangements. As of January 1, 2017, advances to suppliers totaled $284.8 million. We may be unable to recover such prepayments if the credit conditions of these suppliers materially deteriorate or if we are otherwise unable to fulfill our obligations under these supply agreements. For further information regarding our future prepayment obligations, please see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies—Advances to Suppliers." We currently believe our supplier relationships and various short- and long-term contracts will afford us the volume of material and services required to meet our planned output over the next several years. For more information about risks related to our supply chain, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Supply Chain."
We are working with our suppliers and partners along all steps of the value chain to reduce costs by improving manufacturing technologies and expanding economies of scale. Crystalline silicon is the principal commercial material for solar cells and is used in several forms, including single-crystalline, or monocrystalline silicon, multicrystalline, or polycrystalline silicon, ribbon and sheet silicon, and thin-layer silicon. Our solar cell value chain starts with high purity silicon called polysilicon. Polysilicon is created by refining quartz or sand.

Polysilicon is melted and grown into crystalline ingots and sawed into wafers by business partners specializing in those processes. The wafers are processed into solar cells in our manufacturing facilities located in the Philippines and Malaysia. During fiscal 2016, we substantially completed the construction of the solar cell manufacturing facility that we own and operate in the Philippines. Once fully operational, which is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2017, the facility has a planned annual capacity of 350 MW. The solar cell manufacturing facility we own and operate in Malaysia has a total rated annual capacity of over 800 MW.
We use our solar cells to manufacture our X- and E-series solar panels at our solar panel assembly facilities located in Mexico and France, while we source solar cells from third parties for use in our Performance Series solar panels at our solar panel assembly facility in Mexico. Our solar panel manufacturing facilities have a combined total rated annual capacity of close to 1.9 GW.
We source the solar panels and balance of system components based on quality, performance, and cost considerations both internally and from third-party suppliers. We typically assemble proprietary components, while we purchase generally available components from third-party suppliers. The balance of system components, along with the EPC cost to construct the project, can comprise as much as two-thirds of the cost of a solar power system. Therefore, we focus on standardizing our products with the goal of driving down installation costs, such as with our Equinox, Helix, and SunPower® Oasis® systems.

Customers
We operate in three end-customer segments: (i) Residential Segment, (ii) Commercial Segment and (iii) Power Plant Segment. The Residential and Commercial Segments combined are referred to as Distributed Generation. Our scope and scale allow us to deliver solar solutions across all segments, ranging from consumer homeowners to the largest commercial and governmental entities in the world. Our customers typically include investors, financial institutions, project developers, electric utilities, independent power producers, commercial and governmental entities, production home builders, residential owners and small commercial building owners. We leverage a combination of direct sales as well as a broad partner ecosystem to efficiently reach our global customer base.
We work with development, construction, system integration, and financing companies to deliver our solar power products and solutions to wholesale sellers, retail sellers, and retail users of electricity. In the United States, commercial and electric utility customers typically choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with an investor or financing company that buys the system from us. End-user customers typically pay the investors and financing companies over an extended period of time based on energy they consume from the solar power systems, rather than paying for the full capital cost of purchasing the solar power systems. Our utility-scale solar power systems are typically purchased by an investor or financing company, such as 8point3 Energy Partners, and operated as central-station solar power plants. In addition, our third-party global dealer network and our new homes division have deployed thousands of SunPower rooftop solar power systems to residential customers. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenue" for our significant customers. 
Competition
The market for solar electric power technologies is competitive and continually evolving. In the last year, we faced increased competition, resulting in price reductions in the market and reduced margins, which may continue and could lead to loss of market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to:

• | Residential and Commercial: Canadian Solar Inc., Hanwha Corporation, JA Solar Holdings Co., Kyocera Corporation, LG Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation, NRG Energy, Inc., Panasonic Corporation, Recurrent Energy, Sharp Corporation, SolarWorld AG, Sungevity, Inc., SunRun, Inc., Tesla, Inc., Trina Solar Ltd., Vivint, Inc., and Yingli Green Energy Holding Co.

We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.
In addition, universities, research institutions, and other companies have brought to market alternative technologies, such as thin films, which compete with our technology in certain applications. Furthermore, the solar power market in general competes with conventional fossil fuels supplied by utilities and other sources of renewable energy such as wind, hydro, biomass, solar thermal, and emerging distributed generation technologies such as micro-turbines, sterling engines and fuel cells.
In the large-scale on-grid solar power systems market, we face direct competition from a number of companies, including those that manufacture, distribute, or install solar power systems as well as construction companies that have expanded into the renewable sector. In addition, we will occasionally compete with distributed generation equipment suppliers.
We believe that the key competitive factors in the market for solar systems include:

• | total system price;


• | LCOE evaluation;


• | CCOE evaluation;

 10


• | power efficiency and performance;


• | aesthetic appearance of solar panels and systems;


• | speed and ease of installation through modular solutions such as Oasis and Helix systems;


• | strength of distribution relationships;


• | availability of third-party financing and investments;


• | established sales channels to customers such as 8point3 Energy Partners;


• | timeliness of new product introductions;


• | bankability, strength, and reputation of our company; and


• | warranty protection, quality, and customer service.

We believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each of these elements, although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines, greater technical service and support capabilities, and financial resources. For more information on risks related to our competition, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The increase in the global supply of solar cells and panels, and increasing competition, may cause substantial downward pressure on the prices of such products and cause us to lose sales or market share, resulting in lower revenues, earnings, and cash flows."
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights. "SunPower" and the "SunPower" logo are our registered trademarks in countries throughout the world for use with solar cells, solar panels, energy monitoring systems, inverters, and mounting systems. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, "Maxeon," "Oasis," "EnergyLink," "Equinox," "Helix," "InvisiMount," "Pantheon," "Serengeti," "Smarter Solar," "Smart Energy," "Solar Showdown," "SolarBridge," "Solaire," "Solaire Generation," "SunTile," "SunPower Electric," "SuPo Solar," "Tenesol," "TrueAC," "Greenbotics," "PowerLight," "More Energy. For Life.," "The Planet's Most Powerful Solar," "The Power of One," "The World's Standard for Solar," and "Use More Sun" in certain countries. We are seeking and will continue to seek registration of the "SunPower" trademark and other trademarks in additional countries as we believe is appropriate. As of January 1, 2017, we held registrations for 32 trademarks in the United States, and had 17 trademark registration applications pending. We also held 152 trademark registrations and had over 45 trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We typically require our business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells, technology, or business plans. We typically enter into proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, and joint venture partners.
We own multiple patents and patent applications that cover aspects of the technology in the solar cells, mounting products, and electrical and electronic systems that we currently manufacture and market. We continue to file for and receive new patent rights on a regular basis. The lifetime of a utility patent typically extends for 20 years from the date of filing with the relevant government authority. We assess appropriate opportunities for patent protection of those aspects of our technology, designs, methodologies, and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages to us, and for licensing opportunities of new technologies relevant to our business. As of January 1, 2017, we held 404 patents in the United States, which will expire at various times through 2035, and had 385 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 348 patents and had 778 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. We additionally rely on trade secret rights to protect our proprietary information and know-how. We employ proprietary processes and customized equipment in our manufacturing facilities. We therefore require employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect them.
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" including "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We depend on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights," "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer," 
 11

and "Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar products we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses."
Backlog
We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects. In the residential and commercial markets we often sell large volumes of solar panel, mounting systems, and other solar equipment to third parties, which are typically ordered by our third-party global dealer network and customers under standard purchase orders with relatively short delivery lead-times.  We often require project financing for development and construction of our solar power plant projects, which require significant investments before the equity is later sold to investors.  Our solar power system project backlog would therefore exclude sales contracts signed and completed in the same quarter and contracts still conditioned upon obtaining financing.  Based on these reasons, we believe backlog at any particular date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future revenue for any particular period of time.
Regulations
Public Policy Considerations
Different policy mechanisms have been used by governments to accelerate the adoption of solar power. Examples of customer-focused financial mechanisms include capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and net metering. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, or could be eliminated altogether. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net metering allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and to be credited for that excess electricity at or near the full retail price of electricity.
In addition to the mechanisms described above, new market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge. For example, many states in the United States have adopted renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewable energy resources.

The Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012
Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), requires us to disclose whether Total S.A. or any of its affiliates (collectively, the “Total Group”) engaged during the 2016 calendar year in certain Iran-related activities. While the Total Group has not engaged in any activity that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to 
 12

subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C) of Section 13(r)(1), affiliates of Total S.A. may be deemed to have engaged in certain transactions or dealings with the government of Iran that would require disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D), as discussed below. Unless otherwise noted, all foreign currency translations to U.S. dollars in this section are made using exchange rates as of January 1, 2017.
Upstream
Following the suspension of certain international economic sanctions against Iran on January 16, 2016, the Total Group commenced various business development activities in Iran. The Total Group entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the National Iranian Oil Company (“NIOC”), pursuant to which NIOC provided technical data on certain oil and gas projects so that the Total Group could assess potential developments in Iran in compliance with the remaining applicable international economic sanctions. The Total Group subsequently proposed to develop and operate the South Pars Phase 11 gas field offshore Iran in the Persian Gulf along the international border with Qatar. This resulted in the negotiation and signing, on November 8, 2016, of a heads of agreement (“HOA”) for the development and operation of the field. The parties to the HOA are NIOC, Total E&P South Pars S.A.S. (a wholly owned affiliate of Total S.A.), CNPC International Ltd. (a wholly owned affiliate of China National Petroleum Company) and Petropars Ltd. (a wholly owned affiliate of NIOC). The HOA contains the key principles and commercial terms that will be adopted in a definitive contract for the development and operation of South Pars Phase 11, should such definitive contract be finally agreed. The project is expected to have a production capacity of 370,000 boe/d and the produced gas will be fed into Iran’s gas network. The Total Group is expected to operate the project with a 50.1% interest alongside Petropars (19.9%) and CNPC (30%). The required investment is expected to be approximately $4 billion, of which The Total Group would finance 50.1%, with all equity contributions and payments in non-U.S. currency. In preparation for the South Pars Phase 11 project, The Total Group commenced engineering and reservoir studies, which were presented in part to Pars Oil & Gas Company (a NIOC affiliate) in 2016 during a technical workshop. In the event of new or reinstated international economic sanctions, if such sanctions were to prevent the Total Group from performing under the anticipated contract for South Pars Phase 11, The Total Group expects to be able to terminate the contract and recover its past costs from NIOC (unless prevented by sanctions).
Regarding other potential oil and gas projects covered by the aforementioned MOU, The Total Group held technical meetings in 2016 with representatives of NIOC and its affiliated companies and carried out a technical review of the South Azadegan oil field in Iran as well as the Iran LNG Project (a project contemplating a 10 Mt/y LNG production facility at Tombak Port on Iran’s Persian Gulf coast), the results of which were partially disclosed to NIOC and relevant affiliated companies. 
In addition, in connection with anticipated activities under the aforementioned MOU and HOA, The Total Group attended meetings in 2016 with the Iranian oil and gas ministry and several Iranian companies with ties to the government of Iran. 
Also in 2016, The Total Group was selected, along with other international oil and gas companies, to form an advisory group to the oil and gas ministries of Iran and Oman concerning a possible future gas pipeline between the two countries. In that regard, The Total Group entered into a confidentiality agreement and attended meetings with these companies and ministries.
In addition, The Total Group registered in 2016 a branch office of a new entity, Total Iran B.V., a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., the purpose of which is to serve as the representation office for the Total Group in Iran. This entity replaces Total E&P Iran, which previously served the same purpose, but only for Exploration & Production.
Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from any of the aforementioned activities in 2016, and the Total Group expects to conduct similar business development activities in 2017.
Some payments are yet to be reimbursed to the Total Group with respect to past expenditures and remuneration under buyback contracts entered into between 1997 and 1999 with NIOC for the development of the South Pars 2&3 and Dorood fields. With respect to these contracts, development operations were completed in 2010 and the Total Group is no longer involved in the operation of these fields.
Concerning payments to Iranian entities in 2016, Total E&P Iran (100%), Elf Petroleum Iran (99.8%), Total Sirri (100%) and Total South Pars (99.8%) collectively made payments of approximately IRR 3 billion (approximately $92,705) to (i) the Iranian administration for taxes and social security contributions concerning the personnel of the aforementioned local office and residual buyback contract-related obligations, and (ii) Iranian public entities for payments with respect to the maintenance 
 13

of the aforementioned local office (e.g., utilities, telecommunications). The Total Group expects similar types of payments to be made by these affiliates in 2017, albeit in higher amounts due to increased business development activity in Iran. Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from the aforementioned activities in 2016.
Furthermore, Total E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK”), a wholly-owned affiliate of The Total Group, holds a 43.25% interest in a joint venture at the Bruce field in the UK with BP Exploration Operating Company Limited (37.5%, operator), BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Ltd (16%) and Marubeni Oil & Gas (North Sea) Limited (3.75%). This joint venture is party to an agreement (the “Bruce Rhum Agreement”) governing certain transportation, processing and operation services provided to a joint venture at the Rhum field in the UK that is co-owned by BP (50%, operator) and the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd (“IOC”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%) (together, the “Rhum Owners”). TEP UK owned and operated the pipeline of the Frigg UK Association and the St Fergus Gas Terminal and was party to an agreement governing provision of transportation and processing services to the Rhum Owners (the “Rhum FUKA Agreement”) (the  Bruce Rhum Agreement and the Rhum FUKA Agreement being referred to collectively as the “Rhum Agreements”). On August 27, 2015, TEP UK signed a sale and purchase agreement to divest its entire interest in the Frigg UK Association pipeline and St Fergus Gas Terminal to NSMP Operations Limited (“NSMP”). On March 15, 2016, the divestment was completed and TEP UK’s interest in the Rhum FUKA Agreement was novated to NSMP. As from this date, TEP UK’s only interest in the Rhum FUKA Agreement is in relation to the settlement of historical force majeure claims with the Rhum Owners relating to the period when the Rhum field was shut down. To The Total Group's knowledge, provision of all services under the Rhum Agreements was initially suspended in November 2010, when the Rhum field stopped production following the adoption of EU sanctions, other than critical safety-related services (i.e., monitoring and marine inspection of the Rhum facilities), which were permitted by EU sanctions regulations. On October 22, 2013, the UK government notified IOC of its decision to apply a temporary management scheme to IOC’s interest in the Rhum field within the meaning of UK Regulations 3 and 5 of the Hydrocarbons (Temporary Management Scheme) Regulations 2013 (the "Hydrocarbons Regulations"). From October 22, 2013 until the termination of the temporary management scheme on March 16, 2016 (as further explained below), all correspondence by TEP UK in respect of IOC’s interest in the Rhum Agreements was with the UK government in its capacity as temporary manager of IOC’s interests. On December 6, 2013, the UK government authorized TEP UK, among others, under Article 43a of EU Regulation 267/2012, as amended by 1263/2012 and under Regulation 9 of the Hydrocarbons Regulations, to carry out activities in relation to the operation and production of the Rhum field. In addition, on September 4, 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a license to BP authorizing BP and certain others to engage in various activities relating to the operation and production of the Rhum field. Following receipt of all necessary authorizations, the Rhum field resumed production on October 26, 2014 with IOC’s interest in the Rhum field and the Rhum Agreements subject to the UK government’s temporary management pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Regulations. Services were provided by TEP UK under the Rhum Agreements from October 26, 2014 and TEP UK received tariff income and revenues from BP and the UK government (in its capacity as temporary manager of IOC’s interest in the Rhum field) in accordance with the terms of the Rhum Agreements until the termination of the temporary management scheme in March 2016. As IOC ceased to be a listed person within the meaning of the Hydrocarbons Regulations on January 16, 2016, the UK government gave notice to IOC on January 22, 2016 of the termination of the temporary management scheme with effect from March 16, 2016 in accordance with regulation 26(1)(a) and 27(1)(a) of the Hydrocarbons Regulations. As a result, since March 16, 2016, TEP UK has liaised directly with IOC concerning its interest in the Bruce Rhum Agreement, and services have been provided by TEP UK under the Bruce Rhum Agreement to IOC as Rhum Owner. In 2016, these activities generated for TEP UK gross revenue of approximately £8 million (approximately $9.9 million) and net profit of approximately £0.20 million (approximately $0.2 million). Subject to the foregoing, TEP UK intends to continue such activities so long as they continue to be permissible under UK and EU law and not be in breach of remaining applicable international economic sanctions.
Downstream
The Total Group does not own or operate any refineries or chemicals plants in Iran and did not purchase Iranian hydrocarbons when prohibited by applicable EU and U.S. economic and financial sanctions (refer to point 1.9.1, above).
The Total Group resumed its trading activities with Iran in February 2016 via its wholly-owned affiliates Totsa Total Oil Trading S.A. and Total Trading Asia Pte Ltd. During 2016, approximately 50 Mb of crude oil from Iran were purchased for nearly €1.8 billion (approximately $1.9 billion) pursuant to a mix of spot and term contracts. Most of this crude oil was used to supply the Total Group's refineries and, therefore, it is not possible to estimate the related gross revenue and net profit. However, approximately 1.4 Mb of this crude oil were sold to entities outside of the Total Group. In addition, in 2016 approximately 11 Mb of petroleum products were bought from/sold to entities with ties to the government of Iran. These operations generated gross revenue of nearly €374 million (approximately $393.5 million) and net profit of approximately €2.7 million (approximately $2.8 million). The affiliates expect to continue these activities in 2017.
 14

Saft Groupe S.A. (“Saft”), a wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, in 2016 sold signaling and backup battery systems for metros and railways as well as products for the utilities and oil and gas sectors to companies in Iran, including some having direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. In 2016, this activity generated gross revenue of approximately €5.6 million (approximately $5.9 million) and net profit of approximately €800,000 (approximately $841,636). Saft expects to continue this activity in 2017.
Saft also attended the Iran Oil Show in 2016, where it discussed business opportunities with Iranian customers, including those with direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. Saft expects to conduct similar business development activities in 2017.
Total Solar (formerly named Total Energie Developpement), a wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, had preliminary discussions in 2016 regarding the potential development of solar projects with companies in Iran, including some having direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. Neither revenues nor profits were recognized from this activity in 2016, and Total Solar expects to continue this activity in 2017.
Total S.A. signed in 2016 a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the National Petrochemical Company, a company owned by the government of Iran, to consider a project for the construction in Iran of a steamcracker and polyethylene production lines. In relation to the early stages of this project, several visits to Iran were conducted in 2016 and one employee has been seconded to Total Iran B.V. Total S.A. recognized no revenue or profit from this activity in 2016 and similar activities are expected to continue in 2017.
Representatives of the companies Le Joint Français (a subsidiary of Hutchinson SA) and Hutchinson SNC, wholly-owned affiliates of the Total Group, conducted multiple visits to Iran in 2016 to discuss business opportunities in the car industry sector with several companies, including some having direct or indirect ties with the Iranian government. These companies recognized no revenue or profit from this activity in 2016 and expect to continue such discussions in the future.
Hutchinson Gmbh, a wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, sold plastic tubing for automobiles in 2016 to Iran Khodro, a company in which the government of Iran holds a 20% interest and which is supervised by Iran’s Industrial Management Organization. In 2016, these activities generated gross revenue of approximately €900,000 (approximately $946,840) and net profit of approximately €150,000 (approximately $157,807). This company expects to continue this activity in 2017.
Hanwha Total Petrochemicals (“HTC”), a joint venture in which Total Holdings UK Limited (a wholly-owned affiliate of The Total Group) holds a 50% interest and Hanwha General Chemicals holds a 50% interest, purchased nearly 25 Mb of condensates from NIOC for approximately KRW 1,300 billion (approximately $1.1 million). These condensates are used as raw material for certain of the Total Group's steamcrackers. HTC expects to continue this activity in 2017.
Total Research & Technology Feluy (“TRTF”), a wholly-owned affiliate of The Total Group, commenced in 2016 the process to file a patent in Iran for pipes comprising a multimodal metallocene-catalyzed polyethylene resin. Related to this process, TRTF had contacts with Iranian government officials, but no fees were paid. TRTF expects to continue the patent filing process in 2017.
Until December 2012, at which time it sold its entire interest, the Total Group held a 50% interest in the lubricants retail company Beh Total (now named Beh Tam) along with Behran Oil (50%), a company controlled by entities with ties to the government of Iran. As part of the sale of the Total Group's interest in Beh Tam, Total S.A. agreed to license the trademark “Total” to Beh Tam for an initial 3-year period for the sale by Beh Tam of lubricants to domestic consumers in Iran. In 2014, Total E&P Iran (“TEPI”), a wholly-owned affiliate of Total S.A., received, on behalf of Total S.A., royalty payments of approximately IRR 24 billion (nearly $1 million) from Beh Tam for such license. These payments were based on Beh Tam’s sales of lubricants during the previous calendar year. In 2015, royalty payments were suspended due to a procedure brought by the Iranian tax authorities against TEPI. At the end of 2016, this procedure was still pending and no royalty payments had been received since 2015. Representatives of Total Outre Mer, a wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, made several visits to Beh Tam and Behran Oil during 2016 regarding the possible purchase of shares of Beh Tam. Subsequent to an internal reorganization, the matter was transferred to Total Oil Asia-Pacific Ltd, another wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, which had several exchanges with representatives of Behran Oil. As of the end of 2016, no agreement had been reached, no money was paid or received by either company. Similar discussions may take place in the future.
 15

Total Marketing Middle East FZE (“TMME”), a wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, sold lubricants to Beh Tam in 2016. The sale in 2016 of approximately 54 tons of lubricants and special fluids generated gross revenue of approximately AED 420,000 (approximately $30,711) and net profit of approximately AED 360,000 (approximately $26,324). TMME expects to continue this activity in 2017.
Total Marketing France (“TMF”), a company wholly-owned by Total Marketing Services (“TMS”), itself a company wholly-owned by Total S.A. and six Total Group employees, provided in 2016 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy in France for use in the Total Group's service stations. In 2016, these activities generated gross revenue of nearly €22,000 (approximately $23,145) and net profit of nearly €900 (approximately $947). TMF expects to continue this activity in 2017.
TMF also sold jet fuel in 2016 to Iran Air as part of its airplane refueling activities at Paris Orly airport in France. The sale of approximately 2.8 million liters of jet fuel generated gross revenue of approximately €982,000 (approximately $1.0 million) and net profit of approximately €10,000 (approximately $10,520). TMF expects to continue this activity through at least February 2017, when the contract arrives at its term. 
Air Total International (“ATI”), a wholly-owned affiliate of the Total Group, on two occasions in 2016 sold jet fuel to a broker based at Le Bourget airport near Paris that was destined for the refueling of an Iranian government airplane (official presidential/ministerial visits). These sales generated gross revenue of approximately €8,000 (approximately $8,416) and net profit of approximately €1,600 (approximately $1,683). ATI may conduct similar activities in 2017.
Total Belgium (“TB”), a company wholly-owned by the Total Group, provided in 2016 fuel payment cards to the Iranian embassy in Brussels (Belgium) for use in the Total Group's service stations. In 2016, these activities generated gross revenue of approximately €1,500 (approximately $1,578) and net profit of approximately €300 (approximately $316). TB expects to continue this activity in 2017.
Proxifuel, a company wholly-owned by the Total Group, sold in 2016 heating oil to the Iranian embassy in Brussels.

Seasonal Trends
 16

Our business is subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations including changes in weather patterns and economic incentives, among others. Sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends with the largest percentage of total revenues realized during the last two quarters of our fiscal year. The construction of solar power systems or installation of solar power components and related revenue may decline during cold winter months. In the United States, many customers make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. In addition, revenues may fluctuate due to the timing of project sales, construction schedules, and revenue recognition of certain projects, such as those involving real estate, which may significantly impact the quarterly profile of the Company's results of operations. We may also retain certain development projects on our balance sheet for longer periods of time than in preceding periods in order to optimize the economic value we receive at the time of sale in light of market conditions, which can fluctuate after we have committed to projects. Delays in disposing of projects, or changes in amounts realized on disposition, may lead to significant fluctuations to the period-over-period profile of our results of operations and our cash available for working capital needs.
