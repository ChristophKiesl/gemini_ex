Mediasite Video Capture Solutions
 Mediasite provides the following primary flexible hardware and software solutions to record and upload any video-based content from anywhere, automatically:
 

• | Mediasite Recorder and Recorder Pro: The Recorder and Recorder Pro are built-in room appliances that use schedule-based capture and advanced audio/video integration to fully automate high-quality video and content recording in lecture halls, training rooms, simulation labs and auditoriums. The room can be scheduled to automatically record and publish to Mediasite, so instructors and speakers can focus on teaching and presenting, free from technology worries and confident that everything said and presented is being captured.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mediasite Mobile Recorders: The Mobile Recorder is a portable recording device used to capture and stream broadcast-quality video from any environment when portability is key. Designed for on-the-go webcasting, hybrid events, guest speakers and conferences, the lightweight design moves easily from location to location and can be set up and ready to record in only a few minutes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mediasite Mosaic: Formerly known as My Mediasite, Mosaic allows instructors, employees and students to create high quality videos, screencasts and slideshows from their computers or mobile devices with just one click.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As a result of COVID, many of our customers switched to remote work and teaching, and the need for traditional in-room video capture slowed. While this caused a temporary dislocation for Sonic Foundry’s customary offerings, the Company’s medium, and long-term opportunity for providing enhanced digital capabilities multiplied. The way we live, work and play has been permanently disrupted, ushering a new era of being connected on-demand. Sonic Foundry offers its customers an end-to-end solution that can be rapidly and efficiently deployed with its Mediasite Video Management and Delivery Solutions.
 
Mediasite Video Management and Delivery Solutions
 Mediasite is a scalable, reliable, and secure solution to manage, search, analyze, publish, and stream video content. With Mediasite, government, businesses, and education institutions can:
 

• | Automatically publish video to a learning management system (LMS), content management system (CMS), training portal or any website
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Centrally manage and secure any video 
• | Create an enterprise or campus YouTube channel 
• | Deepen engagement and improve learning with quizzing, annotations, comments, polls, surveys and other interactive tools 
• | Analyze viewing metrics to measure learner engagement and outcomes 
• | Search everything with fully indexed audio, video and slide content 
• | Stream live and on-demand video to any device 

 
Mediasite On-Premises or Mediasite Cloud
 Mediasite is available as either an on-premises license or as a SaaS (Software as a Service) offering within our Mediasite Cloud. Customers can conveniently host and manage all their content with Mediasite Cloud, or use it as needed for large events to divert heavy viewing traffic from their on-premises Mediasite deployment. Our co-located and high availability data centers and experienced team successfully manage customers’ cloud-based video streaming in a secure, fault-tolerant environment. During 2020, the Company made an investment in a new dual redundant, high availability data center in the United Kingdom, which went online at the end of September 2020. The Company also upgraded its existing US data centers, which went online during the first calendar quarter of 2021.
 
COVID Accelerated the Use of Video as a Key Communications Tool by Possibly Ten Years
 
Even before COVID, companies were increasingly focused on becoming digital-forward enterprises. Anticipating this new market paradigm, Sonic Foundry invested in its data center infrastructure to help customers achieve their IT support objectives prior to COVID. Consequently, the Company was prepared to immediately support customer needs for handling the dramatic and rapid increase in data storage by migrating them to Mediasite Cloud.  This accelerated customer adoption of Sonic Foundry’s cloud strategy and generated additional cloud revenue.
 
Any further hardware investment required would be offset by an increase in revenue from hosting. The Company believes the significant increase in video content creation will proliferate as video conferencing systems like Zoom and Teams are used to record meetings and presentations. Between 2019-2021, Sonic Foundry developed and released an advanced integration to seamlessly automate workflow between Zoom or Teams, Mediasite, and a school's LMS. This allows all video content to be edited and managed in one secure location regardless of how it was recorded. Given the ongoing supply chain disruption, the Company believes any delays and uncertainty in hardware orders will be offset by increasing software licenses and cloud contracts.

Our Service Offerings Address the New Virtual World 
 
Mediasite Events
 Mediasite Events provides live and on-demand webcasting services for conferences, hybrid events and high-profile broadcasts, supplying turnkey streaming solutions for hundreds of events each year. Fortune 500 companies, universities, associations, sporting events and charitable organizations use Mediasite Events to capture, produce, and deliver high-quality event experiences, both in-person and virtually.
 
Our Mediasite Events business, both in the United States (US) and Japan, was significantly impacted by COVID. In early March 2020, all near-term, in-person events started to cancel due to concerns over the virus. While the Company’s in-person pipeline for the remainder of March and April shrunk to zero, it quickly replaced in-person events with virtual events. Since late March 2020, the US team has been helping customers continue to hold high-quality events via our virtual events platform, which utilizes Mediasite technology. In-person events did not resume at a typical level in fiscal 2021 based on continued concern over virus variants. As in-person events resume, the Company is optimistic that virtual events will remain an ongoing solution for the event industry.
 
Mediasite Professional Services
 Customers maximize their return on video with additional Mediasite Services including integration services, installation assistance, custom development, training, and monitoring services  .  While COVID impacted the Company’s ability to do onsite services, it has been able to provide the majority of our professional services remotely, allowing the opportunity to provide uninterrupted year-round professional services support to new users and existing customers.
Mediasite Customer Care
 Mediasite Customer Care plans include software upgrades for Mediasite and Mediasite capture solutions, technical support, warranty extensions and advanced replacement on hardware, as well as access to the Mediasite Community and other online resources. Nearly all our customers purchase a Customer Care plan when they purchase Mediasite or Mediasite capture solutions. Annual service contracts for Mediasite Video Cloud include a Standard Customer Care plan. COVID has not had an immediate impact on our Customer Care plans. It is, however, difficult to predict the long-term impact should the pandemic persist.

Segment Information
 
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280-10, Segment Reporting, the Company has three operating segments; however, these segments meet the criteria for aggregation for reporting purposes as one reporting segment as of September 30, 2021.
 
Billings
 
Our services are typically billed and collected in advance of providing the service. Billings, which are a non-GAAP measure, are an important indicator of customer activity and cash flow in addition to revenue, and is therefore used by management as a key operational indicator. Billings are computed by combining revenue with the change in unearned revenue.
 
Our largest individual customers can be either value added resellers (“VARs”) or end users in the case of large higher education institutions. No single customer represented over 10% of billings or revenue in 2021 or 2020.
 
Sales
 
We sell and market our offerings through a sales force that manages a channel of value-added resellers, system integrators, and consultants. These third-party representatives specialize in understanding both audio/video systems and IT networking. We also sold to approximately 300 resellers, and over 1,150 total end users.
 
Market expansion:
 
Historically, over two-thirds of our revenue has been realized from the education market. However, COVID escalated the rapid adoption of video as a remote work and learning solution across all industry sectors. This development represents an exciting trend that can extend Sonic Foundry’s market opportunity beyond the traditional academic customer base into new verticals.
 
For our higher education as well as corporate, government and association clients, we anticipate economic conditions will expand market demand for more outsourced services versus licensed, on-premises sales. Over the last two years, the Company has made extensive capital and technology investments to advance its services model with turnkey event webcasting, a comprehensive cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) datacenter, and e-commerce capabilities that position us to diversify our customer base as well as generate more recurring revenues.
 
For our Mediasite Events business both in the US and Japan, we continue to see growing demand for virtual events that we believe will extend beyond COVID. These event-based communication, education and training platforms are expected to help drive the Company’s corporate sales activities going forward.
 
While the competitive landscape has grown in the past two years, we believe our services offerings, particularly as it relates to high-touch white glove event services, give us a distinct advantage over the many virtual event platforms that have launched opportunistically since COVID. As enterprises and education institutions return to a new normal mixed audiences of in person and virtual, we are confident our experience and reputation automating and recording from mixed spaces will position us well over offerings that cater to in person only or virtual only.

Operations
 
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead we contract with a third party to build the hardware for our Mediasite Recorders and purchase quantities sufficient to fill specific customer orders, including purchases of inventory by resellers. Quantities are maintained in inventory by the third-party provider and shipped directly to the end customer or reseller. The hardware manufacturer provides a limited one-year warranty on the hardware, which is passed on to our customers who purchase a Mediasite Customer Care support and maintenance plan. While we have long standing relationships with our contract manufacturers, there are other manufacturing alternatives if needed.
Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success will depend on our ability to deepen our relationship with current customers and attract new customers by offering a compelling value proposition that enhances their workplace and business objectives. Accordingly, we invest a significant amount of our resources in research and development activities, with a particular focus on our SaaS offerings. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we spent $7.2 million and $6.3 million, respectively, on internal research and development activities in our business. These amounts represent 20% in 2021 and 18% in 2020 of total revenue.
Global Expansion
 
In fiscal 2014, we acquired MediaMission B.V.in the Netherlands and Mediasite KK in Japan.  With these acquisitions, we significantly expanded our global market reach in Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region and accelerated our commitment to enterprise video communication worldwide.  The investment in maintaining a local presence in these regions has allowed us to better serve the ongoing sales and support demands of our customers and prospective customers in those markets. Additionally, we’ve been able to deploy customer care and cloud hosting services more quickly in each of those markets to capitalize on the trend to move data intensive applications, such as video, to the cloud.
Human Capital
 
At September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had 180 and 177 full-time employees, respectively. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, nor are they subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
We have a competitive compensation plan and benefits plan that is designed to attract, retain, and reward individuals and includes an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k plan with a matching contribution.  Through our volunteer program, employees are granted 3 days of PTO per calendar year to volunteer and support the local and global community.
