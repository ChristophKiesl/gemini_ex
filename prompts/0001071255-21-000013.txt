ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1998 under the name of GCI Lakes, Inc., which name was subsequently changed to Lakes Gaming, Inc. in August 1998, to Lakes Entertainment, Inc. in June 2002 and to Golden Entertainment, Inc. in July 2015. Our shares began trading publicly in January 1999. The mailing address of our headquarters is 6595 S Jones Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118, and our telephone number at that location is (702) 893-7777.
Overview
We own and operate a diversified entertainment platform, consisting of a portfolio of gaming assets that focus on resort casino operations and distributed gaming (including gaming in our branded taverns).
We conduct our business through two reportable operating segments: Casinos and Distributed Gaming. In our Casinos segment, we own and operate ten resort casino properties in Nevada and Maryland. Our Distributed Gaming segment involves the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores in Nevada and Montana, and the operation of branded taverns targeting local patrons located primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area.
Acquisitions
On January 14, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Edgewater Gaming, LLC and Colorado Belle Gaming, LLC (the “Laughlin Entities”) from Marnell Gaming, LLC (“Marnell”) for $156.2 million in cash (after giving effect to the post-closing adjustment provisions in the purchase agreement) and the issuance by us of 911,002 shares of our common stock to certain assignees of Marnell (the “Laughlin Acquisition”). The Laughlin Acquisition added two resort casino properties in Laughlin, Nevada to our casino portfolio: the Edgewater Hotel & Casino Resort (“Edgewater”) and the Colorado Belle Hotel & Casino Resort (“Colorado Belle”), which increase our scale and presence in the Southern Nevada market. The results of operations of the Laughlin Entities are included in our results subsequent to the acquisition date. 
Refer to “Note 3 — Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Annual Report for additional information regarding this acquisition.
Impact of COVID-19
Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, people across the globe have been advised to avoid non-essential travel, and steps have been taken by governmental authorities, including in the states in which we operate, to implement closures of non-essential operations to contain the spread of the virus. The pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Following emergency executive orders issued by the Governors of Nevada, Maryland, and Montana, in the week of March 16, 2020, all of our properties were temporarily closed to the public and our Distributed Gaming operations at third-party locations were suspended. Our Distributed Gaming operations in Montana and Nevada resumed on May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020, respectively, and our Casino operations in Nevada and Maryland resumed on June 4, 2020 and June 19, 2020, respectively. However, as a result of the impact of the pandemic, the operations of the Colorado Belle remain suspended. While all of our properties, except for the Colorado Belle, re-opened during the second quarter of 2020, our implementation of protocols intended to protect team members, gaming patrons and guests from potential COVID-19 exposure continues to limit our operations. These measures include enhanced sanitization, public gathering limitations of 25-50% of casino, tavern and venue capacity, patron social distancing requirements, restrictions on permitted hours of operations, limitations on casino operations, which include disabling electronic gaming machines, and face mask and temperature check requirements for patrons. Certain amenities at our casinos may remain closed or operate in a limited capacity, including restaurants, bars, and other food and beverage outlets, as well as table games, showrooms, meeting rooms, spas and pools. These measures limit the number of patrons that are able to attend these venues. We cannot predict when these restrictions on our operations will be changed or eliminated.
On July 10, 2020, the Governor of Nevada issued an emergency executive order mandating the closure of bar tops and bar areas in restaurants, bars, pubs, taverns, breweries, distilleries, wineries and related facilities that are licensed to serve food in seven counties, including Clark County (the location of most of our branded taverns). In response to the Governor’s executive order, we immediately closed most of our tavern locations. We implemented modifications of the gaming areas in our taverns which allowed us to re-open our tavern locations beginning in late July 2020 and all of our tavern locations had re-opened by the end of September 2020. 
On November 24, 2020, the Governor of Nevada issued an emergency executive order limiting occupancy in gaming areas and non-gaming businesses including but not limited to retail stores, restaurants and bars, non-retail venues, pools and aquatic facilities, and other establishments in Nevada to not exceed 25% of the listed fire code capacity. On February 15, 2021 certain COVID-19 mitigation measures were eased by allowing the occupancy rate at gaming floors and food and beverage establishments, including restaurants, bars, pubs, wineries, distilleries and breweries, to increase to 35%. Occupancy at retail stores, pools and aquatic facilities increased to 50% of the listed fire code capacity. The February 15, 2021 order remained in effect as of the filing of this Annual Report and it is uncertain when COVID-19 mitigation measures will be further eased. 
With respect to our operations in Montana, on November 20, 2020, the Governor of Montana issued an emergency executive order limiting operating capacity at all restaurants and bars to 50%. In addition, the order required all such businesses to close between the hours of 10 pm and 4 am. This order remained in effect as of December 31, 2020 and it is uncertain when it will be lifted. 
Our Maryland operations have been subject to a reduced operating capacity requirement of 50% since re-opening on June 19, 2020. On November 17, 2020, the Governor of Maryland issued an emergency executive order further restricting food service establishments by requiring them to close from 10 pm to 6 am. During these closure hours, such establishments are allowed to take carry out and delivery orders off premises but such venues, including casinos, are not permitted to serve any beverages. This order remained in effect as of December 31, 2020 and it is uncertain when it will be lifted. 
The disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The duration and intensity of this global health emergency and related disruptions is uncertain, as it is unknown when the pandemic will end, when or how quickly the current travel restrictions, occupancy and other limitations will be modified or cease to be necessary, and how these uncertainties will impact our business and the willingness of customers to spend on travel and entertainment.
Temporary closures of our operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lease concessions for certain of the our taverns and route locations. Such concessions provided for deferral and, in some instances, forgiveness of rent payments with no substantive amendments to the consideration due per the terms of the original contract and did not result in a substantial changes in our obligations under such leases. Refer to “Note 1 — Nature of Business” for additional information.
The impact of COVID-19 on our operations qualified as a triggering event necessitating an evaluation of long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment as discussed in “Note 4 — Property and Equipment” and “Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Annual Report.
Our $200 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) was undrawn and available for borrowing as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we have implemented various mitigating actions to preserve liquidity, including delaying material capital expenditures, reducing operating expenses and implementing a cost reduction program with respect to discretionary expenditures. To further enhance our liquidity position or to finance any future acquisition or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public or private credit and capital markets.
Casinos
We own and operate ten resort casino properties in Nevada and Maryland. In light of COVID-19, certain amenities at our resort casino properties may remain closed or operate in a limited capacity, including restaurants, bars, and other food and beverage outlets, as well as table games, spas and pools.

The Strat: The Strat is our premier resort casino property, located on Las Vegas Boulevard on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip. The Strat comprises the iconic SkyPod, a casino, a hotel and a retail center. As of December 31, 2020, in addition to hotel rooms and gaming in an 80,000 square foot casino, The Strat offered nine restaurants, two rooftop pools, a fitness center, retail shops and entertainment facilities.*
Arizona Charlie’s casinos: Our Arizona Charlie’s Boulder and Arizona Charlie’s Decatur casino properties primarily serve local Las Vegas gaming patrons, and provide an alternative experience to the Las Vegas Strip. Arizona Charlie’s Boulder is located on Boulder Highway, in an established retail and residential neighborhood in the eastern metropolitan area of Las Vegas. The property is easily accessible from I-515, the primary east/west highway in Las Vegas. Arizona Charlie’s Decatur is located four miles west of the Las Vegas Strip in the heavily populated west Las Vegas area, and is easily accessible from US Route 95, a major highway in Las Vegas. As of December 31, 2020, in addition to hotel rooms, gaming and bingo facilities, Arizona Charlie’s Decatur offered five restaurants and Arizona Charlie’s Boulder offered four restaurants and an RV park with approximately 220 RV hook-up sites.*
Laughlin casinos: We own and operate three resort casinos in Laughlin, Nevada, which is located approximately 90 miles from Las Vegas on the western riverbank of the Colorado River. Our Laughlin casinos are situated on 56 adjacent acres along the heart of the Laughlin Riverwalk and cater primarily to patrons traveling from Arizona and Southern California, as well as customers from Nevada seeking an alternative to the Las Vegas experience. As of December 31, 2020, in addition to hotel rooms and gaming, the Aquarius had nine restaurants, the Colorado Belle featured three restaurants, and the Edgewater offered six restaurants and dedicated entertainment venues, including the Laughlin Event Center. The Laughlin Event Center, which is situated within walking distance from the Edgewater and in close proximity to our other Laughlin properties, is an outdoor arena that can seat up to approximately 12,000 guests and hosts various entertainment programs throughout the year, such as concerts, festivals, bull riding, rodeo, off-road racing and extreme sports events. As noted above, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of the Colorado Belle remain suspended.*
Pahrump casinos: We own and operate three casinos in Pahrump, Nevada, which is located approximately 60 miles from Las Vegas and is a gateway to Death Valley National Park. As of December 31, 2020, in addition to hotel rooms, gaming and bingo facilities at our Pahrump casino properties, Pahrump Nugget offered a bowling center and a 4,700 square foot banquet and event center and our Lakeside Casino & RV Park offered approximately 160 RV hook-up sites.*
Rocky Gap: Rocky Gap is situated on approximately 270 acres in the Rocky Gap State Park in Maryland, which we lease from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (the “Maryland DNR”) under a 40-year ground lease expiring in 2052 (plus a 20-year option renewal). As of December 31, 2020, in addition to hotel rooms and gaming, Rocky Gap offered three restaurants, a spa and the only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course in Maryland. Rocky Gap is a AAA Four Diamond Award® winning resort and includes an event and conference center.*
* As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health orders, we have reduced capacity or temporarily closed certain of our amenities at our resort casino properties.
Distributed Gaming
Our Distributed Gaming segment involves the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores in Nevada and Montana. We place our slots and amusement devices in locations where we believe they will receive maximum customer traffic, generally near a store’s entrance. In addition, we own and operate branded taverns with slots, which target local patrons, primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2020, our distributed gaming operations comprised over 10,800 slots in over 1,000 locations. In August 2017, we became licensed as a video gaming terminal operator in Illinois and in October 2018, we received a conditional license to operate in Pennsylvania, providing for potential expansion into new jurisdictions.
Nevada law limits distributed gaming operations (also known as “restricted gaming” operations) to certain types of non-casino locations, including grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, restaurants, bars, taverns and liquor stores, where gaming is incidental to the primary business being conducted at the location and games are generally limited to 15 or fewer slots and no other forms of gaming activity. The gaming area in these business locations is typically small, and in many instances, segregated from the primary business area, including the use of alcoves in grocery stores and drug stores and installation of slots into the physical bar (also known as “bar top” slots) in bars and taverns. Such segregation provides greater oversight and supervision of the slots. Under Montana law, distributed gaming operations are limited to business locations licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption only, with such locations generally restricted to offering a maximum of 20 slots.
In Nevada, we generally enter into three types of slot placement contracts as part of our distributed gaming business: space lease agreements, participation agreements and space lease agreements with revenue share provisions. Under space lease agreements that do not have revenue share provisions, we generally pay a fixed monthly rental fee for the right to install, maintain and operate our slots at a business location and we hold the applicable gaming license allowing us to operate such slots. Under participation agreements, the business location holds the applicable gaming license and retains a percentage of the gaming revenue generated from our slots. Space lease agreements with revenue share provisions are a hybrid model that has both space lease and participation elements and we pay the business a percentage of the gaming revenue generated from our slots placed at the location, rather than a fixed monthly rental fee. Under such arrangements, we hold the applicable gaming license to conduct gaming at the location and the business location is required to obtain separate regulatory approval to receive a percentage of the gaming revenue. In Montana, our slot and amusement device placement contracts are all participation agreements.
Our branded taverns offer a casual, upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, craft beer and other alcoholic beverages, and typically include 15 onsite slots. As of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 66 branded taverns, which offered a total of over 1,000 onsite slots. We continue to look for opportunistic and accretive opportunities to pursue additional tavern openings and acquisitions. Most of our taverns are located in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area and cater to local patrons seeking more convenient entertainment establishments than traditional casino properties. Our tavern patrons are typically younger than traditional casino customers, which diversifies our customer demographic. Our tavern brands include Sierra Junction, PT’s Pub, PT’s Place, PT’s Gold, PT’s Ranch, Sean Patrick’s, Sierra Gold and SG Bar. 
Sales and Marketing
Casinos
We market our Nevada resort casino properties to both the locals market and tourist traffic, targeting the value-driven customer. We seek to attract local residents to our Nevada casinos through promotions geared towards enhancing local play, including dining offerings at our casino restaurants and promotions of our bowling and bingo amenities. Promotional programs for out-of-market patrons focus primarily on The Strat casino property (with almost 600 newly renovated rooms, new and refreshed food and beverage outlets, and the iconic SkyPod), and our award-winning RV park surrounding a lake at the Lakeside Casino & RV Park.
Rocky Gap is located in western Maryland in close proximity to the affluent and heavily populated metropolitan areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C., as well as two major interstate freeways. Rocky Gap serves as a premier destination for both local and out-of-market patrons. Our marketing efforts for Rocky Gap are primarily focused on attracting patrons through local and regional campaigns promoting both the amenities of Rocky Gap and the vast array of outdoor activities available in the Rocky Gap State Park.
Our casino sales and marketing efforts also include our new consolidated loyalty program, True Rewards®, designed to encourage repeat business at our resort casino properties, as discussed below.
Distributed Gaming
We conduct our operations in our Distributed Gaming segment in Nevada and Montana. Our Distributed Gaming customer base is comprised of the third party distributed gaming customers with whom we enter into slot and amusement device placement contracts for the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices at non-casino locations, the primarily local patrons that use our slots and amusement devices in such locations and the primarily local patrons of our branded taverns. We seek to place our slots and amusement devices in strategic, high-traffic areas, including in our branded taverns, and the majority of our marketing efforts are focused on maximizing profitability from a high-frequency, convenience-driven customer base.
Our Distributed Gaming sales and marketing efforts also include our True Rewards loyalty program, which is designed to encourage repeat business at our branded taverns and at slots located at participating supermarkets, as discussed below.
True Rewards Loyalty Program
Our marketing efforts also seek to capitalize on repeat visitation through the use of our True Rewards loyalty program. We offer our True Rewards loyalty program at all ten of our resort casino properties, as well as at all of our branded taverns and at participating supermarkets. Members of our True Rewards loyalty program may earn points based on gaming activity and amounts spent on rooms, food, beverage and resort activities at our resort casino properties, and on play and amounts spent on the purchase of food and beverages at our branded taverns and other participating Distributed Gaming locations. Loyalty points are redeemable for complimentary slot play, food, beverages, grocery gift cards and hotel rooms, among other items. All points earned in the loyalty program roll up into a single account balance which is redeemable enterprise-wide at participating locations.
Our rewards technology is designed to track customer behavior indicators such as visitation, customer spend and customer engagement. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 620,000 active players in our marketing database, providing us with an avenue to drive customer engagement and cross-marketing opportunities across our resort casino and distributed gaming platform.
Intellectual Property
We pursue registration of our important trademarks and service marks in the states where we do business and with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered and/or have pending as trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, among other trademarks and service marks, “Golden Entertainment” and “Golden Gaming,” as well as various names, brands and logos relating to our resort casino properties, customer loyalty programs and branded taverns. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in various jurisdictions in the United States in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects. We also hold a patent in the United States related to player tracking systems.
Competition
The resort casino and distributed gaming industries are highly competitive. Our resort casino business competes with numerous casinos and casino-hotels of varying quality and size in our markets. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.
Furthermore, several states are currently considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas, and Native American tribes may develop or expand gaming properties in markets located more closely to our customer base (particularly Native American casinos located in California). The expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers, including legalized casino gaming in neighboring states and on Native American land, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
With respect to our distributed gaming businesses, we face direct competition from others involved in the distributed gaming business, as well as substantial competition for customers from other operators of casinos, hotels, taverns and other entertainment venues. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.
In addition, in both of our segments we face ever-increasing competition from online gaming, including mobile gaming applications for smart phones and tablet computers, state-sponsored lotteries, card clubs, sports books, fantasy sports websites and other forms of legalized gaming. Various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition for our operations.
Regulation
Gaming Regulation
We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. State and local government authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate require us to obtain gaming licenses and require our officers, key employees and business entity affiliates to demonstrate suitability to be involved in gaming operations. These are privileged licenses or approvals which are not guaranteed by statute or regulation. State and local government authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license, 
impose substantial fines, and take other actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain and maintain the gaming licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us and our business. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Our business is subject to extensive gaming regulation, which is costly to comply with, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Gaming authorities may, in their sole and absolute discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective states. Further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any gaming authority under these circumstances is typically required to be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. Our articles of incorporation require our shareholders to cooperate with gaming authorities in such investigations and permit us to redeem the securities held by any shareholder whose holding of shares of our capital stock may result, in the judgment of our Board of Directors, in our failure to obtain or our loss of any license or franchise from any governmental agency held by us to conduct any portion of our business. If any gaming authority determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of our privileged licenses or approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Our shareholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation and, if a shareholder is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, that shareholder would not be able to beneficially own our common stock directly or indirectly. Our shareholders may also be required to provide information that is requested by gaming authorities and we have the right, under certain circumstances, to redeem a shareholder’s securities; we may be forced to use our cash or incur debt to fund redemption of our securities” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Our directors, officers and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various privileged licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find any of our directors, officers or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever our relationship with that person. Furthermore, such gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.
Applicable gaming laws and regulations also restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt, and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require approval of gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.
The gaming industry also represents a significant source of tax revenue, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and municipalities. From time to time, various federal, state and local legislators and other government officials have proposed and adopted changes in tax laws, or in the administration or interpretation of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of possible changes in tax laws or in the administration or interpretation of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. For additional information, refer to the risk factor entitled “Changes to gaming tax laws could increase our cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition” in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such change to the regulatory environment or the adoption of new federal, state or local government legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Other Regulation
Our business is subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to emissions and discharges into the environment, and the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. These laws and regulations are complex, and subject to change, and violations can lead to significant costs for corrective action and remediation, fines and penalties. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time that they occurred, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. As we acquire additional casino, resort and tavern properties, such as the casino properties we acquired in the Laughlin Acquisition, we may not know the full level of exposure that we may have undertaken despite appropriate due diligence. We endeavor to maintain compliance with environmental laws, but from time to time, current or historical operations on or adjacent to, our properties may have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. In that regard, we may incur costs for cleaning up contamination relating to historical uses of certain properties.
Many of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. In 2017, several former employees filed two separate purported class action lawsuits against us and on behalf of similarly situated individuals employed by us in Nevada, which lawsuits were settled in 2019. The lawsuits alleged that we violated certain Nevada labor laws, including payment of an hourly wage below the statutory minimum wage without providing a qualified health insurance plan and an associated failure to pay proper overtime compensation. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our branded taverns and casino properties to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authority for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages. In addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.
Seasonality
We believe that our Casinos and Distributed Gaming segments are affected by seasonal factors, including holidays, weather and travel conditions. Our casinos and distributed gaming businesses in Nevada have historically experienced lower revenues during the summer as a result of fewer tourists due to higher temperatures, as well as increased vacation activity by local residents. Rocky Gap typically experiences higher revenues during summer months and may be significantly adversely impacted by inclement weather during winter months. Our Nevada distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall which corresponds with several professional sports seasons. Our Montana distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall due to the inclement weather in the state and less opportunity for outdoor activities, in addition to the impact from professional sports seasons. While other factors like unemployment levels, market competition and the diversification of our business may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results.
Human Capital
Golden is committed to recruiting, developing and retaining a superior workforce. We have a long history and deep cultural commitment to service and authenticity. 
Employees and Collective Bargaining Agreements
As of December 31, 2020, we had over 6,700 employees, of which approximately 1,800 were covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Other unions may seek to organize the workers of our resort casino properties from time to time. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including those represented by unions. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its disruptive impact on our operations, we made significant reductions to our headcount and, during the period of the mandatory temporary property closures and suspension of our Distributed Gaming operations, placed over 90% of our team members on furlough status in order to preserve liquidity. We started bringing our team members back from furlough upon re-opening of our properties during the second quarter of 2020 and maintained a headcount of over 6,700 employees for the rest of the year, which represents over 80% of the pre-pandemic headcount. Further, during 2020, we devoted significant attention to the public health orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to protect our team members from potential COVID-19 exposure by implementing new protocols and processes to limit the spread of the virus. Such measures included the use of hand sanitizers and face coverings, enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols, temperature checks, testing and tracing and implementation of social distancing measures in restaurants, bars, and other food and beverage outlets, gaming floors, spas and pools, meeting rooms and other back-of-the house areas.
At The Strat, our employees are covered by four collective bargaining agreements. Our collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 501, AFL-CIO expires on March 31, 2021.
