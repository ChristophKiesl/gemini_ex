·
A global gate to gate understanding of flight operations with predictive “look ahead” capabilities facilitates proactive management of operations 
 
Government Policy
 
Focus on health and safety related to COVID 19
 Requirements for advance alerting of conditions that can create risks to public health due to unplanned or irregularly created operational conditions (such as congestion) that violate continuously evolving health regulations.
 
Emphasis on infrastructure spending.
 New commitments to large-scale aviation programs, including an upgraded technologies and services similar to those provided by PASSUR’s ARiVA™ platform.
 
Lower tolerance for severe disruptions.
 Changes in public policy in the form of expensive fines levied on airlines reflect this change of attitude. Consumers want better information relating to aviation and fewer delays.
 
Limiting carbon emissions becoming a greater focus.
 Airlines are increasingly sensitive to the industry’s carbon footprint. Several of the PASSUR solutions address both fuel savings as well as reductions in carbon emissions.
 
Surveillance and Data Standards
 
·
ADS-B has become the global standard for aircraft and vehicle position surveillance. PASSUR has established partnerships with multiple global, terrestrial and satellite ADS-B surveillance vendors, and has integrated those data feeds into ARiVA™. 
 
·
System Wide Information Management (SWIM) data standards have been adopted as a global standard for air traffic flow management (ATFM) data exchange. ARiVA™ is one of the major consumers of SWIM data, which is used by PASSUR’s machine learning algorithms.

Distribution Methods
 
The Company’s sales force is directly responsible for the sale of PASSUR solutions.
 
Competition
 
The Company’s ARiVA platform fuses global aircraft surveillance, airport and airspace data to provide airline, airport and ANSPs with situational awareness (flight tracking), predictive analytics, collaborative decision making (CDM) and workflow optimization solutions. ARiVA is a global, data driven, software as service platform which can be configured and implemented faster than competitive systems, with minimal capital investment, with costs proportional to the volume of operations. ARiVA’s core design integrating airline, airport and ANSP data, combined with its predictive analytics, collaboration and communication capabilities, enable all stakeholders to optimally participate in the CDM process.
 
There are other forms of surveillance, flight tracking, collaboration/communication and aviation business intelligence products on the market. Based on the various end uses of the Company’s products, primary competitors include Sabre, Saab-Sensis, The Weather Company/IBM, Harris Corporation, Amadeus, Thales, IDS, Metron, FlightAware, and Mosaic ATM. Many of these companies have larger sales forces and greater financial resources than the Company.
 
Source of Materials
 
The Company obtains computer and network components from multiple sources to obtain the majority of its components. The Company is heavily reliant on data subscriptions for surveillance, air navigation, etc. Some of these data sources have multiple providers, but other, which do not, are crucial in their respective regions, and the disruption to these data feeds would negatively affect service delivery.
Dependence on Certain Customers
 
The Company’s principal business is to provide predictive analytics and decision support technology for the aviation industry to primarily improve the operational performance and cash flow of its customers. The Company believes it operates in one operating segment. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Three customers accounted for 36%, or $4,176,000, of total revenues in fiscal year 2020. Of these three customers, one customer accounted for 13%, or $1,538,000. This customer was given concessions of approximately $513,000 during the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. It is unclear at this time whether or not the customer will renew its contract with the Company. A second customer accounted for 12%, or $1,440,000, and a third customer accounted for 10%, or $1,198,000, of total revenues in fiscal year 2020. Both of these customers terminated their contracts with the Company during the year. The same three customers accounted for 55%, or $8,296,000, of total revenues in fiscal year 2019. One customer accounted for 24% or $3,599,000, a second customer accounted for 20% or $2,985,000, and a third customer accounted for 11% or $1,713,000, of total revenues in fiscal year 2019.
 
As of October 31, 2020, the Company had four customers each of which accounted for 10% or more of the accounts receivable balance. One customer accounted for 38%, or $597,000, and three customers accounted for 10% each, with balances ranging from $151,000 to $159,000. As of October 31, 2019, the Company had three customers each of which accounted for 10% or more of the accounts receivable balance. The customer with the largest 2020 accounts receivable balance also accounted for 19%, or $224,000 of the 2019 balance, a second customer accounted for 14%, or $173,000, and a third customer accounted for 13% or $158,000. Credit losses historically have been immaterial. However, one major customer included above for fiscal 2020, had a significant past due accounts receivable balance, which the Company has fully reserved as of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
The Company is subject to governmental regulations on the use and distribution of flight-tracking data. The Company maintains strict security protocols for its data in order to comply with applicable governmental regulations.
 
In provision of its services, the Company utilizes data from government and commercial data sources. In particular, FAA SWIM and EUROCONTROL Business-to-Business (B2B) data services are heavily used. Many of the data elements received through these government data sources are augmented or backed up from commercial data sources. However, SWIM or B2B data interruptions would negatively affect ARiVA platform service delivery.
 
Environmental Costs
 
The Company is not aware of any environmental issues that would have a material adverse effect on future capital expenditures or current and future business operations.
