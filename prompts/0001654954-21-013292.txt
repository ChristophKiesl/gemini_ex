ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Our Company

General

We own and operate the nationally recognized CBD (cannabidiol) brands cbdMD, Paw CBD and cbdMD Botanicals. We believe that we are an industry leader producing and distributing broad spectrum CBD products and now full spectrum CBD products. Our mission is to enhance our customer’s overall quality of life while bringing CBD education, awareness and accessibility of high quality and effective products to all. We source cannabinoids, including CBD, which are extracted from non-GMO hemp grown on farms in the United States. Our innovative broad spectrum formula utilizes one of the purest hemp extracts, containing CBD, CBG and CBN, while eliminating the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Non-THC is defined as below the level of detection using validated scientific analytical methods. Our full spectrum products contain a variety of cannabinoids and terpenes in addition to CBD while maintaining trace amounts of THC that falls within the limits set in the 2018 Farm Bill. In addition to our core brands, we also operate cbdMD Therapeutics, LLC to capture the Company’s ongoing investments in science related to its existing and future products, including research and development activities for therapeutic applications

Our cbdMD brand of products includes over 130 SKUs of high-grade, premium CBD products, including CBD tinctures, CBD gummies, CBD topicals, CBD capsules, CBD bath bombs, CBD bath salts, and CBD sleep aids. 


Our Paw CBD brand of products includes over 45 SKUs of veterinarian-formulated products including tinctures, chews, topicals products in varying strengths and formulas. Paw CBD products have undergone the National Animal Safety Council’s rigorous audit and meet their Quality Seal standard. 

Our cbdMD Botanicals brand of beauty and skincare products features 15 SKUs, including facial oil and serum, toners, moisturizers, clear skin, facial masks, exfoliants and body care. cbdMD Botanicals is dedicated to creating clean CBD skin care products combining the best of Mother Nature with the precision of scientific innovation.

cbdMD, Paw CBD and cbdMD Botanicals products are distributed through our e-commerce websites, third party ecommerce sites, select distributors and marketing partners as well as a variety of brick and mortar retailers.

Recent Developments

We launched a number of key product categories during fiscal 2021. In January 2021 we announced the launch of cbdMD Botanicals, our new beauty and skincare line featuring 15 luxury products, including facial oil and serum, toners, moisturizers, clear skin, facial masks, exfoliants and body care and just this week launched our improved skincare. In addition, during September 2021 we launched a new full spectrum line of tincture and soft gels targeting an untapped customer base of consumers of full spectrum CBD, effectively doubling the total addressable market for CBD.

cbdMD’s products were again recognized as awarded 2021 Product of the Year Awards by a national survey organized by Kantar, a global leader in research. cbdMD serves as the first CBD company to win Product of the Year in consecutive years, earning 2021 top honors in “CBD Ingestible” for its CBD Gummies, while its Paw CBD brand secures category first “CBD Pet” award with its CBD Hard Chews for Dogs.

In July 2021, we acquired the assets of Twenty Two Capital, LLC (“Twenty Two”) d/b/a directcbdonline.com (“DCO”). This business operates a CBD marketplace through directcbdonline.com. In addition to the revenue contribution from this business we believe this acquisition will provide us with additional insight on consumer data and industry trends.

Growth Strategies

We continued to pursue many strategies to grow our revenues and expand the scope of our business in fiscal 2021 and beyond:


· | Product Innovation: Our goal is to provide our customers superior functional based products with greater efficacy, absorption and claims. We regularly assess and evaluate our product portfolio, and devote resources to ongoing research and development processes with the goal of expanding our product offerings to meet these expanding consumer demands. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we launched CBD lidocaine products including sprays, a CBD bath salt line, as well as our cbdMD Botanicals line of CBD skin care products. In April 2021 we announced our forthcoming 2021 product launches of which included an extension of our award-winning and best-selling gummies, as well as the first ever, and highly anticipated, cbdMD Drink Mixes. We successfully introduced our cbdMD Drink Mixes to the market during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. In June 2021 we launched an additional line of cbdMD sleep tinctures and softgels. In September 2021 we launched a new line of full spectrum tinctures and softgels. We have a robust pipeline of products to launch during fiscal 2022.

· | Expand our revenue channels: As the market continues to evolve, we are expanding our sales channels. During fiscal 2020, our wholesale business was impacted as the broader retail industry faced various headwinds tied to quarantining and COVID impacts. Despite this, we continued to pursue relationships with a number of key traditional retail accounts and believe our top brand awareness, effective marketing and strong balance sheet position us as the partner for CBD for key traditional retail accounts as this channel has continued to normalize during the fiscal year 2021 and the first part of fiscal year 2022. 
· | International Expansion: We continue to explore sales into markets outside of the United States. Our products are currently available in 31 countries. We generally partner with local wholesalers who can help navigate the laws and regulatory requirements within their jurisdiction. We continue to pursue key wholesale accounts in a number of international markets and are gaining market share in Central America through our sanitary registrations and are focused on expanding our E-commerce business to consumers in the U.K. At the end of December 2020, we announced the expansion of our direct-to-consumer operations into the United Kingdom (U.K.) which allows U.K. consumers to shop for our products online, with all orders shipping directly from a U.K. with based warehouse. In March 2021, we officially filed our Novel Food Application with the United Kingdom’s Food Standards Agency (“FSA”). The Application included all of the requisite data to allow for a validated submission and thorough scientific assessment. A similar submission was simultaneously made to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to ensure compliance for the European markets. During August 2021 we signed an exclusive agreement to enter Israeli Market with IM Cannabis Corp. a multi-country operator (“MCO”) in the medical and adult-use recreational cannabis sector with operations in Israel, Germany and Canada.

· | Expand our Additional Brands: During fiscal 2020 we saw the direct-to-consumer strength of cbdMD also translate into significant growth for Paw CBD. We continue to add internal resources to enhance this division. As this brand continues to grow, we are focusing on cross-selling, customer retention and education. During fiscal 2021 we took additional steps to grow the Paw CBD business which included advertising on TV, introducing our Paw CBD rewards program and introducing a Paw CBD subscription program which offers additional savings to customers that enroll in the service. During 2021 we launched cbdMD Botanicals as a separate brand and continue to build out the product portfolio and distribution channels.

· | Expand our sponsorships toward targeted segments: We have had significant success with attracting high profile sponsors and influencers and expect to continue to assess the segments we have covered with a focus on activation of the sponsorships and influencers which are producing the largest visibility and responsiveness. During 2021 we developed a key partnership with CrossFit. 
· | Acquisitions: We seek to acquire brands that we believe we can optimize through our internal digital marketing agency and supply chain platform while we broaden our product assortment and increase our total addressable market. Our scalable supply chain and fulfillment operation allows our brands to deliver an exceptional end-to-end experience to our customers in a cost-effective manner. We may acquire brands directly or through joint ventures if opportunities arise that we believe are in our best interest. In assessing potential acquisitions or investments, we expect to primarily utilize our internal resources to evaluate growth potential, the strength of the target brand, offerings of the target, as well as possible efficiencies to gain. We believe that this approach will allow us to effectively screen consumer brand candidates and strategically evaluate acquisition targets and efficiently complete due diligence for potential acquisitions. As referenced above, we recently acquired directcbdonline.com and related intellectual property. We are currently not a party to any additional agreements or understandings regarding the acquisition of additional brands or companies and there are no assurances we will be successful in expanding our brand portfolio.

Marketing

Our business model is designed first and foremost to build a strong brand as quickly as possible as we operate in an emerging CBD market. CBD is a relatively new market, we believe the cost to acquire customers is most likely at the lowest point it will be, therefore, as part of our overall strategy we started with an internet and online marketing strategy and have invested heavily in brand promotion and customer acquisition. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we spent approximately $17,902,673 and $14,972,052, respectively, on brand development, sponsorships and marketing.

We have organized our Marketing Department into an internal agency capable of servicing and scaling multiple brands, now including cbdMD, Paw CBD, and cbdMD Botanicals. We employ a category-leading, industry-innovating, multi-channel media approach that allows us to market our brand and products through various distribution efforts, which includes sports and athletes sponsorships, professional partnerships, social media engagement, podcasts, digital and television advertising, affiliate marketing, and influencer endorsements. According to the latest report from Brightfield Group, cbdMD ranks in the top 5 of Brand Share for the entire CBD category, as well as #1 in Brand Share for the second-largest Market Size category (Topicals - valued at $700M) and #1 in Brand Share for Beauty and Personal Care. 

We believe our partnerships with professional athletes are an effective way to build upon our already strong brand recognition in the category. We believe that our sponsorship and influencer partnerships which include partners such as 12-time PGA and two time Masters Champion Bubba Watson, NOBULL CrossFit Games and Bellator (MMA), a wholly owned subsidiary of CBS Viacom, Inc., are first-in-class in the CBD industry. We also have media partnerships in place with the Joe Rogan Experience and Barstool Sports podcasts among others. 

During Fiscal 2021 we continued to build Team cbdMD and leverage key sponsorships and partnerships in the sport world to build our brand and drive customer awareness. We renewed our partnership with Ken Block, professional rally and rallycross driver currently with the Hoonigan Racing division. In April 2021, we announced cbdMD signed an exclusive CBD sponsorship with highly decorated professional golfer, and 9-time PGA TOUR winner, Patrick Reed, to become the latest high profile member of Team cbdMD. As the brand of champions, Team cbdMD also added CrossFit champions Justin Medeiros and Annie Thorisdottir during fiscal 2021.

During fiscal 2021 we renewed our exclusive partnership with Viacom owned Bellator MMA, a leading mixed martial arts and kickboxing organization, including branding inside the Bellator cate, and signed a new exclusive sponsorship agreement to be the Official CBD Partner of the NOBULL CrossFit Games. In September 2021, we announced the signing of a three-year exclusive strategic partnership agreement with Troon, LLC, whereby Troon will provide promotional and marketing services to our company to help access distribution opportunities to the more than 600 Troon-affiliated facilities.

During the second quarter of 2021 our Pet brand, Paw CBD, debuted its first-ever national TV advertising campaign during the live broadcast of Puppy Bowl XVII, which aired on Sunday, February 7, 2021 before a national audience on Discovery+ and Animal Planet. In addition, we developed a second commercial that debuted April 1, 2021 for our core cbdMD brand.

Sales

We distribute our products both through our online sales channel as well as through a number of wholesalers and retailers that resell our products both in brick and mortar locations as well as via their online websites. Sales of our product primarily come from online sales at our websites www.cbdmd.com, www.pawcbd.com, cbdmdbotanicals.com and www.directcbdonline.com and through our inside sales department. Our inside sales team concentrates on B2B wholesale distributors, who we believe can help amplify our reach of cbdMD products at physical retail locations. 

During fiscal 2021, our e-commerce business experienced continued growth, with year over year increases in new e-commerce customers. For fiscal 2021, approximately 74% or sales were e-commerce as compared to approximately 73% in 2020. On the B2B brick and mortar side of the business, our level of stores we serve has grown to approximately 3,366 locations at the end of fiscal 2021 as we’ve seen COVID-19 related restrictions continue to be lifted and B2B brick and mortar distribution channels continue to bounce back. In addition, we acquired www.directcbdonline.com during 2021 and signed an exclusive sponsorship agreement to be the Official CBD Partner of the NOBULL CrossFit Games in 2021. The acquisition of www.directcbdonline.com, which has allowed us to own a CBD online marketplace that sells various CBD brands, provides a unique transparency to better understand consumer spending habits and trends across the wider CBD and hemp marketplace, as well as enhances our overall direct to consumer capabilities. Through our sponsorship of the NOBULL CrossFit Games, we have gained access to the CrossFit Games audience of 11 million worldwide viewers, including millions of members across 14,000 affiliated gyms in 158 countries.

Product manufacturing

We are committed to producing a quality product and testing transparency. Our goals include the optimization of our product manufacturing processes and the sourcing of reliable, high-quality raw materials. We only use cannabinoid extract from hemp grown in the United States in our products. We currently hold short term supply contracts with preferred vendors for our critical raw materials. Our preferred vendors are extractors and brokers who have access to the sources of the critical raw materials on the spot buy market to meet our growing demands for raw materials. All suppliers and farms must verify through our supplier verification program that their source material was grown using strict standards of cultivation which is confirmed through individual certificates of origin for all U.S. biomass used in production.

Our testing procedures are robust and comprehensive, starting with a supply chain built through our supplier verification program. All incoming cannabinoid ingredients are required to be first tested by the supplier at an independent, ISO accredited, third-party laboratory before they reach out production facilities and a Certificate of Analysis provided with each delivery. We then have the cannabinoid ingredients re-tested by the independent, ISO accredited, third-party laboratory to verify the supplier results before they are released into our production process. We test in-house throughout the production process before sending the finished goods off for final verification by an independent ISO accredited third-party laboratory to ensure the finished products of our broad spectrum products have no detectable THC, and meet our high standards for purity and CBD levels, while full spectrum product meets the requirements of the 2018 Farm Bill.

As a consumer good manufacturer dedicated to providing the highest quality CBD consumer products on the market, we strive to meet or exceed the FDAs Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. These guidelines provide a system of processes, procedures and documentation to assure a product has the identity, strength, composition, quality, and purity that appear on its label. We either manufacture our premium line of products at our Charlotte, NC facility or outsource to qualified third party manufacturers. Our manufacturing facility and warehouse operations encompass 120,000 square feet and are fully GMP compliant and NSF dietary supplements GMP. Quality products remains a key tenant of ours. During the second quarter we renewed our NSF GMP Manufacturing certification and underwent the US Hemp Authority audit, receiving our seal of approval on May 10, 2021. During fiscal 2021 we underwent the National Animal Supplement Counsel (“NASC”) Audit for our pet products and earned their prestigious Quality Seal Award. To accommodate our growth, we have also secured third party contract manufacturing from FDA-registered facilities which are independently GMP certified and subject to continuing independent audit and certification, to handle our increased manufacturing needs. 

Research and development and product enhancements

Our new product development efforts are focused on both near-term and long-term results for the company. The key objectives and input points that drive cbdMD’s research and development process include current product improvement efforts and new product development activities. Our product improvement efforts include consumer feedback analysis and feedback from panels of product testers, among others. We also conduct in-depth market research campaigns and sample size testing and research. Out new product development activities include market research, including future product trends and research to develop new product offerings, refinement of extraction and productions methods for product efficiency, ingredient research through sustainability testing, manufacturing process optimization, in-depth product testing, and package and graphic development. 

In March 2021, we announced the formation of Therapeutics for the purposes of isolating and quantifying the Company’s ongoing investments in science related to its existing and future products, including research and development activities for therapeutic applications. In June 2021, cbdMD Therapeutics announced Launch Of Animal Health Study In Collaboration With Colorado State University’s Veterinary Program to explore the effects of cbdMD’s proprietary cannabinoid blend on pets who suffer from osteoarthritis. Therapeutics has also commenced a preclinical human study with researchers at the University of South Carolina to explore the effects of cbdMD’s proprietary broad spectrum cannabinoid blend on sleep, mood, and pain in healthy subjects to further support the efficacy of the Company’s products and announced research partnership with the University of Mississippi to identify novel cannabinoids. 

We believe the formation of Therapeutics will assist us to identify and explore potential therapeutic uses for cannabinoids. The Company’s investments into therapeutics R&D will also benefit current products and dietary supplement development.

Intellectual property 

We hold a portfolio of U.S. trademark applications which are held for current and future product offerings and extended branding capability. The portfolio includes but is not limited to trademarks set forth below:


Mark | Federal registration No. | | Filing date | | Description of Mark Usage | 
------------------+--------------------------+----------+-------------+------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------------
DIRECT CBD ONLINE | | 6324509 | | 5/10/2019 | | Service mark 
DIRECT CBD ONLINE | | 6399287 | | 5/10/2019 | | Service mark

CBDMD | | 88944504 | | 6/2/2020 | | Standard word mark 


We currently hold a Madrid Protocol foreign trademark application for CBDMD (based on registration No. 88944504) and have secured or are in the midst of prosecuting the CBDMD trademark in the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, European Union, Spain, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We further have filed for trademark protection directly and have secured or in process of prosecuting in the following countries which are not a part in the Madrid Protocol: South Africa, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. Additionally, a growing number of our products hold sanitary registrations in certain Central and South American countries. 

In July 2020, we filed a new patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office which will allow us to pursue patented protection in several key areas, including novel formulations and delivery systems, as well as methods of manufacturing and use. This application is still pending.

In addition to our trademarks and our patent filing, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our product development, formulation and knowhow, as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our formulas and other proprietary information.

In addition to www.cbdmd.com, www.pawcbdmd.com, www.cbdmdbotanicals.com and www.directcbdonline.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registers or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business. 

Competition

The market for the sale of CBD-based products is fragmented and intensely competitive. Currently, in the United States, cbdMD does not believe that there are any businesses that can demonstrate or claim a dominant market share of the growing CBD products market. According to the Brightfield Group’s US CBD Market Landscape (October 2021), there are approximately 2,000 CBD brands in the US and the top 20 companies in our industry hold a combined 19% of market share. Our competitors of CBD-based products include a combination of public and private companies who operate as combination of ecommerce and wholesale brands as well as brick and mortar retail operations.

Government Regulations 

On December 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed the Farm Bill into law. Among other things, this new law changed certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.), and hemp products containing less than 0.3 percent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, including removing hemp and derivatives of hemp from the Controlled Substance Act. January 15, 2021 the USDA issued its final rule regarding the Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program which authorized hemp to be grown and processed legally in the United States and made it legal to transport in interstate commerce. 

The Farm Bill recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana, and specifically industrial hemp has been excluded from U.S. drug laws. The Farm Bill allows for each individual state to regulate industrial hemp and industrial hemp-based products or accept the USDA rules. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp (other than THC) are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We are actively monitoring the regulations and proposed regulations in each state to ensure our operations are compliant. 

In conjunction with the enactment of the Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the status of CBD and the agency’s actions in the short term with regards to CBD will guide the industry. The statement noted that the Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Farm Bill.

As of the date of this report, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies. The FDA, however, has sent warning letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products, only relating to instances that such CBD companies have made misleading and unapproved label claims. We will continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD. In December 2020, the FTC announced it was going to seek penalties against companies making deceptive marketing claims and named 6 companies which it had targeted for making egregious and unsupported health claims. On March 5, 2021the FTC approved the final administrative consent orders with all 6 companies. We are unaware of any further actions and we will continue to monitor the FTC’s position with regards to deceptive marketing claims. 

We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.

There is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. 

On March 26, 2021, we submitted a Novel Foods dossier with both the EU Food Safety Agency (FSA) and the United Kingdom’s Food Safety Agency (UK FSA). “Novel Foods” are foods which have not been widely consumed in the UK or the EU before May 1997. In December 2020 the EU FSA announced it would begin accepting Novel Food dossiers for CBD after suspending acceptance for most of the year. This change was due to a recent EU Court of Justice opinion ruling that certain hemp derived extracts should not be classified as narcotic controlled substances. Before a Novel Food can be marketed in the UK or EU, it is required to have a pre-market safety assessment and authorization. The UK has waived the pre-market requirement and is allowing post market submissions for products that were in the marketplace prior to February 2020, which qualifies our products. We worked in conjunction with a leading food safety and regulatory consultant in the UK to prepare the dossiers which included detailed analysis of the quality and stability of our products, our hemp sourcing and extraction controls, our labelling and testing requirements, and the underlying intake and toxicological data related to the safe consumption of the proprietary cannabinoid blend ingredients in our cbdMD product line. Since April 26, 2021, the UK Government has yet to provide the industry any material public feedback or clarity on industry wide submissions. The Company strongly believes its products will ultimately be approved once the administration delays in the UK are cleared.

Human Capital

At December 17, 2021 we had 154 full-time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.

We believe that cbdMD’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We believe that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.

Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.

Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.

ITEM 1.A RISK FACTORS.

Investing in our securities involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock and our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our securities.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS

We have a history of losses from operations and there are no assurances we will report profitable operations in future periods.

We reported losses from operations of $19,615,990 and $17,581,856 for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Not included in our loss from operations for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 is $0 and $48,983, respectively, associated with losses from our discontinued operations, and non-cash expense of $6,687,439 and non-cash income of $29,780,000 for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, reflecting a change in value of the contingent liability associated with the Earnout Shares (as hereinafter defined) primarily as a result of the change in the market price of our common stock. Until such time, if ever, that we are successful in generating gross profits which are sufficient to pay our operating expenses it is likely we will continue to report losses from operations in future periods.

Our recent growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth and we may not be able to effectively manage our growth. 

We have expanded our operations rapidly, especially over the last few years. Net sales increased $2.6 million, or 6%, to $44.5 million in 2021, compared to $41.9 million in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in total orders year over year. The increase in the number of orders was primarily due to our digital marketing strategy and by increased demand for CBD products. However, our historical growth rates are potentially not sustainable or indicative of future growth. We believe that our continued revenue growth will depend upon, among other factors: 


· | Increasing U.S. brand awareness; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our ability to obtain adequate protections for our intellectual property;
· | Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath; 
· | Product innovation to expand our total addressable market; 
· | International expansion. 


Disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic affected our business; however, this negative impact was offset by accelerating shift to online shopping that has continued through today, increasing our direct to consumer sales. These trends may not hold true in the future. 

We have a limited history operating our business at its current scale. As a result of our growth, our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased substantially, and we are continuing to implement policies and procedures that we believe are appropriate for a company of our size. We may experience difficulties as we continue to implement changes to our business and related policies and procedures to keep pace with our recent growth and, if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, in managing such growth and building the appropriate processes and controls in the future. Continued growth may increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including difficulties in sourcing, logistics, recruiting, maintaining internal controls, marketing, designing innovative products, and meeting consumer needs. If we do not adapt to meet these evolving challenges, the strength of our brand may erode, the quality of our products may suffer, we may not be able to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers, and our corporate culture may be harmed. 

In addition, we expect to make investments in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and internationally, design and develop new products, and enhance our existing products with newly developed products and through acquisitions. If our sales do not increase at a sufficient rate to offset these increases in our operating expenses, our profitability may decline in future periods.

During fiscal 2021 COVID-19 impacted our business and operations. Depending upon the continuing duration of the pandemic, it may adversely impact our results of operations in fiscal 2022 and beyond. 

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country have imposed varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including retail commerce. As a result of these circumstances, we have restricted schedules and staggered staffing at our corporate office and have altered work schedules at our warehouse and manufacturing facilities. In addition, many of our office personnel are working remotely. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we also began experiencing a decline in our sales to our B2B brick and mortar customers as many of the stores were temporarily or permanently closed. In response, we increased our marketing campaigns to support our e-commerce sales efforts by increasing our initiatives with associated relevant messaging to connect with our consumer base as well as increased website content and various offerings and changes to make online ordering more effective such as auto reorder capability, giveaways and free shipping. These efforts have allowed us to continue to increase sales by offsetting the decline in sales to B2B brick and mortar customers with a substantial increase in our e-commerce sales to consumers. Conditions caused by the continuing adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products or services, delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, adversely impact our ability to provide or deliver products and on-site services to our customers, delay the provisioning of our offerings, or lengthen payment terms, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. During second half of 2021, work schedules began returning to normal. With ongoing COVID variants, we continue to assess the situation on a regular basis and adjust our business, priorities, and processes to enable us to continue to operate effectively. We are unable to predict the future impact of COVID-19 and any subsequent variant and when, or if, our sales to B2B brick and mortar customers will return to prior levels.

The potential ETS concerning mandatory COVID-19 vaccination of employees could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced a proposed new rule requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require unvaccinated workers to get a negative test at least once a week. Effective November 5, 2021, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) issued a COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) which would require employers with 100 or more employees, by January 4, 2022, to require their workers either to be fully vaccinated (or at least have received a final dose of a primary vaccine series) or to test weekly for COVID-19. However, a federal district court has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting the U.S. government from enforcing the ETS mandate. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the exact impact the ETS would have on us in the event the injunction is lifted. As a company with more than 100 employees, in the event the injunction is lifted, we would be required to mandate COVID-19 vaccination of our workforce or our unvaccinated employees would require weekly testing. This may result in employee attrition, which could be material as substantially all of our employees reside in North Carolina where vaccination rates are below the national average. If we were to lose employees, it could have an adverse effect on future revenues and costs, which could be material. Accordingly, the proposed new regulation when implemented could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our business depends on maintaining and strengthening our brand and generating and maintaining ongoing demand for our products, and a significant reduction in such demand could harm our results of operations. 

We have developed a strong and trusted brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value and reputation of cbdMD. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our product offerings, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, the reliability and reputation of our supply chain, our ability to grow and capture share of the CBD category, and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality consumer experience. We have made substantial investments in these areas in order to maintain and enhance our brand and these experiences, but such investments may not be successful. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could materially adversely affect our business. For example, our business depends in part on our ability to maintain a strong community of engaged customers and social media and athlete influencers. We may not be able to maintain and enhance a loyal customer base if we receive customer complaints, negative publicity or otherwise fail to live up to consumers’ expectations, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and growth prospects. 

The growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brand or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brand and reputation. For example, consumer perception could be influenced by negative media attention regarding any consumer complaints about our products, our management team, ownership structure, sourcing practices and supply chain partners, employment practices, ability to execute against our mission and values, and our products or brand, such as any advertising campaigns or media allegations that challenge the sustainability of our products and our supply chain, or that challenge our marketing efforts regarding the quality of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, brand and reputation. Similar factors or events could impact the success of any brands or products we introduce in the future. 

Our company image and brands are very important to our vision and growth strategies, particularly our focus on being a “good company” and operating consistent with our mission and values. We will need to continue to invest in actions that support our mission and values and adjust our offerings to appeal to a broader audience in the future in order to sustain our business and to achieve growth, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our company and our brand, our sales and results of operations could be negatively impacted. Our brand and company image is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our consumers, customers, suppliers or manufacturers, including adverse publicity or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

If we fail to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner, our business may be harmed. 

A large part of our success depends on our ability to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner. We have made, and may continue to make, significant investments in attracting new customers through increased advertising spends on social media, radio, podcasts, and targeted email communications, other media and events, sponsorships, and influencer sponsorships. Marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers. Further, as our brand becomes more widely known, future marketing campaigns may not attract new customers at the same rate as past campaigns and the cost of acquiring new customers may increase over time. Additionally, regulation, algorithms, or participants in the digital marketing ecosystem may change rules for our industry or access to available demographics which may result in significant changes in the ability to target key demographic pools, impacting our ability to target our customers effectively. If we are unable to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business may be harmed. 

Our growth depends, in part, on expanding into additional consumer markets, and we may not be successful in doing so. 

We believe that our future growth depends not only on continuing to provide our current customers with new products, but also continuing to enlarge our customer base. The growth of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to expand in the United States, as well as into international markets. We are investing significant resources in these areas, and although we hope that our products will gain popularity, we may face challenges that are different from those we currently encounter, including competitive, merchandising, distribution, hiring, and other difficulties. We may also encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of consumer familiarity with or acceptance of our brand, or a resistance to paying for premium products, particularly in international markets. In addition, although we are investing in sales and marketing activities to further penetrate newer regions, including expansion of our dedicated sales force, we may not be successful. If we are not successful, our business and results of operations may be harmed. 

Our plans for international expansion may not be successful. 

Continued expansion into markets outside the United States is one of our key long-term strategies for the future growth of our business. This expansion requires significant investment of capital and human resources, new business processes and marketing platforms, legal compliance, and the attention of many managers and other employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. There are significant costs and risks inherent in selling our products in international markets, including: (a) failure to effectively establish our core brand identity; (b) increased employment costs; (c) increased shipping and distribution costs, which could increase our expenses and reduce our margins; (d) potentially lower margins in some regions; (e) longer collection cycles in some regions; (f) increased competition from local providers of similar products; (g) compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including taxes and duties, laws governing the marketing and use of e-commerce websites and enhanced data privacy laws and security, rules, and regulations; (h) establishing and maintaining effective internal controls at foreign locations and the associated increased costs; (i) increased counterfeiting and the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad; (j) compliance with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws, such as the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and OFAC regulations, by us, our employees, and our business partners; (k) currency exchange rate fluctuations and related effects on our results of operations; (l) economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign economies and markets; (m) compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; (n) workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; (o) business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, fires, and public health issues, including the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, or xenophobia resulting therefrom; (p) the imposition of tariffs on products that we import into international markets that could make such products more expensive compared to those of our competitors; (q) that our ability to expand internationally could be impacted by the intellectual property rights of third parties that conflict with or are superior to ours; (r) difficulty developing retail relationships; and (s) other costs and risks of doing business internationally. 

These and other factors could harm our international operations and, consequently, harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our planned international expansion, and it may not be successful. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in new markets. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into international markets because of limited brand recognition, leading to delayed or limited acceptance of our products by customers in these markets, and increased marketing and customer acquisition costs to establish our brand. Accordingly, if we are unable to successfully expand internationally or manage the complexity of our global operations, we may not achieve the expected benefits of this expansion and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. 

Fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, equipment, labor, and transportation could cause manufacturing delays or increase our costs. 

The price and availability of key components used to manufacture our products has been increasing and may continue to fluctuate significantly. In addition, the cost of labor within our company or at our third-party manufacturers could increase significantly due to regulation or inflationary pressures. Additionally, the cost of logistics and transportation fluctuates in large part due to the price of oil, and availability can be limited due to political and economic issues. Any fluctuations in the cost and availability of any of our raw materials, packaging, or other sourcing or transportation costs could harm our gross margins and our ability to meet customer demand. If we are unable to successfully mitigate a significant portion of these product cost increases or fluctuations, our results of operations could be harmed. 

We rely on third-parties for raw materials and to manufacture and compound some of our products. We have no control over these third parties and if these relationships are disrupted our results of operations in future periods will be adversely impacted.

We currently hold short term supply contracts with unaffiliated third-party vendors for our critical raw materials. In addition, some of our products are manufactured or compounded by unaffiliated third parties and the use of these third-party co-packers changes from time to time due to customer demand and the composition of our product mix and product portfolio. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of these third parties, and we expect to compete with other companies for raw materials, production and imported packaging material capacity. If we experience significant increased demand or need to replace an existing raw material supplier or third-party manufacturer, there can be no assurances that replacements for these third-party vendors will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any manufacturer or compounder would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to engage third parties. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in raw materials and/or the manufacturing or compounding of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term.


12


Failures in our third-party verification and testing protocols may have an adverse impact on our brands which could suppress sales.

The quality of our products is essential to our business strategy. We require our raw material suppliers and farms to participate in our supplier verification program and to certify that their source material was grown using strict standards of cultivation. We also employ third-party testing procedures and all incoming cannabinoid ingredients are first tested by an independent, third-party laboratory before they reach our production facilities and then re-tested in-house throughout the production process before sending the ingredients off for final verification by an independent accredited third-party laboratories. We are reliant on these third parties to adhere to our supplier verification program and properly perform the third-party testing procedures. Any intentional or unintentional failure of any of these parties to perform the functions for which we have engaged them would adversely impact the quality of our products and could result in delays in meeting consumer demand or a decline in our sales.

We could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches.

Some of our systems have experienced past security incidents, including a recent incident that compromised some customers' personal and payment information. We conducted a forensic examination, made all notices to customers, governments, banks and card associations as required under local, state and federal laws, merchant agreements and card association rules. We also offered free credit monitoring and reporting to all affected customers and are maintaining a call center to handle any customer issues. We have implemented all remedial measures advised by the forensic examiner engaged by us, and, although we do not believe that any of these incidents have had a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance the remedial measures will be effective or of a similar result in the future which could materially and adversely impact our business and operations in future periods.

We face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy.

From time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and product sales unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which could adversely impact our net sales and the attractiveness of our products. If we are unable to add software and hardware as needed, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, these failures could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results in future periods. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders which could make our product offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.

Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our management and key employees, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management. 

We depend on the talents and continued efforts of our senior management and key employees. The loss of members of our management or key employees may disrupt our business and harm our results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to manage further expansion will require us to continue to attract, motivate, and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, integrating, and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business effectively. There can be no assurance that our current management team, or any new members of our management team, will be able to successfully execute our business and operating strategies. 

If our goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to our earnings. 

We may be required to record future impairments of goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets to the extent the fair value of these assets falls below their book value. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions regarding future cash flows, gross margins, expenses, discount rates applied to these cash flows, and current market estimates of value. Estimates used for future sales growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate fair value could cause us to record material non-cash impairment charges, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

The implementation of a new accounting system could interfere with our business and operations.

We will be implementing a new ERP system in fiscal 2022. The ERP implementation will encompass accounting, production, warehouse and customer resource management activities. The implementation of new systems and enhancements may be disruptive to our business and can be time consuming and divert management’s attention. Any disruptions relating to our systems or any problems with the implementation, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period, could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.

RISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR CBD

Changes to Federal or state laws pertaining to industrial hemp could slow the use of industrial hemp which would materially impact our revenues in future periods.

As of the date hereof, approximately 46 states have authorized industrial hemp programs pursuant to the United States of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, commonly known as the “Farm Bill,” or under prior programs authorized under the 2014 Farm Bill, or have plans under review by the USDA. Effective January 1, 2022 several states without an approved plan under the Farm Bill, or a plan under review, will default to the USDA Hemp Producer License. Continued development of the industrial hemp industry will be dependent upon new legislative authorization of industrial hemp at the state level, and further amendment or supplementation of legislation at the federal level. Any number of events or occurrences could slow or halt progress all together in this space. While progress within the industrial hemp industry is currently encouraging, growth is not assured. While there appears to be ample public support for favorable legislative action, numerous factors may impact or negatively affect the legislative process(es) within the various states where we have business interests. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use of industrial hemp, which could negatively impact the business up to possibly causing us to discontinue operations as a whole. In addition, changes in Federal or state laws could require us to alter the way we conduct our business in order to remain compliant with applicable state laws in ways we are presently unable to foresee. These possible changes, if necessary, could be costly and may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods.


13


Costs associated with compliance with numerous laws and regulations could impact our financial results. In addition, we could become subject to increased litigation risks associated with the CBD industry.

The manufacture, labeling and distribution by us of the hemp-based cannabinoid products is regulated by various federal, state and local agencies. These governmental authorities may commence regulatory or legal proceedings, which could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims or the ability to sell products in the future. We are subject to regulation by the federal government and other state and local agencies as a result of our hemp-based cannabinoid products. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance in multiple jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to our company, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect the ability to operate our business and our financial results. Failure to comply with the various federal, state and local requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. We are seeing increasing state-level labeling requirements that may increase our costs with respect to monitoring and adhering to unique label requirements in addition to potential product and packaging obsolescence costs. Our advertising is subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act, and is subject to various state regulations enforced by state agencies and state attorneys general. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labeling laws to be enforced by private attorneys general who may seek relief for consumers, seek class-action certifications, seek class-wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any actions against our company by governmental authorities or private litigants could be time consuming, costly to defend and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Uncertainty caused by potential changes to legal regulations could impact the use of CBD products.

There is substantial uncertainty and different interpretations among federal, state and local regulatory agencies, legislators, academics and businesses as to the scope of operation of Farm Bill-compliant hemp programs relative to the emerging regulation of cannabinoids. These different opinions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of cannabinoids by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and/or the FDA and the extent to which manufacturers of products containing Farm Bill-compliant cultivators and processors may engage in interstate commerce. The uncertainties cannot be resolved without further federal, and perhaps even state-level, legislation, regulation or a definitive judicial interpretation of existing legislation and rules. If these uncertainties continue, they may have an adverse effect upon the introduction of our products in different markets.

RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR SECURITIES

The impact of changes in the fair value of our non-cash contingent liabilities associated with the Earnout Shares has, and may continue to, materially impact our results of operations in future periods.

As described in Note 6 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report, at September 30, 2021, we have a contractual obligation to issue up to an additional 5,708,135 shares of our common stock (the “Earnout Shares”) as additional consideration for our acquisition of Cure Based Development LLC in December 2018. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) we are required to record a non-cash contingent liability associated with the Earnout Shares and at September 30, 2021, the total of this contingent liability was $9,440,000. Under GAAP we are obligated to reassess the obligations associated with the Earnout Shares on a quarterly basis and, in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes, we will record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to earnings. In particular, changes in the market price of our common stock, which is one of the inputs used in determining the amount of the non-cash contingent liability, will result in increases or decreases in this liability and positively or negatively impact our net loss or profit for the period. The application of the accounting treatment for the fair valuing of the Earnout Shares, in addition to the issuance of earnout shares for the first, second, third and fourth marking periods, at September 30, 2021 resulted in a decrease in the amount of this non-cash contingent liability of $6,760,000 for fiscal 2021 as compared to an increase of $29,780,000 for fiscal 2020. While we do not believe investors should place undue reliance on the impact of these non-cash changes when evaluating our results of operations in future periods, as they have no impact on the operations of the business, we expect that the fair valuing of the Earnout Shares will continue to have a material impact on our results of operations and our shareholders’ equity in future periods, which may materially impact the market price of our securities. 

Also as described in Note 8 to the notes of our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report, at September 30, 2021, we have a contractual obligation to issue up to an additional 200,000 shares of our common stock (the “Twenty Two Earnout Shares”) as additional consideration for our acquisition of www.DirectCBDOnline.com in July 2021. Under GAAP we are required to record a non-cash contingent liability associated with the Twenty Two Earnout Shares and at the date of the acquisition, recorded a total contingent liability of $488,561. Under GAAP we are obligated to reassess the obligations associated with the Twenty Two Earnout Shares on a quarterly basis and, in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes, we will record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to earnings. In particular, changes in the market price of our common stock, which is one of the inputs used in determining the amount of the non-cash contingent liability, will result in increases or decreases in this liability and positively or negatively impact our net loss or profit for the period. At September 30, 2021, we recorded a decrease in value of the contingent liability of $73,561 related to a decrease in the market price of our common stock, which adjusted the total contingent liability related to the Twenty Two Earnout Shares to $416,000.

The issuances of the Earnout Shares will significantly dilute our existing shareholders.

The possible issuance of the remaining Earnout Shares will increase our issued and outstanding shares of common stock by approximately 10%. In addition, assuming the possible issuance of all of the additional remaining 5,708,135 Earnout Shares but giving effect to no other change to the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, the members of Cure Based Development from the merger, which includes Mr. R. Scott Coffman, and Mr. Martin Sumichrast, our co-CEO’s and members of our board of directors, would own approximately 35% of our then outstanding shares of common stock. The issuance of all or a portion of the Earnout Shares will dilute the ownership interests of our common shareholders and may adversely impact the market price of our common stock. The Twenty Two Earnout Shares may further add to this dilution.

The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities and is effectively junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.

In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue (subject to Series A Convertible Preferred Stockholder approval) that ranks senior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our existing subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and any future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.

We may not be able to pay dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

Our ability to pay cash dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock requires us to (i) either be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or (ii) have total assets that are greater than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Further, notwithstanding these factors, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described in this report were to occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, including the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income.”

Distributions paid to corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income,” if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We do not currently have any accumulated earnings and profits. Additionally, we may not have sufficient current earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distributions fail to qualify as dividends, U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income.” If any distributions on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to any fiscal year are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction or preferential tax rates applicable to “qualified dividend income” because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that the market value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock might decline.

The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents perpetual equity interests in us, and investors should not expect us to redeem or convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on the date the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock becomes redeemable or convertible by us or on any particular date afterwards.

The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents perpetual equity interests in our company, and it has no maturity or mandatory redemption except upon a Change of Control, and is not redeemable at the option of investors under any other circumstances. A “Change of Control” will generally be deemed to occur when, after the original issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to be a “person” under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, of beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions which were pre-approved by our board of directors of our stock entitling that person to exercise more than 50% of the total voting power of all of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of the our directors, subject to certain exclusions. As a result, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will not give rise to a claim for payment of any amount at a particular date. As a result, holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock for an indefinite period of time unless the holder chooses to voluntarily convert the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock.

Change of Control redemption obligations of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may make it more difficult for a party to acquire us or discourage a party from acquiring us.

The Change of Control redemption feature of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying, deferring or preventing certain of change of control transactions under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price of such stock or that shareholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests.

A holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has extremely limited voting rights.

The voting rights for a holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are limited. Our shares of common stock are the only class of our securities that carry full voting rights. Holders of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights other than as set forth below in the next two sentences or unless dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are in arrears for each of 12 or more consecutive monthly periods, in which case the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote as a separate class for the election of two additional directors to serve on the board of directors until all dividends that are owed have been paid. Holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a class, are also entitled to vote if we should seek to issue or create any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to dividends or distributions, in which event the consent of holders of at least two thirds of the then outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is required. The consent of the holders of a majority of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, voting as a class, is required if we were to seek to adopt any amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws that would materially affect existing terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or increase the number of authorized shares of that series, other than in connection with the anti-dilution provisions, or if we seek to create a series or class which ranks pari passu with the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Other than these limited circumstances and except to the extent required by law, holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights.

We may redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at our option, we will be required to redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control and we may convert shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock upon a Market Trigger into shares of our common stock. In the event of any of these occurrences, you may not receive dividends that you anticipate.

On or after October 16, 2023 we may, at our option, redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. In addition, upon the occurrence of a board approved Change of Control, we are required to redeem any or all of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $11.00 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the redemption date. Furthermore, upon a Market Trigger (as that term is defined in the designations, rights and preferences of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock), we may convert all or any portion of those shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock. We may have an incentive to redeem or convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend rate on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. If we redeem or convert the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, then from and after the redemption date or conversion date, as applicable, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights as a holder of those shares will terminate, including the rights to receive dividend payments.

The liquidation preference of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock would reduce the amount available to our common shareholders in the event of our liquidation or winding up.

Holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock have a liquidation preference of $10.00 per share in the event of our liquidation or winding up. This means that those holders are entitled to receive the liquidation preference before any payment or other distribution of assets to our common shareholders, and the amount of any such payment or other distribution will be reduced by that amount.

The issuance of shares upon exercise of our outstanding options, restricted stock awards and warrants, or the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.

In addition to our obligation to issue the Earnout Shares if the goals are met, we presently have options, unvested restricted stock awards and warrants that if exercised would result in the issuance of an additional 4,175,417 shares of our common stock, and our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is presently convertible into an additional 8,335,000 shares of common stock. The issuance of shares upon exercise of warrants and options and/or the conversion of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will result in dilution to the interests of other shareholders.

Mr. Sumichrast may not devote his full time and attention to our company.

Mr. Sumichrast, our co-Chief Executive Officer, has business interests outside our company, including serving as a member of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of a company that has recently filed a registration statement with the SEC for its initial public offering. Accordingly, from time to time he may not devote his full time and attention to our affairs. There are no assurances that our business and operations may not be adversely impacted in future periods as a result of the time he may devote to his other business interests instead of a sole focus by him on the affairs of our company.

Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates may exert control over us and may exercise influence over matters subject to shareholder approval.

Our executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 31% of our outstanding common stock as of December 1, 2021. Accordingly, these shareholders, if they act together, may exercise substantial influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control over us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.
