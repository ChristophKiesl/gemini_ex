The following discussion, as well as other portions of this Comprehensive Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.  Any such forward-looking statements (including, but not limited to, statements to the effect that Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. (“TLFA”) or its management “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,” “expects,” “believes,” “intends,” and other similar expressions) that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report.  These forward-looking statements are made based upon management’s current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and should be read carefully because they involve risks and uncertainties.  We assume no obligation to update or otherwise revise these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  Specific examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our forecasts of financial performance, share repurchases, store openings or store closings, capital expenditures and working capital requirements.  Our actual results could materially differ from those discussed in such forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Comprehensive Form 10-K and particularly in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this Comprehensive Form 10-K to “TLFA,” “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” “Tandy,” or “Tandy Leather” mean Tandy Leather Factory, Inc., together with its subsidiaries.
 
General
 
Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. is one of the world’s largest specialty retailers of leather and leathercraft-related items.  Founded in 1919 in Fort Worth, Texas, the Company introduced leathercrafting to millions of American and later Canadian and other international customers and has built a track record as the trusted source of quality leather, tools, hardware, supplies, kits and teaching materials for leatherworkers everywhere.  Today, our mission remains to build on our legacy of inspiring the timeless art and trade of leatherworking.
 
What differentiates Tandy from the competition is our high brand awareness and strong brand equity and loyalty, our network of retail stores that provides convenience, a high-touch customer service experience, a hub for the local leathercrafting community, and our 100-year heritage.  We believe that this combination of qualities is unique to Tandy and gives the brand competitive advantages that are very difficult for others to replicate.
 
We sell our products primarily through company-owned stores and through orders generated from our four websites: tandyleather.com, tandyleather.ca, tandyleather.eu and tandyleather.com.au. We also manufacture leather lace, cut leather pieces and most of the do-it-yourself kits that are sold in our stores and on our websites.  We maintain our principal offices at 1900 Southeast Loop 820, Fort Worth, Texas 76140.  
 
As of August 13, 2020, Nasdaq suspended trading in the Company’s stock on Nasdaq due to the Company not being current with its SEC filings. Our stock has since traded on the OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Group under the symbol “TLFA.”  Nasdaq denied the Company’s appeal of its decision to suspend trading in the Company’s stock and the Company’s stock was formally delisted on February 9, 2021.  We intend to reapply for Nasdaq listing after we have made our required Exchange Act filings, including the Delinquent Filings.  Any such listing would be subject to Nasdaq approval.

Retail Fleet
 
As of December 31, 2019, the Company operated a total of 115 retail stores.  There were 103 stores in the United States (“U.S,”), 11 stores in Canada and one store in Spain.  All e-commerce sales through our websites were fulfilled and recognized through our network of retail stores.
 
The Company operates a total of 106 retail stores as of May 2021.  There are 95 stores in the U.S., ten stores in Canada and one store in Spain.  During the second quarter of 2020, we consolidated U.S. e-commerce web order fulfillment from the stores to our Fort Worth distribution center.
 
All Tandy locations, other than our corporate headquarters (which includes our flagship store, corporate offices, distribution center, and manufacturing facility) are leased.
 
Business Strategy
 
New management joined the Company in October 2018 and set new strategic directions for both the short and long term.  The overarching goal for 2019 and 2020 was to invest in rebuilding a foundation for growth by: 1) improving our brand proposition, 2) reversing the sales decline with business customers, 3) building our talent, processes, tools and systems and 4) positioning us for long-term growth.
 
Key initiatives in 2019 and 2020 included:
 

◾ | Simplifying and centralizing the pricing strategy, reducing the number of complex price levels, and creating a balance between everyday-low-prices (“EDLP”) and planned promotional events;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Enhancing our customer proposition with an upgraded web platform and experience, new branding and assortment architecture, and community-building initiatives;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Improving the quality and assortment of the product offering to better appeal to more advanced leather-crafters and business customers and improving leather quality and consistency with a new in-house leather quality assurance process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Assessing our retail stores based on a forecast of long-term four-wall cash flow. Managing the fleet (store moves, closures, renewals) based on that forecast, which resulted in the closure of five stores in 2019 and one in early 2020, including stores in both Australia and the United Kingdom (“UK”), which were all cash flow negative and not strategic to ongoing operations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Investing in retail talent with a focus on training and development, performance evaluations, promotion from within, career paths, achievable and controllable bonus structures, base pay reflective of geographic differences in cost-of-living, and a flattened organizational structure; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Building the Commercial Program - a team focused on the Company’s largest customers with a business model that meets these customers’ unique needs including dedicated sales representatives, clear and competitive volume-based pricing, personalized service and sourcing, shipping directly to customers from our distribution center, and improved product consistency, quality and availability; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Building the organization, processes, infrastructure, tools and systems to efficiently execute these strategies. This included recruiting key talent with deep retail know-how, replacing decades-old systems (general ledger, point-of-sale, warehouse management and web) with modern tools, and building key best-practices across the company; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Evaluating opportunities to grow the company with new store locations and formats, category growth and strategic partnerships.

Although we made progress against these initiatives throughout 2019, the onset of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic in March 2020 temporarily shifted our strategic focus to company survival and cash preservation.  Tandy temporarily closed all stores by the end of March 2020, furloughed a majority of its employees, and extended payment terms on suppliers.  Some landlords granted rent abatements and deferrals for the months of April, May and June 2020, which assisted with our cash position and preservation.
 
Web order fulfillment in the U.S. was consolidated from the stores to our Fort Worth distribution center at the end of March 2020, enabling us to continue to meet our customers’ product needs and generating sales even when our stores were closed.   U.S. and some international web orders since are fulfilled centrally from our distribution center and web sales represent a larger proportion of our sales than they did before the pandemic, even after our stores have reopened.
 
During the second quarter of 2020, as leases expired or early terminations were negotiated, we permanently closed eight stores where we believed we can retain a majority of customers through geographically proximate stores and/or our enhanced website platform.  After these permanent closures, 106 stores remained, including ten in Canada and one in Spain.  During the third quarter of 2020, all 106 of Tandy’s stores had reopened to the public and the store re-openings were well received by our employees and customers.  During the fourth quarter of 2020 through the present, we have continued to manage through the pandemic as we have seen periodic spikes in COVID-19 infections and have been forced to close certain stores or move certain stores to “curbside only” operations.
 
Tandy began 2020 with a good cash position.  The sharp reduction in sales associated with COVID-related store closures, especially in the second quarter of 2020, mitigated by aggressive cost management, resulted in a decline in our cash reserve.  While the stability of our operating environment has improved significantly relative to the end of March and the second quarter of 2020, the current economic environment remains very risky and highly volatile.  We have retained a high degree of flexibility to react to changes in market conditions, but there is no assurance we can avoid additional detrimental impacts to our financial position, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations in 2021 and beyond.  The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the effectiveness and acceptance of newly developed vaccines, the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.  This situation continues to evolve, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.
 
Customers
 
Prior to 2019, we defined our customers in a number of different groups, the largest two being Retail, primarily hobbyists, and Business, small and medium-sized businesses.  However, through customer research over the last two years and better understanding of past practices used to categorize customers into these groups, the Company determined that there was insufficient distinction between such categories. We are continuing to assess and evolve our thinking on customer segments with a focus on levels of annual and lifetime spend.
 
To address the opportunity among the largest customers, in 2019 we launched a Commercial Program designed to better meet the needs of these customers.  The program is comprised of dedicated outside sales representatives, clear and competitive volume-based pricing, personalized service and sourcing, shipping directly to customers from our distribution center, and improved product consistency, quality and availability.

Merchandise
 
We carry a wide assortment of products organized into a number of categories including leather, hand tools, hardware, kits, liquids, machinery and other supplies.  We operate a manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas, where we manufacture kits, thread lace, belt strips and straps, and Craftaid®s, and provide some custom manufacturing processes for commercial and business customers.  The factory produces approximately 10% of our products.  We distribute product under the Tandy LeatherTM, Eco-FloTM, CraftoolTM, CraftoolProTM and Dr. Jackson’sTM brands, along with our recently launched TandyPro® products.  We develop and invest in new products through the ideas and referrals of customers and store personnel as well as the analysis of trends in the market and sales performance at retail.  In addition, we have been focused on broadening our assortment through strategic partnerships with key brands to drive category growth and better meet the needs of our customers.
Operations
 
As of January 1, 2019, we operate as a single segment and report on a consolidated basis.  Prior to January 1, 2019, we operated and reported in two segments - North America and International.  In early 2019, we announced several strategic initiatives to drive future sales growth and long-term profitability, which resulted in the Company closing two of its three stores outside of North America.  This left Spain as our only store outside of North America, and our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) was no longer making operating performance assessments and resource allocation decisions for this single store.  As a result, we no longer report International as a reportable segment.  All prior year data discussed throughout this Comprehensive Form 10-K has been retrospectively revised to conform to the new single-reportable segment structure.  There is no change to our consolidated financial position or results based on the change in segment reporting.
 
Our stores offer a broad selection of products combined with leathercraft expertise in a one-stop shop.  Not only can customers purchase leather, related accessories and supplies necessary to complete their projects from a single source, but many of our store associates are also leathercrafters themselves and can provide suggestions and advice on our customers’ projects.  Customers value the expertise and high level of customer service from our store associates, the convenience of taking their purchases immediately, as well as the ability to touch, feel and choose their individual pieces of leather, an organic product in which each piece is unique.  We also offer open workbenches where customers can work on projects, take classes, commune with the leathercrafting community, and test new tools and techniques.
 
Most of our stores range in size from 1,300 square feet to 9,000 square feet, with the average at approximately 3,500 square feet, and our Fort Worth flagship store is approximately 22,000 square feet.  Stores are located in light industrial warehouse spaces or older strip shopping centers in proximity to major freeways or well-known crossroads.  We believe that many of our customers view our stores as a destination: customers interested in leathercrafting seek us out, reducing the value of paying high rents for high foot-traffic locations.
 
Historically, we generate slightly more sales in the fourth quarter of each year due to the holiday shopping season (approximately 28-30% of annual sales), while the other three quarters average approximately 22-24% of annual sales each quarter.

Distribution
 
Our stores receive the majority of their inventory from our central distribution center located in Fort Worth, Texas, in weekly shipments, using third party logistics providers.  Occasionally, merchandise is shipped directly from the vendor.  Starting in March 2020, with the store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to fulfill web orders from our distribution center in Fort Worth.  Prior to 2020, web orders were fulfilled by the store based upon availability.  This required building a new direct-to-consumer pick, pack and ship process supplemented by our new web and shipping platform, which rolled out in June 2020.  We also expanded our customer service team to handle web order inquiries and take phone orders.
 
Historically, we attempted to maintain the optimum number of items in our product line to minimize out-of-stock situations against carrying costs involved with such an inventory level.  We generally maintain higher inventories of imported items, to ensure a continuous supply.  In 2019, we tested our suppliers’ ability to replenish more rapidly and to commit to on-time deliveries to allow lower overall inventory levels and found that out-of-stocks were at a level we viewed as unacceptable.  Since 2019, we have also been executing against a number of strategic initiatives to improve our product assortment, test new items online, and tailor product assortments to the needs of local customers in each store.  We carry about 6,500 stock-keeping units (SKUs) in our current product line and continue to refine both the line, the lead times and safety stock levels required to meet customer demand, online vs. in-store assortment, and overall total inventory levels needed to grow sales and market share.
 
Competition
 
Our competitors are typically smaller, independently-owned brick-and-mortar retailers, internet-based retailers including those selling on platforms like Amazon and eBay, national craft chains like Michaels Stores, Inc. and Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., and some wholesale-focused distributors.  Virtually all of these competitors carry a more limited line of leathercraft products compared to Tandy.  We are competitive on convenience, price, availability of merchandise, customer service, depth of our product line, and delivery time.  Tandy Leather is the only multi-store chain specializing in leathercraft, which we believe provides a competitive advantage over internet-based retailers and the large general craft retailers.  We also believe that our large size relative to most competitors gives us an advantage in sourcing as well as deep product and leathercrafting expertise among our employees.
Suppliers
 
We purchase merchandise and raw materials from over 100 vendors from the United States and approximately 20 foreign countries.  In general, our 10 largest vendors account for approximately 60-75% of our inventory purchases.
 
Because leather is sold internationally, market conditions abroad are likely to affect the price of leather in the United States.  Aside from increasing purchases when we anticipate price increases (or possibly delaying purchases if we foresee price declines), we do not attempt to hedge our inventory costs.
 
Our supply chain and vendor relationships remain strong.  We are focused on continuing to align our product and sourcing strategies to elevate the overall quality, consistency, and agility to meet the diverse needs of our existing consumers and attract new ones to the brand.  COVID-19 has had varying impacts on our supply chain in 2020 through the present, as the course of the disease has impacted countries differently over time.  During the early months of the pandemic, we experienced longer lead times in Asia, but later, we have faced reduced capacity in Brazil and Europe, and recently a near shut-down in India.  Availability of shipping containers, especially in Asia, continues to be challenging.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2019, we employed 578 people, 457 of whom were employed on a full-time basis.  As of April 30, 2021, we employed 561 people, 460 of whom are employed on a full-time basis.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.  Overall, we believe that relations with employees are good.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all Tandy-branded products.  In addition, we license a limited number of our trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition co-branded projects.  Major trademarks include federal trade name registrations for “Tandy Leather Factory,” “Tandy Leather Company,” and “Tandy.”  The Company is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent, although it believes that the “Tandy” and “Tandy Leather” names are important for its business.  In addition, Tandy owns several patents for specific belt buckles and leather-working equipment.  Tandy polices its trademarks and trade dress, and where appropriate pursues infringers.  The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them.
