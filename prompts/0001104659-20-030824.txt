Item 1.   BusinessHistory
We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998 for the purpose of operating and acquiring rural local exchange carriers (“RLECs”). Since 1999, we have acquired eleven RLEC businesses, four of which serve contiguous territories in north central Alabama; three of which serve territories adjacent to either Portland or Bangor, Maine; and one each serving a portion of western Massachusetts, central Missouri, western Vermont and southern West Virginia. In addition to traditional telephone services, we provide a variety of unregulated telecommunications services in all of our RLEC territories, including internet data lines and long distance services. We have also acquired three facilities-based competitive local exchange carriers (“CLECs”), which offer services primarily to business and enterprise customers in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and have historically operated under the trade name OTT Communications. The Company completed an initial public offering in December 2004, at which time it converted from a Delaware limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Otelco Inc. In 2018, we transitioned to using the brand name Otelco in all locations where we provide service. 
 Our RLEC companies trace their history to the introduction of telecommunication services in the areas they serve over 100 years ago. We are able to leverage our long-standing relationship with our local service customers by offering them a broad suite of telecommunications and information services, such as long distance, internet/broadband data access and, in some areas, video and security, thereby increasing customer loyalty and revenue per customer. Each RLEC qualifies as a rural telephone company under the Federal Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”). We are currently exempt from certain costly interconnection requirements imposed on larger incumbent local telephone companies by the Communications Act. Although this exemption helps us maintain a strong competitive position, we have direct competition in the majority of our RLEC markets, primarily where a cable provider also serves the same market. In addition, the leading wireless carriers have deployed their networks to serve our markets. 
 In Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, our facilities-based CLEC serves primarily business and enterprise customers, utilizing both owned and leased fiber as its backbone network. After two decades of operations, the CLEC serves over 2,400 business and enterprise customers. 
 Acquisitions have represented a significant part of our growth. From 1999 to 2003, we acquired four contiguous RLECs in north central Alabama. In 2004, we acquired an RLEC in central Missouri. In 2006, we acquired an RLEC adjacent to Bangor, Maine, and a CLEC serving the state of Maine. In 2008, we acquired RLECs adjacent to Portland, Maine, in western Massachusetts and southern West Virginia, as well as two CLECs serving customers in Maine and New Hampshire. In 2011, we acquired an RLEC in western Vermont. In 2014, we acquired the assets of Reliable Networks of Maine, LLC, a Portland, Maine-based provider of cloud hosting and managed services for companies who rely on mission-critical software applications. The acquisition expanded our CLEC service offerings to include multi-tenancy hosting of vendor-agnostic email, database, web and industry vertical software applications, as well as related professional engineering services (collectively, “managed services”).

 Local Services
We are the sole provider of wireline voice telephone services in three of the eleven RLEC territories we serve. In seven territories, the incumbent cable provider also offers local services in portions of these territories. In Missouri, a local electric co-operative also offers local services in a portion of our territory. Local services enable customers to originate and receive telephone calls. The amount that we can charge a customer for certain basic voice services in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Vermont and West Virginia is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission (the “APSC”), the Maine Public Utilities Commission (the “MPUC”), the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Cable (the “MDTC”), the Missouri Public Service Commission (the “MPSC”), the Vermont Public Utilities Commission (the “VPUC”) and the West Virginia Public Service Commission (the “WVPSC”), respectively. We also have authority to provide service in New Hampshire from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (the “NHPUC”). The regulatory involvement in pricing varies by state and by type of service. In recent years, state commissions have relaxed price regulation of most of our services. 
 Revenue derived from local services includes monthly recurring charges for voice lines providing local dial tone and calling features, including caller identification, call waiting, call forwarding and voicemail. We also receive revenue for providing long distance services to our customers and directory advertising. We provide local services on a retail basis to residential and business customers. With the high level of acceptance of local service bundles, a significant percentage of our customers receive a broad range of bundled services for a single, fixed monthly price. 
 We offer long distance telephone services to our RLEC local telephone customers. We provide long distance services on our own facilities or through services purchased from various network service providers. The majority of our RLEC voice customers also utilize our long distance services. Our long distance business is an integral part of the bundles of services we provide to our RLEC customers. 
 In Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, our CLEC provides communications services tailored to business and enterprise customers, including specialized data and voice network configurations, to support their unique business requirements. Our fiber network allows us to offer our customers affordable and reliable voice and data solutions to support their business requirements and applications. 
 Network Access
Network access revenue relates primarily to services provided by us to long distance carriers in connection with their use of our facilities to originate and terminate interstate and intrastate long distance, or toll, telephone calls. As toll calls are generally billed to the customer originating the call, network access charges are applied in order to compensate each telecommunications company providing services relating to the call. Network access charges apply to both interstate and intrastate calls. Until December 31, 2016, all eleven of our RLECs received Interstate Common Line Support (“ICLS”) and revenue from the Universal Service Fund (the “USF”), and three of our RLECs also received Universal Service Fund High Cost Loop (“USF HCL”) revenue. This revenue is included in our reported network access revenue. Beginning January 1, 2017,

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 ICLS and USF HCL funding was replaced by Alternative Connect America Model (“A-CAM”) funding for ten of our RLECs. Our Vermont RLEC, which did not qualify for A-CAM because it had already deployed fiber to parts of its network, continued to receive USF HCL, and a revised form of ICLS called Connect America Fund Broadband Loop Support (“CAF BLS”), through December 31, 2018. 
 In December 2018, the FCC issued an order which revised the A-CAM program (“A-CAM II Order”). A-CAM II changed the broadband buildout requirements from speeds of 10/1 to 25/3 Mbps, provided additional funding for the higher speeds and extended the time for completing the buildout by two years. Accordingly, existing Otelco A-CAM participants became eligible for additional funding and extended their buildout period by two years. In addition, our Vermont RLEC qualified for participation in A-CAM II and elected to give up its CAF BLS support in exchange for A-CAM II funding. The A-CAM II support was effective on January 1, 2019.
  Intrastate Access Charges.   We generate intrastate access revenue when a long distance call, involving a long distance carrier, is originated and terminated within the same state. The interexchange carrier pays us an intrastate access payment for either terminating or originating the call. We record the details of the call through our carrier access billing system. Our access charges for our intrastate access services were historically set by state regulatory commissions. The Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) issued its intercarrier compensation order in October 2011 (the “FCC ICC Order”). The FCC ICC Order preempted the state commissions’ authority to set terminating intrastate access service rates. The FCC required companies with terminating access rates higher than interstate rates to reduce their terminating intrastate access rates to a rate equal to interstate access service rates by July 1, 2013, and to move to a “bill and keep” arrangement by July 1, 2020, which will eliminate terminating access charges between carriers. The FCC ICC Order also created the Connect America Fund (the “CAF”) to offset the RLECs’ resulting loss in intrastate terminating access revenues, but limited the yearly amount recovered to 95% of the previous year’s revenue requirement. There is no recovery mechanism for the lost revenue in our CLEC. 
  Interstate Access Charges.   We generate interstate access revenue when a long distance call originates from an area in a state served by one of our local exchange carriers and terminates outside of that state, or vice versa. We bill interstate access charges in a manner similar to intrastate access charges. Our RLEC interstate access charges are regulated by the FCC through our participation in tariffs filed by John Staurulakis Inc. The FCC regulates the prices local exchange carriers charge for access services in two ways: price caps and rate-of-return. All of our RLECs are rate-of-return carriers for purposes of interstate network access regulation. Interstate access revenue for rate-of-return carriers for non-FCC ICC Order elements is based on an FCC regulated rate-of-return on investment and recovery of operating expenses and taxes, in each case solely to the extent related to interstate access. From 1990 through June 2016, the rate-of-return had been authorized up to 11.25%. In March 2016, the FCC reduced the authorized rate-of-return to 9.75% (effective July 1, 2021), using a transitional approach to reduce the impact of an immediate reduction. On July 1, 2016, the rate-of-return transition began with the authorized rate reduced to 11.0%, with further 25 basis points reductions each July 1 thereafter until the authorized rate reaches 9.75% on July 1, 2021. The FCC requires terminating interstate access rates to move to a “bill and keep” arrangement by July 1, 2020, which will eliminate access charges between carriers. Initial reductions in interstate access rates began July 1, 2012, with additional reductions on July 1 of each year through July 1, 2020. The CAF provides recovery of terminating interstate access revenues. This recovery is limited to 95% of the previous year’s revenue requirement and excludes CLECs. 
  Transition Service Fund Revenue.   Our four Alabama RLECs recover a portion of their costs through the Transition Service Fund (the “TSF”), which is administered by the APSC. All interexchange carriers originating calls in Alabama contribute to the TSF on a monthly basis, with the amount of each carrier’s contribution calculated based upon its relative originating minutes of use compared to the aggregate originating minutes of use for all telecommunication carriers participating in the TSF. The TSF reduces the vulnerability of our Alabama RLECs to a loss of access and interconnection revenue. TSF payments are received monthly. Negotiations to eliminate TSF payments in Alabama were completed in August 2015. TSF payments will be phased out over a five-year period that began in June 2016 and will end in June 2021. The reduction in the TSF was 5% in each of 2016 and 2017 and 10% in 2018 and will be 15% in each of 2019 and 2020.

  Maine Universal Service Fund.   One of our three Maine RLECs recovers a portion of its costs through the Maine Universal Service Fund (the MUSF”), which is administered by the MPUC. All local and interexchange carriers in Maine contribute to the MUSF on a monthly basis, with the amount of each carrier’s contribution calculated based upon a percentage of retail intrastate revenues. The MUSF was created to support RLEC universal service goals in response to legislative mandates to reduce intrastate access rates, expand local calling areas and cap local service rates. 
 Internet
We provide a variety of internet data services to our customers, including bulk broadband data to support large corporate enterprise users and digital high-speed data lines in varying capacity speeds for business and residential use. Digital high-speed data services are provided via fiber to the premise; fiber to the node; digital subscriber line (“DSL”); cable modems; and wireless broadband, depending upon the location in which the service is offered, and via dedicated fiber connectivity to larger business customers. With the expansion of our RLEC fiber network, the upgrade of our cable network to DODSIS 3.1 and the standardization on VDSL throughout our network, approximately 75% of the RLEC territory will be able to have from 50 mps to gigabit capability by the end of 2020. We charge our internet customers a flat rate for unlimited usage and a premium for higher speed internet services. We are able to provide digital internet data lines to virtually all of our RLEC customers and all of our CLEC customers. Under A-CAM, we have specific requirements to expand the availability of higher broadband speeds to our customers and expect to invest in our network to meet or exceed those requirements in the timeframes required by the FCC. 
 Transport Services
Our CLEC receives monthly recurring revenues for the rental of fiber to transport data and other telecommunication services in Maine and New Hampshire from businesses and telecommunication carriers over our fiber network. Large business, education and government customers in our RLEC are also served from our fiber-based network. 
 Video and Security
We provide cable television services, including high definition, digital video recording capability and pay- per-view programming, over networks with 750 MHz of transmission capacity or by Internet Protocol television (“IPTV”) in our Alabama service area. We offer digital signals, high-definition program content and digital video recording capability through both our traditional cable plant and IPTV. In 2020, our cable network will be upgraded to DOCSIS 3.1, enabling customers to have up to gigabit speed internet services. Our cable television packages offer up to 200 channels. We are a licensed installer of security equipment in Alabama. We offer wireless security systems in Alabama and Missouri and monthly monitoring of security systems through a third-party monitoring company. 
 Managed Services
We provide private/hybrid cloud hosting services, as well as consulting and professional IT engineering services, for mission-critical software applications used by small and mid-sized North American companies. Revenues are generated from monthly recurring hosting fees, commonly referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”), monthly maintenance fees, à la carte professional engineering services and pay-as-you-use Software as a Service (“SaaS”). Services are domiciled in two diverse Company-owned data centers. 
 Network Assets
Our telephone networks include carrier-grade advanced switching capabilities provided by both traditional digital and software-based switches; fiber rings and routers; and network software supporting specialized business applications, all of which meet industry standards for service integrity, redundancy, reliability and flexibility. Our networks enable us to provide traditional and Internet Protocol (“IP”), wireline telephone services and other calling features; long distance services; digital internet services through DSL, cable modems and dedicated circuits; and specialized customer specific applications.

 Sales, Marketing and Customer Service
In Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia, our RLECs and CLEC historically provided services under the brand names “OTT Communications” and “Reliable Networks.” However, beginning in 2018, all services were rebranded under the brand name “Otelco.” Our CLEC competes with the incumbent carriers throughout each state, as well as with other competitive communications providers, utilizing both an employee and agent sales force. Service configurations are tailored to meet specific customer requirements, utilizing customer designed voice and data telecommunications configurations. Increased service monitoring for business customers is provided through a state of the art network operations center and serves as a differentiator for our offers. We offer an IP-based Hosted Private Branch Exchange service (“HPBX”) that provides industry-leading capability for our customers, as well as cloud hosting and professional engineering services. 
 Our RLEC marketing approach emphasizes locally managed, customer-oriented sales, marketing and service. We believe that we are able to differentiate ourselves from any competition by providing a superior level of service in our territories. Each of our RLECs has a long history in the communities it serves, which has helped to enhance our reputation among local residents by fostering familiarity with our products and level of service. Our customer service representatives are local residents and often have a direct connection to their communities, which we believe further improves customer satisfaction. We also build upon our strong reputation by participating in local activities, such as local fundraising and charitable events for schools and community organizations and, in Alabama, by airing local interest programs on our local access community cable channels. 
 Part of our strategy is to increase customer loyalty and strengthen our brand name by deploying new technologies, adding fiber to our distribution network, and offering comprehensive bundling of services, including digital high-speed internet access, cable television, unlimited long distance and a full array of calling features. In addition, our ability to provide our customers with a single, unified bill for all of our RLEC and CLEC services is a competitive advantage and helps to enhance customer loyalty. 
 Competition
Local Services
We believe that many of the competitive threats to wireline telephone companies are not as significant in portions of our RLEC service areas as in more urban areas. The demographic characteristics of rural telecommunications markets generally require significant capital investment to offer competitive wireline telephone services with low potential revenues. However, our RLECs face wireline telephone competition in the majority of our markets from a cable company or electric co-operative offering telephone and data services. New market entrants, such as providers of satellite broadband, and indirect competition, such as providers of voice over IP (“VoIP”), have also gained greater acceptance over time. 
 We currently qualify for the federal rural exemption from certain interconnection obligations that support industry competition, including obligations to provide services for resale at discounted wholesale prices and to offer unbundled network elements. If the exemption were terminated by a state commission, then our RLECs could face additional competition. 
 In all of our markets, we face competition from wireless carriers. We have experienced a decrease in voice lines as a result of customers switching their residential wireline telephone service to a wireless service. A portion of the wireless technology threat to our business is reduced, due in part to the topography of some of our telephone territories, which can result in inconsistent wireless coverage in some areas. Nevertheless, as wireless carriers continue the deployment of newer technologies in our territories, we expect to experience increased competition from these carriers. 
 The long distance market remains competitive in all of our RLEC territories. We compete with wireless carriers and other service providers. However, we believe that our service bundling that includes long distance, our long-standing local presence in our territories and our ability to provide a single, unified bill for all of our services are competitive advantages. The majority of our customers have selected us for their long distance services as part of their overall package of services.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 In Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, we operate as a facilities-based CLEC in areas primarily served by Consolidated Communications (formerly FairPoint Communications) or Verizon. There are other competitors who serve these markets today as both facilities-based and resale carriers. Our focus has been on the small-to-medium size business customer with multiple locations and enterprise telecommunications requirements, where we offer a combination of knowledge, experience, competitive pricing and IP-based products to meet their specialized needs. 
 Internet
Competition in the provision of RLEC data lines and internet services currently comes from alternative digital high-speed internet service providers. Competitors vary on a market-to-market basis and include cable providers Charter Communications, Inc., under the Spectrum brand name (“Spectrum”), Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) and Co-Mo Electric Cooperative, Inc. in Missouri, we provide wireless high-speed data lines to over 2,000 subscribers outside of our rural telephone services territory. Our CLEC customers are provided a variety of data service options based on their individual requirements. 
 Transport Services
Other local telephone companies, long distance carriers, cable providers, utilities, governments and industry associations deploy and sell fiber capacity to users. Existing and newly deployed capacity could affect market pricing. Multi-year contracts generally protect existing relationships and provide revenue stability. The cost of and time required for deploying new fiber can be a deterrent to adding capacity. We have expanded our fiber networks in Maine and Alabama to reach additional locations and serve incremental customers. 
 Video and Security
We offer cable television services in our Alabama territory. Cable services are delivered through traditional cable technology and IPTV. Spectrum provides cable service, passing about 30% of our RLEC Alabama telephone subscribers and approximately 60% of our RLEC Maine telephone subscribers. In Massachusetts, Comcast provides cable service, passing more than 90% of our telephone subscribers. In West Virginia, Shentel provides cable service, passing more than 98% of our telephone subscribers. In addition, we compete against digital broadcast satellite providers including DISH Network and AT&T’s DirecTV in our Alabama territory. Our broadband subscribers also have access to “Over The Top” entertainment services offered by numerous providers, such as Netflix and Hulu, including local broadcast channels in Vermont. 
 Managed Services
The managed services and cloud hosting market has numerous competitors from very large multi-dimensional companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM, to divisions of large telecommunications firms, to small operations serving specific local markets or industries. Our managed services offerings are focused on small and mid-sized companies who have mission-critical software applications that also need operational and design support for their applications. 
 Information Technology and Support Systems
We have an integrated software system that functions as both an operational support and a customer care/billing system. The system includes automated provisioning and service activation, mechanized line records and trouble reporting. These services are provided through the use of licensed third-party software, which has been tailored for our use by the vendor. The system will include detailed network and premise maps for all RLEC territories by the end of 2020. 
 We have implemented all currently established safeguards to Customer Proprietary Network Information as established by the FCC for telecommunications providers, and we are compliant with the “red flag” provisions of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. 
 Environment
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws. The environmental compliance

 costs incurred by us to date have not been material, and we currently have no reason to believe that such costs will become material in the foreseeable future. 
 Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed 201 employees, 200 of which were full-time employees. None of our employees are members of, or are represented by, any labor union or other collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
 Item 1A.   Risk Factors
In evaluating our business, every investor should carefully consider the following risk factors. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following risks. Our business operations could also be affected by additional risk factors that apply generally to companies, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. 
 The Telecommunications Industry Experiences Continuous Competition.
The market for telecommunication services is highly competitive. Currently, we have competition in eight of our markets from cable providers and an electric co-operative. Certain competitors benefit from brand recognition, financial, personnel and marketing resources and access to capital that are significantly greater than ours, which may also be affected by further industry consolidation. In addition, our relative size and the distance between our regional businesses makes it more difficult for us to achieve scale economies and efficiencies than certain of our competitors, which puts us at a competitive disadvantage and may lead to customer attrition. We cannot predict the number of new competitors that will emerge, especially as a result of existing or new federal and state regulatory or legislative actions. Increased competition from existing and new entities could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. 
 In all of our markets, we face competition from wireless carriers. As wireless carriers continue to build out and enhance their voice and data networks and add products and services targeted to the fixed wireless market, we may experience increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. 
 The current and potential competitors in our RLEC territories include cable television companies; electric utilities; CLECs and other providers of telecommunications and data services, including internet and VoIP service providers; wireless carriers; satellite television companies; alternate access providers; and neighboring incumbent local exchange carriers. 
 In Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, our CLEC operations may encounter changes in the competitive landscape that would affect its continued ability to grow and/or retain customers, sustain current pricing plans and control the cost of access to incumbent carrier customers. Our CLEC leases a portion of its facilities, reducing its ability to adjust to price competition. A portion of these “last mile” facilities leased from the incumbent carrier can no longer be ordered for new customers and may become more expensive in February 2023, which would negatively impact our cost of service. 
 We provide our long distance services within our territories, primarily through bundling long distance with other local services and providing a single bill for these services. Carriers offering VoIP services continue to develop attractive new offerings. There can be no assurance that our local services revenue, including long distance services, will not decrease in the future due to competition and/or the introduction of new services by current and new competitors. 
 Changes in the Regulation of the Telecommunications Industry Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue or Cash Flow.
We operate in an industry that is regulated at the federal, state and local level. The majority of our revenue has historically been supported by and/or subject to some level of regulation. Certain federal and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 other things, federal and state universal service funds, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. The FCC ICC Order began significantly reducing access revenue received by us in July 2012. Subsequently, we accepted the FCC’s A-CAM offer for all of our eleven RLECs, which replaced USF HCL revenue for ten of those RLECs effective as of January 1, 2017, and one RLEC during 2019, requiring additional network capital expenditures. A-CAM support will decline over a twelve year period. In addition, there can be no assurances that recent FCC actions will not be changed in the future. Any such changes could adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. 
 If We Fail to Meet Our Broadband Deployment Obligations Under A-CAM, We May Lose All or Part of Our A-CAM Support.
On March 23, 2016, the FCC released an order, which adopted changes to the Universal Service programs, directed to preserve and advance voice and broadband service in areas served by rate-of-return carriers. The order provided qualifying rate-of-return carriers the option of receiving model-based support through A-CAM in lieu of legacy rate-of-return support through CAF BLS, formerly ICLS, and USF HCL. Ten of our RLECs qualified for A-CAM and elected to accept A-CAM support beginning in 2017. Our other RLEC became eligible for A-CAM in 2019 and elected to receive support beginning in January 2019. These elections are expected to provide A-CAM support through 2028. However, the A-CAM election includes specific broadband deployment obligations, including the number of locations to be capable of specific broadband speeds within certain eligible Census Blocks in our service areas. If we fail to meet these broadband deployment obligations, we may lose all or part of our A-CAM support, which would adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. 
 If We Continue to Lose Voice and Data Lines, Our Business and Results of Operations Will Likely Be Adversely Affected.
Our business generates revenue by delivering voice and data services. We have experienced net voice and data line loss in our markets due to wireless substitution, increased competition from organizations using different delivery technologies and the inability to offer increased data speeds for our customers driven by the nature of the Company’s primarily copper-based network. Without increased investment in fiber and other delivery technologies, we expect to continue to experience net voice and data line loss in our markets, which could impact our ability to fund continued investment in our network. 
 We Are Subject to Restrictive Debt Covenants That Limit Our Business Flexibility By Imposing Operating and Financial Restrictions on Our Operations.
Our credit facility contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, which may limit our ability to invest in new services or respond to competitive forces, including, without limitation, restrictions on our ability to: 
 •

 incur certain liens; 
 ​
 •

 incur additional indebtedness; 
 ​
 •

 wind up, liquidate, merge, or consolidate with any other person or transfer or dispose of certain properties or assets; 
 ​
 •

 change the nature of our business; 
 ​
 •

 make certain types of restricted payments, including dividends on our common stock, investments and acquisitions; 
 ​
 •

 enter into specified transactions with affiliates; and 
 ​
 •

 enter into sale and leaseback transactions. 
 ​
 Future debt obligations may impose similar or other restrictive covenants.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 Our credit facility also requires quarterly fixed principal payments and annual variable excess cash flow payments, which may limit cash available for our operations. In addition, our financial covenants may require the use of operating cash to pay outstanding debt and limit our ability to invest in our operations. 
 The interest rates of our term loans are set at a margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate.
LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Interest rates applicable to our term loans (including any incremental term loans incurred under the accordion feature) and the revolving loans (other than the swing line loans) under our credit facility are set at a margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate (which is defined as the higher of (1) LIBOR multiplied by the statutory reserve rate and (2) 0.0% per annum) or a base rate (which is defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum, (c) the adjusted LIBOR rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% per annum, and (d) 0.0% per annum), at our option. Interest rates applicable to the swing line loans under our credit facility are set at a margin over the above-mentioned base rate. 
 On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as a more robust reference rate alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. SOFR is calculated based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. In preparation for the potential phase out of LIBOR, we may need to renegotiate our financial obligations and derivative instruments that utilize LIBOR. However, these efforts may not be successful in mitigating the legal and financial risk from changing the reference rate in our legacy agreements. Furthermore, the discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely impact our ability to manage and hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates using derivative instruments. 
 We May Not Be Able to Integrate New Technologies and Provide New Services in a Cost-Efficient Manner.
The telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions, changes in pricing and evolving industry standards. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming to install and integrate into our network. Our financial condition or the terms and conditions included in our credit facility may limit our ability to make additional capital expenditures or procure additional products. In addition, a substantive investment by a competitor in a new technology could challenge our position in the marketplace, as the services offered by our competitor arising out of new technology may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate the revenue anticipated from such services. 
 Disruptions in Our Networks and Infrastructure May Cause Us to Lose Customers and Incur Additional Expenses.
To be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers with reliable and timely service over our networks. We face the following risks to our networks and infrastructure: 
 •

 our territories could have significant weather events which physically damage network infrastructure, potentially disrupting our ability to provide service and potentially encouraging our customers to find alternative service providers; 
 ​

 •

 our rural geography creates the risk of security breaches, break-ins and sabotage; 
 ​
 •

 much of our equipment has long service lives, which could increase the frequency of malfunction and outage; 
 ​
 •

 our equipment, access and network interface suppliers could experience outages, delivery limitations or labor issues which could impact our ability to provide services to our customers; 
 ​
 •

 power surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking and software or hardware defects that are beyond our control; and 
 ​
 •

 unusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers’ networks. 
 ​
 Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow. In addition, the APSC, MPUC, MDTC, MPSC, NHPUC, VPUC and/or WVPSC could require us to issue credits on customer bills for such service interruptions, further impacting revenue and cash flow. 
 Our Operating Activities Are Subject to Risks Caused by Misappropriation, Misuse, Leakage, Falsification and Accidental Release or Loss of Information Maintained in Our Information Technology Systems.
We operate critical infrastructure and our operating activities are subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification and accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data. These risks could result from cyber-attacks, which may be committed by our employees or external factors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, or by other means. Cyber-attacks against companies have increased in frequency, sophistication, scope and potential harm in recent years. Any preventive actions we have taken or may take to reduce the risks of cyber-attacks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a cyber-attack in the future, and our resources available to take preventive actions in the future may be limited. We could be exposed to significant costs if any of the above risks were to materialize, and any of the events described above could impair our operations, damage the reputation and credibility of us and our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. Costs related to these risks could include incentives offered to existing customers to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation, which may be protracted in nature. We could also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach. 
 Our Business is Geographically Concentrated and Dependent on Regional Economic Conditions.
Our business is conducted primarily in north central Alabama, Maine, New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, central Missouri, western Vermont and southern West Virginia and, accordingly, our business is dependent upon the general economic conditions of these regions. There can be no assurance that future economic conditions in these regions will not impact demand for our services or cause residents or businesses to relocate to other regions, which may adversely impact our business, revenue and cash flow. There can also be no assurance that these regions will respond to market and economic changes in a similar nature to urban markets or other regional areas. 
 Our Success Depends on a Small Number of Key Personnel.
Our success depends on the personal efforts of a small group of skilled employees and senior management. The rural nature of much of our service area provides for a smaller pool of skilled telephone employees and increases the challenge of hiring employees. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 Our Performance Is Subject to a Number of Economic and Non-Economic Factors That Are Beyond Our Control, Which We May Not Be Able to Predict Accurately.
There are factors that may be beyond our control that could affect our operations and business. Such factors include adverse changes in the conditions in the specific markets for our services, the conditions in the

 broader market for telecommunication services, natural disasters and health emergencies, including earthquakes, fires, power outages, typhoons, floods, pandemics or epidemics such as the coronavirus and manmade events such as civil unrest, labor disruption, international trade disputes, international conflicts, terrorism, wars and critical infrastructure attacks and the conditions in the domestic and global economies, generally. Any of these events, among others, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. For example, the coronavirus may impact the global economy or negatively affect various aspects of our business, including our workforce and demand for our services, which could impact our ability to deliver services to our customers and make it more difficult to meet our expectations and obligations. 
 Although our performance is affected by the general condition of the economy, not all of our services are affected equally. Voice revenue is generally linked to relatively consistent variables such as population changes, housing starts and general economic activity levels in the areas served. Data and cable television revenue is generally related to more variable factors, such as changing levels of discretionary spending on entertainment and the adoption of e-commerce and other online activities by our current or prospective customers. It is not possible for management to accurately predict all of these factors and the impact of such factors on our performance. 
 Changes in the competitive, technological and regulatory environments may also impact our ability to increase revenue and/or earnings from the provision of local wireline services. We may therefore have to place increased emphasis on developing and realizing revenue through the provision of new and enhanced services with higher growth potential. In such a case, there is a risk that these revenue sources, as well as our cost savings efforts through further efficiency gains, will not grow or develop at a fast enough pace to offset declines in local residential services. It is also possible that, as we invest in new technologies and services, demand for those new services may not develop. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our service offerings through the development of new services, and our efforts to do so may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 Failure to Receive Approved Levels of FCC Support Funding Would Adversely Affect Our Business, Revenue and Cash Flow.
Beginning January 1, 2017, A-CAM replaced USF HCL for two of our three RLECS that had previously received USF HCL support payments, and the third RLEC continued to receive USF HCL and CAF BLS support payments through December 2018. On January 1, 2019 it qualified for, and began receiving, A-CAM II funding. The A-CAM and A-CAM II support requires us to make additional capital investments to build out our network to support the delivery of higher broadband speeds. If our participating RLECs do not receive the approved level of A-CAM or A-CAM II support from the FCC for any reason, our business, revenue and cash flow would be negatively affected. 
 The outcome of any future FCC proceedings and other regulatory or legislative changes could affect the amount of support that we receive, and could have an adverse effect on our business, revenue and cash flow. If a wireless or other telecommunication carrier receives ETC status in our service areas or even outside of our service areas, the amount of support we receive from the USF HCL could decline under current rules, and under some proposed USF HCL rule changes, could be significantly reduced. 
 USAC serves as the administrative agent to collect data and distribute funds for USF and in 2006, it began conducting High Cost Beneficiary audits, designed to ensure compliance with FCC rules and program requirements and to assist in program compliance. USAC randomly selects RLECs to be audited each year and several of our RLECs have been selected for one of these audits each year. In December 2016, four of our RLECs were selected for a payment quality assurance audit, which has since been completed with no material findings. USAC has issued a no further action determination letter for three of these audits and the fourth audit revealed an overpayment due to us, which we refunded to USAC in July 2017. If USAC determines in any future audit that any of our data submissions were incorrect, we could be required to return funds to USAC for the period under review, which would negatively affect our business revenue and cash flow. 
 If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors’ views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain a

 “non-accelerated filer” for SEC reporting purposes, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various SEC reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which section would otherwise require us to annually obtain an audited opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could harm our operating results, investors’ views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
