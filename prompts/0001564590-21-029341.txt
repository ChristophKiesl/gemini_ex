ITEM 1. Business 
Overview 
 Eagle Materials Inc., through its subsidiaries, (the Company, which may be referred to as we, our, or us) is a leading supplier of heavy construction materials and light building materials in the United States. Our primary products are commodities that are essential in commercial and residential construction; public construction projects; and projects to build, expand, and repair roads and highways. Demand for our products is generally cyclical and seasonal, depending on economic and geographic conditions. We distribute our products across many United States markets, which provides us with regional economic diversification. 
 The Company was founded in 1963 as a building materials subsidiary of Centex Corporation (Centex). It operated as a public company under the name Centex Construction Products, Inc. from April 19, 1994 to January 30, 2004, at which time Centex completed a tax-free distribution of its shares to its shareholders, and the Company was renamed Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE: EXP).
 We benefit from several competitive strengths that have enabled us to deliver consistently strong operating results and profitable growth. These advantages include:
 Integrated plant network with a broad and diversified geographic reach - our plants are located near both raw material reserves and customers in high-growth U.S. markets, providing geographical diversification which reduces exposure to individual regional construction cycles; 
 Low-cost producer position - which we maintain through cycles;
 Production flexibility - enabling us to operate at high utilization levels generally, quickly position for downturns, and efficiently ramp up for demand rebounds;
 Substantial raw material reserves - between 25 to 50 years of primary raw-material reserves for each of our cement and wallboard facilities, providing certainty of supply and cost of our primary raw materials; and
 Proven management - our current management team has significant and valuable experience, with an average industry experience of more than 20 years, spanning several business cycles. Management’s conservative balance sheet strategy focuses on maintaining prudent levels of leverage and liquidity through the business cycle, to protect the balance sheet through downturns and enable us to take advantage of growth opportunities, whether organic or through acquisitions.
 These strengths form the basis of the Company’s strategy to protect and advance its competitive position and continue to deliver profitable growth.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 Decision to Remain a Combined Company
 In 2019, the Company conducted a strategic portfolio review and, upon completion of this review, announced plans to separate its Heavy Materials and Light Materials businesses into two independent, publicly traded corporations by means of a tax-free spin-off to Eagle shareholders. The planned separation was subsequently delayed due to, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting adverse market conditions.
 On May 19, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had decided not to pursue the proposed separation of the Heavy Materials and Light Materials business at this time. This decision was informed by a consideration of some of the key benefits associated with remaining a combined company. First, the Board of Directors viewed the size and financial strength of the combined Company, with its diversified asset base, geographic diversity and robust balance sheet, as having provided significant comfort, stability and value to our shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers during the time of the pandemic. Second, the Board concluded that, in light of the continued consolidation of the industries in which we participate and the Company’s continued rigorous examination of a number of strategic alternatives since the announcement of the proposed separation, a combined company with greater financial scale and flexibility would be better positioned to pursue key strategic growth options and enhance shareholder value. Third, since the announcement of the proposed separation, the Company has streamlined its business portfolio, including the divestiture of its Oil and Gas Proppants business and other non-core assets. The Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the merits of a separation on a periodic basis, as part of its consideration of strategic alternatives and opportunities to create long-term shareholder value.
 Strategy
 We rigorously pursue four overarching strategic objectives that consistently differentiate us from our competitors and contribute to our margin performance and growth: being a low-cost producer in all our markets, maintaining a decentralized operating structure, operating solely in the United States in regionally diverse and attractive markets, and achieving profitable growth through both strategic acquisitions and the organic development of our asset network. 
 Continuously innovate to advance our low-cost producer position
 Our goal and the bedrock of our strategy is to be a low-cost producer in each of the markets in which we compete. We have right-sized capacity to service the markets we cover, and we focus diligently on reducing costs and making our operations more efficient to manage free cash flow though the economic cycle. Maintaining our low-cost position provides meaningful competitive, financial, and environmental benefits. The products we make are basic necessities and competition is often based largely on price, with consistent quality and customer service also being important considerations. Thus, being a low-cost producer is a competitive advantage and can lead to higher margins, better returns and stronger free cash flow generation. Being a low-cost producer is not only key to our commercial success, it also fully aligns with and advances our commitment to sustainable environmental practices. To maintain our low-cost producer position, we are always innovating our production processes with the aim of using fewer resources to make the same products. We regularly invest in technologies at our facilities to control emissions and to modify the fuels that we burn.

Maintain a decentralized operating structure
 The Company operates through a decentralized structure: operations are managed separately, and products are branded and marketed by our individual companies. This regional-market strategy provides several benefits, including increased familiarity with our customers, higher brand recognition, and lower transportation costs, which is a meaningful advantage in the construction materials industry. We view our cement plant system and our wallboard plant system as discrete integrated networks, allowing us to ship products and minimize freight costs. The impact of regional construction cycles on our businesses is mitigated to some degree by our geographic diversification and integrated network of plants.
 Operate in regionally diverse and attractive markets
 Demand for our products depends on construction activity which tends to correlate with population growth. While the Company’s markets include most of the United States, approximately 70% of our total revenue is generated in ten states: Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas. Population growth, which is a major driver of construction products and building materials demand, is expected to grow approximately 17% between the 2010 census and 2040 for these ten states, compared with 14% population growth for the United States as a whole, according to the latest update in December 2019 by Moody’s Analytics. In our Light Materials sector, we have located operations primarily in the southern part of the United States, known as the Sun Belt. According to the same study, population in the Sun Belt is expected to grow by approximately 26% between the 2010 census and 2040.
 Achieve profitable growth through acquisition and organic development
 We seek to grow the Company through acquisitions and the organic development of our asset network. Since 2012, we have expanded the Heavy Materials sector principally through acquisitions, with total investments of approximately $2.0 billion, including our most recent purchase of Kosmos Cement Company in March 2020. These investments have more than doubled our U.S. cement capacity, making us the largest independent U.S. cement producer. 
 These acquisitions have expanded our geographic footprint so that we now have a contiguous, integrated cement system from California to western Pennsylvania and south to Texas. We have completed additional bolt-on acquisitions, which also contribute to our expanded geographic footprint. 
 The Company will continue to proactively pursue acquisition opportunities. Our free cash flow and balance sheet strength enable us to consider acquisitions and organic growth opportunities that align with our return on investment profitability objectives. 
 Capital Allocation Priorities
 Our capital allocation priorities are intended to enhance shareholder value and are as follows: 1. Growth investments that meet our financial return standards and are consistent with our strategic focus; 2. Operating capital investments to maintain and strengthen our low-cost producer positions; and 3. Return of excess cash to shareholders, primarily through our share repurchase program. Since becoming a public company in 1994, our share count is down approximately 40% and we have returned approximately $2.1 billion to our shareholders, through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.

FISCAL 2021 EVENTS
 Financial Highlights
 Fiscal 2021 was a strong year for the Company, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID related business shutdowns. The following are some of the Company’s highlights for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020:

• | Record Revenue of $1,622.6 million, up 16%. Organic revenue (does not include effect of the acquisitions and dispositions discussed below) up 5%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Net Income from Continuing Operations increased 45% to $334.2 million.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cement and Gypsum Wallboard Sales Volume increased 26% and 6%, respectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cash flows from operations increased by 61% to $643.1 million, enabling us to repay $560.0 million of debt during the year and increase our cash position.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company also completed the integration of Kosmos Cement Company and divested certain non-core businesses during the year, as described below.
 Integration of Kosmos Cement Company
 On March 6, 2020, we acquired the assets of Kosmos Cement Company (Kosmos), a joint venture between CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. and Buzzi Unicem S.p.A. for approximately $669 million. The acquisition included a (i) cement plant located in Louisville, Kentucky; (ii) a limestone quarry located in Battletown, Kentucky; (iii) cement distribution terminals located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Cincinnati, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Charleston, West Virginia; Ceredo, West Virginia; Mt. Vernon, Indiana; and Lexington, Kentucky; and (iv) certain other properties and assets used by Kosmos in connection with the foregoing (collectively, the Kosmos Business). The integration of Kosmos into our cement business was largely completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 
 See Footnote (B) to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the acquisition of Kosmos. 
 Divestitures
 On April 17, 2020, we sold our Western Aggregates and Mathews Readymix operations for $93.5 million to Teichert, Inc., a California-based construction company. These operations were included in our Concrete and Aggregates segment, and were considered non-core assets as they did not provide essential support to our primary cement plant network. 
 On May 30, 2019, we announced we were actively pursuing alternatives for our Oil and Gas Proppants business. On September 18, 2020, we sold this business to Smart Sand, Inc. for approximately $2.0 million, which was paid in Smart Sand common stock. The sale excluded certain assets, namely real property and equipment in south Texas, real property in Illinois, and certain other assets. After giving effect to the sale to Smart Sand, Inc., we are no longer engaged in the business of producing and selling sand used in hydraulic fracturing.
 See Footnote (C) to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the above divestitures.

HUMAN CAPITAL
 As of March 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 2,200 employees, of which approximately 650 are salaried and approximately 1,550 are hourly. Approximately 700 of the hourly employees are employed under collective bargaining agreements and various supplemental agreements with local unions.
 Recruiting, developing, and retaining qualified employees is essential to implement our strategy and maintain our low-cost position. All of our employees are provided with the training necessary to safely and effectively perform their responsibilities. The health and safety of our employees is the highest priority of management. In all our businesses we have implemented initiatives to improve safety in the workplace. We hold an annual safety conference in the fall of each year, during which we discuss a variety of topics, including training programs; sharing of best practices; and maintaining focus on leading indicators, such as near-miss reporting, root cause analysis of all lost-time injuries, and sharing and discussing incidents that occurred during the past year. We also invite outside parties to assist in identifying potential safety trends and ways to mitigate identified risks. Management reviews a variety of safety metrics, including leading and lagging indicators, and updates are provided to corporate management by the business units monthly throughout the year. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic created a unique challenge to our business and industry.  We were designated an essential business in most of our locations, enabling us to continue production throughout the pandemic. We implemented enhanced health and safety protocols to safeguard our employees, as well as our customers and suppliers, both at our plants and third-party sites. Some of these health and safety protocols consisted of restricting access to our facilities to employees only, limiting travel between facilities by Company personnel to essential travel only, dividing the workforce at each location to ensure that any outbreak would not affect the entire workforce, staggering the timing of annual outages to ensure that only two cement plants were down at any one time, providing employees with up-to-date information about COVID-19 hot spots; and requiring self-quarantine for any employees who were possibly exposed to COVID-19. Despite the declining infection rates, we are continuing to focus on limiting possible future cases.
 Industry Segment Information
 Our business is organized into two sectors: Heavy Materials, which includes the Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments; and Light Materials, which includes the Gypsum Wallboard and Recycled Paperboard segments. The primary end market for our Cement segment is infrastructure, while the primary end market for our Concrete and Aggregates segment is infrastructure, and both residential and commercial construction. The primary end market for our Gypsum Wallboard and Recycled Paperboard segments is residential construction.
 For information about the financial results of our business segments, including revenue, average net sales prices, sales volume and operating earnings, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Heavy Materials
 Our Heavy Materials sector provides cement and concrete and aggregates for use in infrastructure, commercial, and residential construction. This sector comprises the Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments. Demand has been strong for these construction products over the last several years. Cement consumption in the United States, as estimated by the Portland Cement Association (PCA), was approximately 112.1 million short tons in calendar 2020, compared with 109.8 million short tons in calendar 2019, and imported cement consumption was 17% of total sales in calendar 2020 compared with 16% in calendar 2019.
 Cement
 Cement is the basic binding agent for concrete, a primary construction material. The principal sources of demand for cement are public infrastructure, commercial construction, and residential construction, with public infrastructure accounting for nearly 50% of cement demand. Because of its low-value-to-weight ratio, the relative cost of transporting cement on land is high and limits the geographic area in which each producer can market its products profitably. Management believes shipments by truck are generally limited to a 150-mile radius from each plant up to 300 miles by rail, and further by barge. Therefore, the U.S. cement industry comprises numerous regional markets rather than a single national market. Cement consumption is affected by the time of year and prevalent weather conditions. Cement sales are generally greatest from spring through the middle of autumn. 
 The manufacturing process for portland cement primarily involves four main steps, as shown in the graphic below:


We also produce and market other cementitious products, including slag cement and fly ash. Slag granules are obtained from a steel company and ground in our grinding facility. Slag is used in concrete mix designs to improve the durability of concrete and reduce future maintenance costs. Fly ash is a by-product of a coal-fired power plant and acts as an extender of cement in concrete.
 Cement Plants
 We operate eight modern cement plants (one of which is operated through a joint venture), and one slag grinding facility. Our clinker capacity is approximately 6.7 million tons, which is approximately 6% of total U.S. clinker capacity (clinker is the intermediary product before it is ground into cement powder). All of our cement plants use dry-process technology, and approximately 80% of our clinker capacity is produced from preheater or preheater/pre-calciner kilns, which are generally more energy-efficient kiln types. In addition to production facilities, we also operate 29 cement storage and distribution terminals. 
 Our cement companies focus on the U.S. heartland and operate as an integrated network selling product mainly in Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas. Our joint venture includes a minority interest in an import terminal in Houston, Texas, from which we can purchase up to 495,000 short tons annually. Our slag facility is located near Chicago, Illinois and has 500,000 tons annual grinding capacity.

 All of our cement subsidiaries are wholly owned except the Buda, Texas plant (the Joint Venture), which is owned by Texas Lehigh Cement Company LP, a limited partnership joint venture owned 50% by us, and 50% by Lehigh Cement Company LLC, a subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement AG. 
 Our cement production, including our 50% share of the cement Joint Venture production, totaled 6.9 million short tons in fiscal 2021 and 5.4 million short tons in fiscal 2020. Total net cement sales, including our 50% share of cement sales from the Joint Venture, were 7.5 million and 5.9 million short tons in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. The increases in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 are due primarily to the Kosmos Acquisition in March 2020.
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution
 The principal sources of demand for cement and slag are public infrastructure, private non-residential construction, and residential construction, with public infrastructure comprising nearly 50% of total demand. Cement consumption in the U.S. increased approximately 2% during calendar 2020 from calendar 2019, and the PCA forecasts cement consumption will increase another approximately 2% in calendar 2021. Demand for cement is seasonal, particularly in northern states where inclement winter weather often affects construction activity. Cement sales are generally greatest from spring through the middle of autumn. Demand for slag has increased as the availability of fly ash has decreased due to the reduction in the use of coal to generate power.

Because of cement’s low value-to-weight ratio, the relative cost of transporting cement on land is high and limits the geographic area in which each company can market its products profitably. The low value-to-weight ratio generally limits shipments by truck to a 150-mile radius from each plant, up to 300 miles by rail, and further by barge. Consequently, the U.S. cement industry is made up of regional markets rather than a single national selling market. No single cement company has a distribution of plants extensive enough to serve all geographic areas, so profitability is sensitive to shifts in the balance between regional supply and demand.
 Environmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the U.S. cement industry to expand existing facilities and to build new cement facilities. Although we cannot predict which policies will be adopted in the future by federal, state, and local governmental bodies, we anticipate that future restrictions will likely continue to make zoning and permitting of new capacity additions difficult. This could potentially enhance the value of our existing facilities. Furthermore, cost-efficient alternatives to cement are currently limited, and the availability of some alternatives is diminishing. For example, the availability of fly ash, a cement replacement, has decreased because of the retirement of coal fired power plants and the conversion of power plants from coal to natural gas and other forms of energy.
 The difficulty in adding cement capacity, coupled with limited alternatives, leads to high U.S. cement manufacturing utilization rates, as well as the need for imported cement when demand levels are high.  Cement imports into the U.S. occur mostly to supplement domestic cement production or to supply a particular region. Cement is typically imported into deep water ports along the coast or on the Great Lakes, or transported on the Mississippi River system near major population centers. Our position in the U.S. heartland, away from most import terminals, insulates us from coastal imports, given the expense of transporting cement from deep water ports into the heartland regions. This geographic position further enhances the value of our plant network.   
 The PCA estimates that imports represented approximately 17% of cement used in the U.S. during calendar 2020, compared with 16% in calendar 2019. The PCA also estimates that imports will increase to approximately 18% of calendar 2021 consumption. Based on the normal distribution of cement into the market, we believe that no less than approximately 5% to 10% of the total consumption will consistently be served by imported cement.

The following table sets forth information regarding the geographic areas served by each of our cement and slag plants and the location of our distribution terminals in each area. We have 29 cement storage and distribution terminals that are strategically located to extend the sales areas of our plants.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | We acquired this terminal on September 2, 2020.
----+------------------------------------------------


(3) | This facility is being leased.
----+-------------------------------

 We are leasing the terminal in Fairfield, Ohio under an initial term of four years, with two one-year options, which expire in fiscal 2025. The terminal in Lexington, Kentucky is being leased under an initial term of five years and will be up for renewal in fiscal 2024. The terminal in Mt. Vernon, Indiana is leased through fiscal 2031, and contains options that will allow the renewal of this lease for an additional twenty years.
 Cement and slag are distributed directly to our customers mostly through customer pickups, and also by common carriers from our plants or distribution terminals. We transport cement, slag, and fly ash by truck, barge, and rail to our storage and distribution terminals. 
 No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our Cement segment sales during fiscal 2021. We do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts or have a significant level of order backlog. 
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 
 The principal raw material used in the production of portland cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone. Limestone is obtained mainly through mining and extraction operations conducted at mines and quarries that we own or lease, and that are located in close proximity to our plants. We believe the estimated recoverable limestone reserves we own or lease will permit each of our plants to operate at our present production capacity for at least 25 years. We are actively seeking additional limestone reserves close to our plants and believe we will be able to acquire more reserves in the future. Other raw materials used in substantially smaller quantities than limestone are sand, clay, iron ore, and gypsum. These 
 

9


materials are readily available and can be obtained either from Company-owned or leased reserves, or can be purchased from outside suppliers. 
 We utilize coal, petroleum coke, natural gas, and alternative fuels to fuel our cement plants. The cost of fuel and power increased in fiscal 2021, compared with fiscal 2020, due to higher natural gas prices during the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect the cost of fuel to remain fairly consistent in fiscal 2022. In keeping with our commitment to sustainability and cost management, we continue to expand the use of alternative fuels at our cement facilities.
 We have a long-term agreement with a steel manufacturer to supply granules necessary for grinding slag. This agreement requires us to purchase up to 550,000 tons of granules, which meet certain specifications, made available by the steel manufacturer each year. Electric power is also a major cost component in the manufacturing process for both cement and slag, and we have sought to diminish overall power costs by adopting interruptible power supply agreements at certain locations. These agreements may expose us to some production interruptions during periods of power curtailment. Historically, we have not had many production interruptions under these agreements.
 Environmental Matters
 Our cement operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety, and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws) impose environmental-permitting requirements and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated when conducting particular operations. Some laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (and analogous state laws) impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Other laws require us to reclaim certain land upon completion of extraction and mining operations in our quarries. We believe that we have obtained all the material environmental permits that are necessary to conduct our operations. We further believe that we are conducting our operations in substantial compliance with these permits. In addition, none of our manufacturing sites is listed as a CERCLA Superfund site. 
 The following environmental issues involving the cement manufacturing industry deserve special mention. 
 Cement Kiln Dust – Because much of CKD is unreacted raw materials, it is often returned to the production process. Substantially all CKD produced in connection with our ongoing operations is recycled, and therefore such CKD is not viewed as a waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). However, CKD was historically collected and stored on-site at our Illinois, Nevada, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wyoming cement plants and at a former plant site in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is no longer producing cement. Currently, CKD waste is generally excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under the federal regulations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been evaluating the regulatory status of CKD under the RCRA since 2002, and thus far has not changed its approach. If either the EPA or the states decide to reclassify or impose new management standards on this CKD at some point in the future, we could incur additional costs to comply with those requirements with respect to our historically collected CKD. CKD that comes in contact with water might produce a leachate with an alkalinity high enough to be classified as hazardous and might also leach certain hazardous trace metals therein.  
 Potential Greenhouse Gas Regulation – The potential regulation of our emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide, could affect our cement operations because (1) the cement manufacturing process requires the combustion of large amounts of fuel to generate very high kiln temperatures; and (2) the production of carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the calcination process, whereby 
 

10


carbon dioxide is removed from calcium carbonate to produce calcium oxide. Curbing GHG emissions is a clear priority for the newly elected President Biden. Further, several states have individually implemented or are presently considering measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG inventories or registries, or regional GHG cap and trade programs. It is not possible at this time to predict how any future legislation that may be enacted or final EPA regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business. However, any imposition of raw materials or production limitations, fuel-use or carbon taxes, or emission limitations or reductions could have a significant impact on the cement manufacturing industry and a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.
 Solid Waste Incineration Regulations – The EPA has promulgated revised regulations for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) units, pursuant to Section 129 of the CAA. The EPA has approved several states’ implementation plans under this rule, including plans submitted by Colorado and Oklahoma, and has proposed a federal plan that would apply in states that have not submitted and received approval for a state plan has. Compared to the PC NESHAP, the CISWI regulations contain requirements across a broader range of pollutants, and the requirement for dioxin/furans for existing and new sources is somewhat more stringent.
 Air Quality Standards for Ozone – The EPA is engaged in an ongoing review and implementation of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. Nonattainment designations in or surrounding our areas of operations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. The CAA requires the EPA to review, and if necessary, revise the NAAQS every five years. Most recently, in December 2020, the Trump Administration announced its decision to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS set by the Obama Administration without change. This December 2020 final action, however, is subject to legal challenge and is currently being reviewed by the EPA pursuant to President Biden’s executive order directing federal agencies to review certain environmental actions taken by the Trump Administration.
 We believe that our current procedures and practices in our operations, including those for handling and managing hazardous materials, are consistent with industry standards and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, because of the complexity of our operations and the environmental laws to which we are subject, there can be no assurance that past or future operations will not result in violations, remediation costs, or other liabilities or claims. Moreover, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted or adopted in the future or how such future environmental laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent environmental laws, or stricter interpretation of existing environmental laws, could necessitate significant capital outlays.
 In fiscal 2021, we had $2.4 million of capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our cement operations. We anticipate spending $2.9 million during fiscal 2022.

Concrete and Aggregates 
 Readymix concrete is a versatile, low-cost building material used in almost all construction. The production of readymix concrete involves mixing cement, sand, gravel or crushed stone, and water to form concrete, which is then sold and distributed to numerous construction contractors. Concrete is produced in batch plants and transported to customers’ job sites in mixer trucks. 
 The aggregates business consists of mining, extracting, producing, and selling crushed stone, sand, and gravel. Construction aggregates of suitable characteristics are employed in virtually all types of construction, including the production of readymix concrete, flexible base, and asphaltic mixes used in highway construction and maintenance. 
 On April 17, 2020, we sold Western Aggregates LLC and Mathews Readymix LLC, our readymix and aggregates companies in northern California for approximately $93.5 million. See Footnote (C) to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the sale. 
 Concrete and Aggregates Plants
 We produce and distribute readymix concrete from company-owned sites in Central Texas; the greater Kansas City area; and northern Nevada. The following table sets forth information regarding these operations:

Location | Number of Plants | | Number of Trucks
-----------------+------------------+----+-----------------
Central Texas | | 9 | | 82 
Kansas City Area | | 9 | | 82 
Northern Nevada | | 8 | | 56 
Total | | 26 | | 220

 We conduct aggregate operations near our concrete facilities. Aggregates are obtained principally by mining and extracting from quarries owned or leased by the Company. The following table sets forth certain information regarding these aggregate facilities: 
 
 
Location | Types of Aggregates | Estimated Annual Production Capacity (Thousand tons) | | Owned or Leased | | Estimated Minimum Reserves (Thousand Tons) (1) | | Estimated Minimum Reserves (Years) | Fiscal 2021 Tons Mined (Thousand Tons) |

 Our total net aggregates sales were 2.0 million tons in fiscal 2021 and 3.3 million tons in fiscal 2020. Total aggregates production was 2.5 million tons in fiscal 2021 and 4.1 million tons in fiscal 2020. The decline in both aggregates sales and aggregates production in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the sale of our northern California aggregates business in April 2020. Excluding Western Aggregates, our aggregates sales were 1.9 million tons in fiscal 2021 and 1.7 million tons in fiscal 2020. A portion of our total aggregates production is used internally by our readymix concrete operations in Texas and northern Nevada.

Demand, Sales, and Distribution 
 Demand for readymix concrete and aggregates largely depends on local levels of construction activity. Construction activity is also subject to weather conditions, the availability of financing at reasonable rates, and overall fluctuations in local economies, and therefore tends to be cyclical. We sell readymix concrete to numerous contractors and other customers in each plant’s marketing area. Our batch plants in Central Texas, the greater Kansas City area, and northern Nevada are strategically located to serve each marketing area. Concrete is delivered from the batch plants primarily by company-owned trucks. We sell aggregates to building contractors and other customers engaged in a wide variety of construction activities. Aggregates are delivered from our plants by common carriers and customer pickup. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2021 segment revenue. 
 The concrete and aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with numerous participants operating in each local area. Because the cost of transporting concrete and aggregates is very high relative to product values, producers of concrete and aggregates typically can profitably sell their products only in areas within 50 miles of their production facilities. Barriers to entry in each industry are low, except with respect to environmental permitting requirements for new aggregates production facilities and zoning of land to permit mining and extraction of aggregates. 
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies
 We obtain cement and aggregates for our concrete businesses from related companies, including our Joint Venture, as outlined below:
 
 
 | Percentage of Internally Supplied | 
-----------------+-----------------------------------+----
Location | Cement | | | Aggregates
Central Texas | | — | | | 45 | %
Kansas City Area | | 100 | % | | — | 
Northern Nevada | | 100 | % | | 95 | %

 We obtain the balance of our cement and aggregates requirements from multiple outside sources in each of these areas. 
 We mine and extract limestone, sand, and gravel, the principal raw materials used in the production of aggregates, from quarries owned or leased by us and located near our plants. On average, our aggregate reserves exceed 25 years based on normalized production levels and in many cases, much greater. 
 Environmental Matters 
 The concrete and aggregates industry is subject to environmental regulations similar to those governing our Cement operations. (See pages 10-11).
 In fiscal 2021, we had $0.2 million of capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our Concrete and Aggregates operations. We anticipate spending $0.5 million during fiscal 2022.

Light Materials
 Our Light Materials sector is comprised of the Gypsum Wallboard segment, which produces gypsum wallboard used in residential and commercial buildings, and the Recycled Paperboard segment, which produces paper primarily used in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard. Operations in this sector are concentrated in the Sun Belt of the United States, where the population is projected to grow approximately 26% between 2010 and 2040, according to the latest update in December 2019 by Moody’s Analytics. Population growth is a key long-term driver of demand for gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard. 
Gypsum Wallboard
 
Gypsum wallboard is used to finish the interior walls and ceilings in residential, commercial, and industrial structures. Our gypsum wallboard products are marketed under the name American Gypsum. 
 The gypsum wallboard manufacturing process involves four main steps, as shown in the graphic below:
 

Gypsum Wallboard Plants
 We own and operate five gypsum wallboard plants, outlined in the table below. We anticipate running all of our facilities at the level required to meet customer demand, up to maximum capacity. Our gypsum wallboard is distributed in the geographic markets nearest to our production facilities.

 Our Gypsum Wallboard production totaled 2,907 MMSF in fiscal 2021 and 2,706 MMSF in fiscal 2020. Total Gypsum Wallboard sales were 2,857 MMSF in fiscal 2021 and 2,694 MMSF in fiscal 2020.
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution
 The principal sources of demand for gypsum wallboard are (i) residential construction, (ii) repair and remodeling, (iii) non-residential construction, and (iv) other markets such as manufactured housing. According to the Gypsum Association, industry shipments of gypsum wallboard were approximately 26.2 billion square feet in calendar 2020, compared to 25.9 billion square feet in calendar 2019. We estimate that residential and repair and remodel construction accounted for more than 80% of calendar 2020 industry sales. 
 Demand for gypsum wallboard remains highly cyclical and closely follows construction industry cycles, particularly housing construction. Demand for wallboard can be seasonal and is generally highest from spring through the middle of autumn. 
 We sell Gypsum Wallboard to numerous building-materials dealers, gypsum wallboard specialty distributors, lumber yards, home-center chains, and other customers located throughout the United States, with the exception of the Northeast. Gypsum wallboard is sold on a delivered basis, mostly by truck. We generally use third-party common carriers for deliveries. Three customers accounted for approximately 35% of our Gypsum Wallboard segment sales during fiscal 2021. 
 Although gypsum wallboard is distributed principally in local areas, certain industry producers (including the Company) have the ability to ship gypsum wallboard by rail outside their usual regional distribution areas to regions where demand is strong. Our rail distribution capabilities permit us to service customers in markets on both the east and west coasts, except for the Northeast. Less than 10% of our Wallboard volume sold during fiscal 2021 was delivered via rail.
 There are currently six manufacturers of gypsum wallboard in the U.S., operating a total of 60 plants with a total of 71 lines, per the Gypsum Association. We estimate that the four largest producers ‒ Knauf, National Gypsum Company, Certainteed, and Koch Industries ‒ account for approximately 85% of gypsum wallboard sales in the U.S. Total wallboard-rated production capacity in the United States is currently estimated by the Gypsum Association at approximately 32.7 billion square feet per year.

Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies
 We mine and extract natural gypsum, the principal raw material used in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard, from quarries owned, leased, or subject to mining claims owned by the Company and located near our plants. Certain of our New Mexico reserves are under lease with the Pueblo of Zia. Gypsum ore reserves at the Gypsum, Colorado plant are contained within a total of 115 placer claims encompassing 2,300 acres. Included in this are 94 unpatented mining claims, where mineral rights can be developed upon completion of permitting requirements. We are currently in the twelfth year of a 60-year supply agreement (original 20-year term with two 20-year extension options) with a public utility in South Carolina for synthetic gypsum, which we use at our Georgetown, South Carolina plant. If the utility is unable to generate the agreed-upon amount of gypsum, it is responsible for providing gypsum from a third party to fulfill its obligations. 
 Through our modern low-cost paperboard mill, we manufacture sufficient quantities of paper necessary for our gypsum wallboard production. Paper is a significant cost component in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard, currently representing approximately one-third of our production cost. Paper costs are anticipated to increase in fiscal 2022, which is expected to increase our manufacturing cost. See Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies in the Recycled Paperboard section for more discussion. 
 Our gypsum wallboard manufacturing operations use natural gas and electrical power. A significant portion of the Company’s natural gas requirements for our gypsum wallboard plants are currently provided by three gas producers under gas-supply agreements expiring in October 2021 for Colorado, and October 2022 for South Carolina and Oklahoma. If the agreements are not renewed, we anticipate being able to obtain our gas supplies from other suppliers at competitive prices. Electrical power is supplied to our New Mexico plants at standard industrial rates by a local utility. For our Albuquerque plant, we have an interruptible power supply agreement, which may expose it to some production interruptions during periods of power curtailment. Power for our Gypsum, Colorado facility is generated at the facility by a cogeneration power plant that we own and operate. Currently, the cogeneration power facility supplies power and waste hot gases for drying to the gypsum wallboard plant. We do not sell any power to third parties. Natural gas costs represented less than 10% of our production costs in fiscal 2021.
 Environmental Matters
 The gypsum wallboard industry is subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety, and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws), impose environmental permitting requirements and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated when conducting particular operations. Some laws, such as CERCLA (and analogous state laws), impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Other laws require us to reclaim certain land upon completion of extraction and mining operations in our quarries. None of our gypsum wallboard operations is the subject of any local, state, or federal environmental proceedings. We do not, and have not, used asbestos in any of our gypsum wallboard products. 
 On April 17, 2015, the EPA published its final rule addressing the storage, reuse, and disposal of coal combustion products, which include fly ash and flue gas desulfurization gypsum (synthetic gypsum). We use synthetic gypsum in wallboard manufactured at our Georgetown, South Carolina plant. The rule, which applies only to electric utilities and independent power producers, establishes standards for the management of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, (RCRA), which is the Subtitle that regulates non-hazardous wastes. The rule imposes requirements addressing CCR surface impoundments and landfills, including location restrictions, design, 
 

16


and operating specifications; groundwater monitoring requirements; corrective action requirements; recordkeeping and reporting obligations; and closure requirements. Beneficial encapsulated uses of CCRs, including synthetic gypsum, are exempt from regulation. The rule became effective on October 19, 2015. Given the EPA’s decision to continue to allow CCR to be used in synthetic gypsum and to regulate CCR under the non-hazardous waste sections of RCRA, we do not expect the rule to materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although the EPA proposed revisions to the final CCR rule in 2018, 2019, and 2020, material effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations are unlikely because none of these proposed rules currently seek to overturn the management of CCR as non-hazardous waste or the regulatory exemption for beneficial encapsulated use of CCR.
 As discussed in greater detail in the “Environmental Matters” section for Cement, the EPA in October 2015 strengthened the NAAQS for ozone by lowering the primary and secondary standards from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. The EPA completed its attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised standards for all areas of the United States in July 2018. In December 2020, the Trump Administration announced its decision to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without change. This December 2020 final action, however, is subject to legal challenge and is currently being reviewed by the EPA pursuant to President Biden’s executive order directing federal agencies to review certain environmental actions taken by the Trump Administration. The EPA has not announced whether it plans to uphold or revise the 2020 ozone NAAQS. Consequently, if areas in or surrounding our operations obtain nonattainment designations, or if EPA chooses to revise and lower the current ozone NAAQS, our consolidated financial results may be materially impacted.
 Our gypsum wallboard manufacturing process combusts natural gas. It is possible that GHG emissions from our manufacturing could become subject to regulation under the CAA as the EPA begins issuing new regulations to achieve President Biden’s GHG emission reduction goals. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see the “Environmental Matters” section of our Cement business description on pages 10-11.
 Although our Gypsum Wallboard operations could be adversely affected by federal, regional, or state climate change initiatives, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business. However, any imposition of raw materials or production limitations, fuel-use or carbon taxes, or emission limitations or reductions could have a significant impact on the gypsum wallboard manufacturing industry and a material adverse effect on the financial results of our operations.
 There were $0.2 million of capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our Gypsum Wallboard operations during fiscal 2021. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 million related to our Gypsum Wallboard operations during fiscal 2022. 
 Recycled Paperboard 
 Our Recycled Paperboard manufacturing operation, which we refer to as Republic Paperboard Company, is located in Lawton, Oklahoma and has a technologically advanced paper machine designed primarily for gypsum liner production utilizing 100% recycled paper. The paper’s uniform cross-directional strength and finish characteristics facilitate the efficiencies of new high-speed wallboard manufacturing lines and improve the efficiencies of the slower wallboard manufacturing lines. Although the machine was designed primarily to manufacture gypsum liner products, we are also able to manufacture several alternative products, including containerboard grades and lightweight packaging grades. 
 Our paper machine allows the paperboard operation to manufacture high-strength gypsum liner that is approximately 10% to 15% lighter in basis weight than what is generally available in the U.S. The low-
 

17


basis weight product utilizes less recycled fiber to produce paper that, in turn, requires less energy (natural gas) to evaporate moisture from the board during the gypsum wallboard manufacturing process. The low-basis weight paper also reduces the overall finished board weight, providing our Wallboard operations with more competitive transportation costs for both the inbound and outbound segments. 
 During 2020, we completed a project to enhance and expand our papermill, which has been sold out for several years. The project enabled us to increase line speeds and lower our operating costs, and increased the annual capacity at the paper mill to approximately 390,000 tons.
 Demand, Sales, and Distribution 
 Our manufactured recycled paperboard products are sold to gypsum wallboard manufacturers and other industrial users. During fiscal 2021, approximately 40% of the recycled paperboard sold by our paper mill was consumed by the Company’s Gypsum Wallboard manufacturing operations. We have contracts with two other gypsum wallboard manufacturers that expire in the next three to four years, that represent approximately 50% of our total segment revenue, with the remaining volume shipped to other gypsum wallboard manufacturers. The loss of any of these contracts or a termination or reduction of their current production of gypsum wallboard, unless replaced by a commercially similar arrangement, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 
 The principal raw materials in recycled paperboard are recycled paper fiber (recovered waste paper), water, and specialty paper chemicals. The largest waste paper source used by the operation is old cardboard containers (known as OCC). A blend of high grades (white papers consisting of ink-free papers, such as news blank and unprinted papers) is used in the gypsum liner facing paper, white top linerboard, and white bag liner grades. 
 We believe that an adequate supply of recycled paper fiber will continue to be available from sources located within a reasonable proximity of the paper mill. Although we have the capability to receive rail shipments, the vast majority of the recycled fiber purchased is delivered via truck. Prices are subject to market fluctuations based on generation of material (supply), demand, and the presence of the export market. Fiber pricing, on average, increased in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. Most of the increase occurred in the fiscal first and fourth quarters, with the price declining slightly in the fiscal second and third quarters. We expect fiber prices to increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, then remain flat for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Current gypsum liner customer contracts include price escalators that partially offset and compensate for changes in raw material fiber prices. The chemicals used in the paper making operation, including size, retention aids, biocides, and bacteria controls, are readily available from several manufacturers at competitive prices. 
 The manufacture of recycled paperboard involves the use of a large volume of water in the production process. We have an agreement with the City of Lawton municipal services for supply of water to our manufacturing facility. Electricity, natural gas, and other utilities are available to us at either contracted rates or standard industrial rates in adequate supplies. These utilities are subject to standard industrial curtailment provisions. 
 Paperboard operations are generally large consumers of energy, mostly natural gas and electricity. Electricity is supplied to the paper mill by Public Service of Oklahoma (PSO) and they have requested a significant increase in rates for fiscal 2022. Oklahoma is a regulated state for electricity services, and all rate change requests must be presented to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission for review and approval before implementation. At this time, we are unable to estimate how much of the increase will be 
 

18


granted by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. This power company has been moving its fuel source dependency to natural gas, which could affect our electricity rates in future years. Natural gas costs in fiscal 2021 increased compared with fiscal 2020. Natural gas costs were trending lower in fiscal 2021 until Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, when the spike in natural gas prices increased the average cost for fiscal 2021 above the average cost for fiscal 2020. 
 Environmental Matters 
 There were no capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our Recycled Paperboard operations during fiscal 2021, and none are expected in fiscal 2022.
