Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Alleghany Corporation owns and supports certain operating subsidiaries and manages investments, anchored by a core position in property and casualty reinsurance and insurance. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1984. Through TransRe, an Alleghany subsidiary since March 2012, we are engaged in the property and casualty reinsurance business. Through AIHL, a wholly-owned intermediate holding company, we are engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. AIHL’s principal insurance company subsidiaries are RSUI and CapSpecialty. RSUI and CapSpecialty have been subsidiaries of AIHL since July 2003 and January 2002, respectively. AIHL Re, a Vermont captive reinsurance company which provides reinsurance to Alleghany’s current and former insurance operating subsidiaries and affiliates, has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIHL since its formation in May 2006. 
 Although our primary sources of revenues and earnings are our reinsurance and insurance operations and investments, we also generate revenues and earnings from a diverse portfolio of middle-market businesses that are owned and managed through our wholly-owned subsidiary Alleghany Capital. Alleghany Capital’s businesses include: PCT; Kentucky Trailer; IPS; Jazwares; W&W|AFCO Steel; Concord; and a 45 percent equity interest in Wilbert Funeral Services, Inc., or “Wilbert.” 
 In addition, we own certain other holding company investments. Our wholly-owned subsidiary SORC, headquartered in Golden, Colorado, is an exploration and production company focused on enhanced oil recovery. Our wholly-owned subsidiary Alleghany Properties owns and manages certain properties in the Sacramento, California region. Our public equity investments are managed primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary Roundwood. 
 As of December 31, 2019, we had total assets of $26.9 billion and total stockholders’ equity attributable to Alleghany stockholders of $8.8 billion. 
 Our principal executive offices are located in leased office space at 1411 Broadway, 34th Floor, New York, New York, 10018. Our telephone number is (212) 752-1356.

 Segment Information 
 Our segments are reported in a manner consistent with the way management evaluates the businesses. As such, we classify our businesses into three reportable segments – reinsurance, insurance and Alleghany Capital. Reinsurance and insurance underwriting activities are evaluated separately from investment and other activities. 
 Corporate activities are not classified as a segment. The primary components of corporate activities are Alleghany Properties, SORC and activities at the Alleghany parent company. 
 In 2019, our reinsurance and insurance segments constituted the majority of our total consolidated revenues, as follows:

Reinsurance Segment 
 General. The reinsurance segment consists of property and casualty reinsurance operations conducted by TransRe’s reinsurance operating subsidiaries. TransRe’s operating subsidiaries also write a modest amount of property and casualty insurance business, which is included in the reinsurance segment. 
 TransRe, through its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries Transatlantic Reinsurance Company, or “TRC,” TransRe London Ltd., or “TRL,” and TransRe Europe S.A., or “TRESA,” provides property and casualty reinsurance to insurance and other reinsurance companies. These products are distributed both through brokers and on a direct basis in the domestic and foreign markets. Domestically, TransRe is headquartered in New York, New York and has seven other office locations in the U.S. TransRe also has operations worldwide, including: Africa, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, Asia (where it has five locations), South America (where it has two locations) and the U.K. and Europe (where it has five locations). TRC is licensed, accredited or otherwise approved as a reinsurer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico and Guam. TRC is also licensed in Bermuda, Canada, Japan, the U.K., Mexico, several countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Australia and Singapore. In addition, TRL is licensed as a reinsurer in the U.K. and India and TRESA is licensed as a reinsurer in Luxembourg and Dubai. 
 The reinsurance segment constitutes the majority of our consolidated net premiums written and is reported through two major product lines, “property” and “casualty & other.”

 Reinsurance contracts are generally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. TransRe provides property and casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis. Treaty reinsurance is a contractual arrangement that provides for the automatic reinsuring of all or a portion of a specified class of risk underwritten by the ceding company. Facultative reinsurance is the reinsurance of individual risks. Rather than agreeing to reinsure all or a portion of a class of risk, the reinsurer separately rates and underwrites each risk. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased for risks not covered by treaty reinsurance or for individual risks covered by reinsurance treaties that are in need of capacity beyond that provided by such treaties. 
A ceding company’s reinsurance program may involve pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis. TransRe provides pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance for most major lines of business. Under pro rata reinsurance (also referred to as proportional or quota share reinsurance), the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion, and such proportional sharing of losses may be subject to a predetermined limit. As pro rata business is a proportional sharing of premiums and losses between the ceding company and the reinsurer, generally the underwriting results of such business more closely reflect the underwriting results of the business ceded than do the results of excess-of-loss business. In pro rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission, which is generally based on the ceding company’s cost of obtaining the business being reinsured, such as brokers’ and agents’ commissions, local taxes and administrative expenses. Under excess-of-loss reinsurance (also referred to as non-proportional reinsurance), the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company for all or a portion of the losses in excess of a predetermined amount, usually up to a predetermined limit. Premiums paid by the ceding company to the reinsurer for excess-of-loss coverage are generally not proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. Often there is no ceding commission on excess-of-loss reinsurance and therefore the pricing mechanism used by reinsurers in those instances is a rate applicable to premiums of the individual policy or policies subject to the reinsurance agreement. Both pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. 
 In July 2016, TransRe entered into a five-year agreement with General Reinsurance Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., for TransRe to act as exclusive underwriting manager on behalf of General Reinsurance Corporation for U.S. and Canadian property and casualty treaty reinsurance business produced by brokers and intermediaries. Fees earned under this agreement are included in noninsurance revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income. 
 As of December 31, 2019, the statutory surplus of TRC was $4.9 billion, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles, or “SAP,” and the consolidated equity of TransRe was $5.2 billion, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or “GAAP.” 
 Distribution. TransRe provides property and casualty reinsurance through brokers as well as directly to insurance and reinsurance companies in domestic and foreign markets. In 2019, approximately 81 percent of TransRe’s gross premiums written were written through brokers with the balance written directly with ceding company clients. In the reinsurance brokerage industry, brokers 
 49


are engaged by the ceding companies to place reinsurance on their behalf. In 2019, companies controlled by Aon plc, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and TigerRisk Partners, LLC were TransRe’s largest brokerage sources of business, accounting for approximately 26 percent, 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of gross premiums written. The reinsurance brokerage industry is dominated by certain of these brokers. Due to the substantial percentages of premiums written through these brokers, the loss of business from any one of them could have a material adverse effect on TransRe’s business. 
 Underwriting. TransRe’s underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among TransRe’s underwriters, actuaries, claims staff and senior management, as appropriate. Treaties are reviewed for compliance with TransRe’s underwriting guidelines and objectives, and most treaties are evaluated in part based upon actuarial analyses conducted by TransRe. TransRe’s actuaries are independent from the underwriting department and are responsible for providing underwriters objective account analyses utilizing available industry and account-specific data along with industry and proprietary actuarial models. TransRe’s actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and the loss experience for the risks covered. Property catastrophe-exposed treaties are generally evaluated using industry standard models, as well as proprietary TransRe models. These models are used as a guide for risk assessment and portfolio optimization and are continually updated. TransRe also frequently conducts underwriting and claims audits at the offices of a ceding company before and after entering into major treaties.  This is because reinsurers, including TransRe, do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under such treaties and, consequently, are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by the ceding company. Such dependence subjects TransRe, and reinsurers in general, to the possibility that the ceding companies have not adequately evaluated and priced the risks to be reinsured and, therefore, that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate TransRe for the risk assumed. 
 TransRe often seeks to lead treaty placements. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and therefore has significant influence in negotiating price, terms and conditions. TransRe may decline any treaty business offered to it based upon its assessment of all relevant factors. Such factors include type and level of risk assumed; actuarial and underwriting judgment with respect to rate adequacy; various treaty terms; prior and anticipated loss experience (including exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes) on the treaty; prior business experience with the ceding company; overall financial position; operating results; ratings from credit rating agencies of the ceding company; and social, legal, regulatory, environmental and general economic conditions affecting the risks assumed or the ceding company. 
 Ratings. TRC, TRL and TRESA are rated A+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, or “S&P,” and A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best Company, Inc., or “A.M. Best,” and TRC is rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service Inc., or “Moody’s.” Additional information regarding ratings and the risks related to ratings from ratings agencies can be found on page 68 of this Form 10-K. 
Insurance Segment 
 The insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance operations conducted in the U.S. by AIHL through RSUI, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and CapSpecialty, headquartered in Middleton, Wisconsin. AIHL Re, our Vermont-domiciled captive reinsurance company, provides reinsurance to our current and former insurance operating subsidiaries and affiliates. Unless we state otherwise, references to AIHL include the operations of RSUI, CapSpecialty and AIHL Re. 
 The insurance segment constitutes a smaller portion of our consolidated net premiums written and is reported through our RSUI and CapSpecialty subsidiaries.

RSUI 
 General. RSUI conducts its insurance operations through its wholly-owned insurance company subsidiaries RSUI Indemnity Company, or “RIC,” Landmark American Insurance Company, or “Landmark,” and Covington Specialty Insurance Company, or “Covington.” RSUI’s operating subsidiaries write specialty insurance coverages in the property, umbrella/excess liability, general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability and professional liability lines of business. RSUI’s operating subsidiaries also write a modest amount of reinsurance business on an assumed basis, which is included in the insurance segment. 
 The market for specialty insurance coverages differs significantly from the market for standard insurance coverages. The specialty market provides coverage for hard-to-place risks that generally do not fit the underwriting criteria of the standard market, which provides coverage for largely uniform and relatively predictable exposures and is highly regulated with respect to rates and forms. 
 RSUI’s operating subsidiaries write specialty business on both an admitted and non-admitted basis. Admitted insurers are authorized to market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable from a state’s admitted insurance markets. Non-admitted insurance is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by insureds’ direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to premium rates and forms. RSUI writes admitted specialty business primarily through RIC, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer, licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Specialty business written by RIC is subject to state policy form and premium rate regulations. Most of the risks in the admitted specialty market are unique and hard-to-place in the standard market. However, rather than looking to the non-admitted market, certain policyholders procure such specialty coverage from an admitted insurance company based on regulatory and/or marketing concerns. As an admitted carrier, RIC is subject to more state regulation than a non-admitted carrier, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various state associations, such as state guaranty funds and assigned risk plans. 
 RSUI writes business on a surplus lines eligible, non-admitted basis primarily through Landmark, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer. As a surplus lines eligible, non-admitted insurance company, Landmark is not subject to state policy form and premium rate regulations and thus has more flexibility in setting rates and coverages for specialized or hard-to-place risks. This typically results in policies with higher premiums and more restrictive coverage provisions than coverages written by a standard insurance company. As of December 31, 2019, Landmark was approved to write business on a non-admitted basis in all 50 states. 
 Covington, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer, was formed in September 2007 to, among other things, issue surplus lines policies written primarily by RSUI.  Through RSUI’s binding authority department, Covington writes small, specialized coverages pursuant to underwriting authority arrangements with managing general agents. 
 Pursuant to quota share arrangements, in place since 2009, Landmark and Covington cede 90 percent of all their respective premiums and losses, gross of third-party reinsurance, to RIC. 
 As of December 31, 2019, the statutory surplus of RIC was approximately $1.8 billion, the statutory surplus of Landmark was approximately $157 million, the statutory surplus of Covington was approximately $52 million, each as determined in accordance with SAP, and the consolidated equity of RSUI was $1.9 billion, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Distribution. As of December 31, 2019, RSUI conducted its insurance business through approximately 101 independent wholesale insurance brokers located throughout the U.S. and 24 managing general agents. RSUI’s wholesale brokers are appointed based on management’s appraisal of expertise, premium production potential, loss history with other insurance companies that they represent and the size and experience of the agency. A wholesale broker’s operations are appointed to distribute RSUI’s products on a location by location basis. Producer agreements which stipulate premium collection, payment terms and commission arrangements are in place with each wholesale broker. No wholesale broker holds underwriting, claims or reinsurance authority for RSUI. RSUI’s top five producing wholesale brokers accounted for approximately 75 percent of gross premiums written by RSUI in 2019. RSUI’s top two producing wholesale brokers, CRC Insurance Services, Inc. and AmWINS Group, Inc., accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 45 percent of RSUI’s gross premiums written in 2019. RSUI has entered into underwriting authority arrangements with 24 managing general agents for small, specialized coverages. 
 Underwriting. RSUI’s underwriting philosophy is based on handling only product lines in which its underwriters have underwriting expertise. RSUI generally focuses on higher severity, lower frequency specialty risks that can be effectively “desk underwritten” without the need for inspection or engineering reviews. RSUI tracks underwriting results for each of its underwriters and believes that the underwriting systems and applications it has in place facilitate efficient underwriting and high productivity levels. Underwriting authority is delegated on a “top-down” basis ultimately to individual underwriters based on experience and expertise. This authority is in writing and addresses maximum limits, excluded classes and coverages and premium size referral. Referral to a product line manager is required for risks exceeding an underwriter’s authority. 
 Ratings. RIC, Landmark and Covington are each rated A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best and all three companies are rated “A” by S&P. RIC and Landmark are rated A2 by Moody’s.

CapSpecialty 
 General. CapSpecialty, primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Capitol Indemnity Corporation, or “CIC,” Capitol Specialty Insurance Corporation, or “CSIC,” and Platte River Insurance Company, or “Platte River,” operates in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Through October 1, 2019, CapSpecialty also included the operations and results of Professional Risk Management Services, Inc., which was acquired from TransRe in 2014 and resold to TransRe effective October 1, 2019. 
 CIC conducts its property and casualty insurance business on an admitted basis throughout the U.S. CIC also writes surety products such as commercial surety bonds and contract surety bonds on a national basis. Commercial surety bonds include all surety bonds other than contract surety bonds and cover obligations typically required by law or regulation, such as licenses and permits. CIC offers contract surety bonds in the non-construction segment of the market which secure performance under supply, service and maintenance contracts. 
 CSIC conducts all of its business on an authorized, non-admitted basis nationally and writes primarily specialty lines of property and casualty insurance, including the professional lines of business. 
 Platte River is licensed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and operates in conjunction with CIC, primarily providing surety products and offering pricing flexibility in those jurisdictions where both CIC and Platte River are licensed. 
 Effective January 1, 2014, CapSpecialty was recapitalized pursuant to a series of transactions which included the exchange by AIHL of its common stock in CapSpecialty for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock carrying a five percent preference, or the “Preferred Stock,” and the subsequent sale by AIHL to TransRe of 24.9 percent of the Preferred Stock for a cash purchase price based on CapSpecialty’s December 31, 2013 GAAP book value. At the same time, CapSpecialty reserved shares of restricted common stock, or the “Restricted Stock,” which were subordinate to the Preferred Stock, for issuance to the management of CapSpecialty pursuant to a restricted stock plan. In connection with the July 2019 retirement of CapSpecialty’s chief executive officer, AIHL repurchased the Restricted Stock issued to CapSpecialty management, and TransRe transferred its Preferred Stock to Alleghany.
 AIHL Re and CapSpecialty entered into an intercompany reinsurance contract, effective July 1, 2015, pursuant to which AIHL Re provides CapSpecialty with coverage primarily for adverse development on certain net loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses, or “LAE,” in excess of its carried reserves at June 30, 2015. AIHL Re’s commitments are intended to cover the statutory collateral requirements at CapSpecialty, if and when necessary, and AIHL Re’s obligations are subject to an aggregate limit of $50.0 million. See Note 5(e) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional detail on the intercompany reinsurance contract. 
 As of December 31, 2019, the statutory surplus of CIC was approximately $274 million, which included the statutory surplus of CSIC of approximately $60 million and the statutory surplus of Platte River of approximately $52 million, each as determined in accordance with SAP. As of December 31, 2019, the consolidated equity of CapSpecialty was $395 million, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Distribution. CapSpecialty conducts its insurance business through independent wholesale brokerage and retail agents and general insurance agents located throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2019, CapSpecialty had 71 general agents licensed to write property and casualty and surety coverages, approximately 192 brokers specializing in professional liability coverages and approximately 243 independent agents licensed to write surety coverages only. Certain independent agents have binding authority for specific business owner policy products, including property and liability coverages and non-contract surety products. 
 Underwriting. Elements of CapSpecialty’s underwriting process include prudent risk selection, appropriate pricing and coverage customization. All accounts are reviewed on an individual basis to determine underwriting acceptability. CapSpecialty is a subscriber to the Insurance Service Organization, or “ISO,” and the Surety and Fidelity Association of America, or “SFAA,” insurance reference resources recognized by the insurance industry. CapSpecialty’s underwriting procedures, rates and contractual coverage obligations are based on procedures and data developed by ISO for property and casualty lines and by SFAA for surety lines. Underwriting acceptability is determined by type of business, claims experience, length of time in business and business experience, age and condition of premises occupied and financial stability. Information is obtained from, among other sources, agent applications, financial reports and on-site loss control surveys. If an account does not meet pre-determined acceptability parameters, coverage is declined. If an in-force policy becomes unprofitable due to extraordinary claims activity or inadequate premium levels, a non-renewal notice is issued in accordance with individual state statutes and rules. 
 Ratings. CIC, CSIC and Platte River are rated A (Excellent) by A.M. Best. 
 PacificComp 
 On December 31, 2017, AIHL sold PacificComp to CopperPoint Mutual Insurance Company, or “CopperPoint,” for total cash consideration of approximately $158 million, at which time: (i) approximately $442 million of PacificComp assets, consisting primarily of debt securities, and approximately $316 million of PacificComp liabilities, consisting primarily of loss and LAE reserves, were transferred to CopperPoint; and (ii) AIHL recorded an after-tax gain of approximately $16 million, which included a tax benefit. In connection with the transaction, AIHL Re provides adverse development reinsurance coverage on PacificComp’s pre-acquisition

Catastrophe Risk Management 
 Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are exposed to natural catastrophe events, such as hurricanes, other windstorms and earthquakes, and man-made catastrophe events such as a major terrorist event, the bankruptcy of a major company or a marine or an aviation disaster. These natural or man-made catastrophe events may expose our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to underwriting losses across multiple lines of business and, in any given year, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  The extent of losses caused by catastrophes is a function of the amount and type of insured exposure in the area affected by the event, as well as the severity of the event, potentially mitigated by any reinsurance coverage purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries take certain measures to mitigate the impact of catastrophe events, including considering catastrophe risks in their underwriting and pricing decisions, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and managing exposure in key geographic zones and product lines that are prone to catastrophe events. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries also use reinsurance to further limit their exposure to catastrophes, as is discussed in more detail under “Reinsurance Protection” below. 
 We assess the probability of occurrence and severity of catastrophe events through the use of industry recognized models and other techniques. Where appropriate, we supplement these models with our own assessment of exposures which, in our view, may not be appropriately captured by these models. In addition, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries use modeled loss scenarios and internal analyses to set risk retention levels and help structure their reinsurance programs in an effort to ensure that single zone and aggregate catastrophe exposures conform to established subsidiary and group-level risk tolerances and fit within the existing exposure portfolio.  Our loss estimates for zonal and aggregate catastrophe exposures are updated and reviewed against tolerances as part of our risk oversight processes on a quarterly basis. Risk tolerances are subject to change based on our view of the risk-return characteristics of business being underwritten.
 There is no single standard methodology or set of industry standard assumptions to project possible losses related to catastrophe exposures and the form and quality of the data obtained, including data obtained from insureds and ceding companies, and used in these models are not uniformly compatible with the data requirements of all models. Therefore, the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Finally, these modeled losses may not be comparable with estimates made by other companies. 
 Reinsurance Protection 
 General 
 Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the risks they underwrite in order to reduce the effect of individual or aggregate exposure to losses, manage capacity, protect capital resources, reduce volatility in specific lines of business, improve risk-adjusted portfolio returns and enable them to increase gross premium writings and risk-capacity without requiring additional capital. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries generally purchase reinsurance and retrocessional coverages from highly-rated, third-party reinsurers. If the assuming reinsurers are unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the applicable reinsurance agreements, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries would remain liable for such reinsurance portion not paid by these reinsurers. As such, funds, trust agreements and letters of credit are held to collateralize a portion of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries’ reinsurance recoverables, and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the risks they underwrite or assume with multiple reinsurance programs. 
 TransRe enters into various retrocession arrangements, including property catastrophe retrocession contracts, to manage the effects of individual or aggregate exposure to losses, reduce volatility in specific lines of business, improve risk-adjusted portfolio returns, strengthen its market position and enhance capital efficiency. These include excess-of-loss and quota share treaties in traditional rated form, as well as catastrophe bonds and other collateralized insurance-linked structures. TransRe’s retrocession protections generally have a one-year term and renewal dates occur throughout the year, with the majority renewing at January 1 and June 1.  The catastrophe bonds, however, have a four-year term, with maturities in 2022 and 2023.
 RSUI reinsures its property lines of business through a program consisting of surplus share treaties, facultative placements, per risk and catastrophe excess-of-loss treaties. RSUI’s catastrophe reinsurance program and property per risk reinsurance program each run on an annual basis from May 1 to the following April 30 and portions of these programs expired on April 30, 2019. Both programs were renewed on May 1, 2019 with substantially similar terms as the expired programs. 
 Terrorism Act 
 With respect to potential losses arising from acts of terrorism, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as extended and amended, most recently by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which we collectively refer to as the “Terrorism Act,” established a program to provide federal assistance to the insurance industry in order to meet the needs of commercial insurance policyholders for coverages against losses due to certain acts of terrorism. The Terrorism Act fixes the insurer deductible at 20 percent of an insurer’s direct earned premium of the preceding calendar year. The Terrorism Act also initially fixed the federal share of compensation at 85 percent of insured losses that exceed insurer deductibles. As provided in the Terrorism Act, beginning on January 1, 2016, the federal share began to decrease by 1 percentage point per calendar year and will continue to 
 55


decrease on that basis until the federal share is equal to 80 percent. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law a seven-year extension of the Terrorism Act continuing through 2027. The Terrorism Act is administered by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. 
 The Terrorism Act applies to foreign or domestic acts of terrorism occurring within the U.S. (including in the U.S. territorial sea and the Outer Continental Shelf), at U.S. missions abroad or on U.S. flag vessels or aircraft. In return for requiring insurers writing certain lines of property and casualty insurance to offer coverage to commercial insurance policyholders against specified acts of terrorism, the Terrorism Act requires the U.S. federal government to reimburse such insurers for the federal share (80 percent, as of January 1, 2020) of insured losses during a program year resulting from such acts of terrorism above a statutorily-defined deductible. In addition, federal reimbursement will only be paid under the Terrorism Act if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a covered act of terrorism exceed $200.0 million for insured losses occurring in 2020, but no payment will be made for any portion of aggregate industry insured losses that exceeds $100.0 billion during a particular calendar year. 
 In general, TransRe does not provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism, as defined by the Terrorism Act, but it is nonetheless exposed to potential losses related to both certified and uncertified acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere, such as from terrorism-specific treaty coverages offered to ceding companies or terrorism risk pools outside of the U.S. on a limited basis, and with respect to other lines of business from the assumption of terrorism risk in marine, aviation and other casualty treaties. Although TransRe assumes such terrorism risk after careful underwriting consideration and, in many cases, with limitations, a major terrorist event could have a material adverse impact on TransRe and us. 
 Approximately 11 percent of all policies and approximately 10 percent of property policies written by RSUI in 2019 contained coverage for domestic and foreign acts of terrorism. RSUI uses various underwriting strategies to mitigate its exposure to terrorism losses. In addition, its casualty reinsurance programs provide coverage for domestic and foreign acts of terrorism. RSUI’s property reinsurance programs provide coverage only for domestic acts of terrorism and, as a result, RSUI is liable for losses under property policies that provide coverage for foreign acts of terrorism, subject to potential Terrorism Act reimbursement. 
 Reinsurance Security Committee 
 We have established a Reinsurance Security Committee, which includes certain of our officers and the chief financial officers (or their designees) of each of TransRe, RSUI and CapSpecialty. The Reinsurance Security Committee meets to track, analyze and manage the use of reinsurance by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The Reinsurance Security Committee also considers and oversees the limits on the maximum amount of unsecured reinsurance recoverables that should be outstanding from any particular reinsurer, the lines of business that should be ceded to a particular reinsurer and, where applicable, the types of collateral that should be posted by a reinsurer. As of December 31, 2019, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries had total reinsurance recoverables of $1,682.0 million, consisting of $1,583.9 million of ceded outstanding loss and LAE and $98.1 million of recoverables on paid losses. The reinsurance purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries does not relieve them from their obligations to their policyholders and cedants and, therefore, the financial strength of their reinsurers is important. Approximately 66 percent of our reinsurance recoverables balance as of December 31, 2019 was due from reinsurers having an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Excellent) or higher, with a majority of the other reinsurance recoverables being secured by funds held, trust agreements or letters of credit. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries had no allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as of December 31, 2019. Information related to concentration of reinsurance recoverables can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Reinsurance Recoverables” of this Form 10-K and Note 5(b) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Information regarding the risks faced by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries with respect to their use of reinsurance can be found on pages 67 and 68 of this Form 10-K. 
Competition 
 The reinsurance and insurance industry is highly competitive, and industry consolidation has created an even more competitive business environment. Competition in the businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of the company, premiums charged, other terms and conditions offered, services provided, commissions paid to producers, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines of business to be written. 
 Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries compete with a large number of major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers and insurers in their selected lines of business, including regional companies, mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies, government-owned or subsidized facilities, European underwriting syndicates and diversified financial services companies. In our reinsurance segment, TransRe’s property and casualty businesses compete on a worldwide basis. In our insurance segment, RSUI’s property and casualty businesses, and CapSpecialty’s admitted property and casualty businesses and surety and non-admitted specialty businesses, compete on a national basis. Some of these competitors have significantly more premiums, capital and resources than our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. 
 56


In addition to competition from the reinsurance industry, TransRe faces competition from the capital markets, as well as some traditional reinsurers, which from time to time produce alternative products or reinsurance vehicles (such as collateralized reinsurance, reinsurance securitizations, catastrophe bonds and various derivatives, such as swaps and sidecars) that may compete with certain types of reinsurance, such as property catastrophe. Hedge funds also provide reinsurance and retrocessional protections through captive companies or other alternative transactions on a fully collateralized basis for property and energy catastrophe business. Over time, these initiatives could significantly affect supply, pricing and competition in the reinsurance industry. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may also compete with new entrants into the reinsurance and insurance markets, including companies with new or “disruptive” technologies or business models.
 A discussion of the risks faced by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries due to competition within, and the cyclicality of, the reinsurance and insurance businesses can be found on pages 66 and 67 of this Form 10-K. 
 The various industries in which Alleghany Capital’s subsidiaries operate are highly competitive, though the nature and degree of such competition varies greatly by company and industry.  Competition is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength, expertise and reputation of the company, the quality and timeliness of the goods and services being provided, prices charged for goods and services and other contractual terms and conditions associated with the sale of goods and services.

Regulation 
 General 
 Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations applicable to insurance and reinsurance companies, although the degree and type of regulation varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We expect the scope and extent of regulation globally, as well as regulatory oversight generally, to continue to increase. The material regulations under which we operate are described below. 
 U.S. Regulation 
 Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they are licensed to conduct business. The extent of this regulation varies, but state insurance laws and regulations generally govern the financial condition of 
 57


reinsurers and insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentrations of permissible investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy. In addition, state insurance laws and regulations govern the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling and require the approval of nearly all rates, policy forms and related materials for lines of insurance. U.S. insurance regulation generally aims to protect policyholders and to ensure that insurance companies remain solvent.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the “NAIC,” which is discussed below, reviewed all aspects of financial regulation affecting insurance companies following the 2008 financial crisis.  In furtherance of this initiative, the NAIC adopted new model laws, and numerous states subsequently enacted new laws and regulations, which have updated the U.S. insurance solvency framework. 
 Insurance Holding Company Regulation. As an insurance holding company, we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws enacted in those states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or where they conduct business. These laws generally require insurance companies controlled by a holding company to register and file with their domestic insurance regulators information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, including dividends and distributions and general business operations. 
 The insurance holding company laws of some states, including with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions, may be more restrictive than the insurance holding company laws of other states. Under these laws, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may not pay an “extraordinary” dividend or distribution without the prior approval of the domestic state insurance regulators. The insurance laws of New York, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, which represent some of our domiciliary states, utilize a more restrictive “lesser than” calculation for determining whether a distribution constitutes an extraordinary dividend, thereby requiring prior regulatory approval.  In New York, for instance, an extraordinary dividend means a dividend which, together with all dividends declared during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of 10 percent of the insurer’s surplus to policyholders as shown by its last annual statement, or 100 percent of adjusted net investment income during such period.  In contrast, the insurance laws of other states, such as Delaware and Nebraska, where certain of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, utilize a less restrictive “greater than” test for extraordinary dividend calculations.  In Delaware, for example, an extraordinary dividend includes any dividend, together with other dividends made within the preceding 12 months, that exceeds the greater of: (i) 10 percent of such insurer’s surplus as regards to policyholders as of the preceding year end; or (ii) the net income, excluding realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period ending the preceding year end. In addition, certain states where Alleghany’s reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled prohibit a domestic insurance company from paying ordinary and extraordinary dividends except out of earned surplus. 
 In addition, insurance holding company laws and regulations to which we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject generally require prior notification and approval or non-disapproval by the domiciliary insurance regulators of certain other significant transactions, including sales, loans, reinsurance agreements and service agreements between an insurer subsidiary, on the one hand, and its holding company or other subsidiaries of the holding company, on the other hand. 
 Insurance holding company laws and regulations to which we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject also generally require the ultimate controlling person of the reinsurer or insurer to comply with certain informational requirements with the purpose of protecting such reinsurer or insurer from enterprise risk, including requiring the ultimate controlling person to file with the group’s lead state insurance regulator an annual enterprise risk report (also known as a Form F) that identifies the risks within the insurance holding company system that could have a material impact on the financial condition or liquidity of the reinsurer or insurer or the entire insurance holding company system.
 The insurance holding company laws and regulations of the states in which our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled also generally require that, before a person can acquire direct or indirect control of a reinsurer or an insurer domiciled in the state (or any person controlling such domestic insurer or reinsurer), prior written approval must be obtained from the insurer’s domiciliary state insurance regulator. In determining whether to approve a person’s direct or indirect acquisition of control over an insurance company, the state insurance regulators are required to consider various factors, including the financial strength of the acquirer, the integrity and management experience of the acquirer’s board of directors and executive officers and the acquirer’s plans for the future operations of the reinsurer or insurer. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, “control” over a reinsurer or an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of that reinsurer or insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of the ultimate controlling person’s common stock. 
 The acquisition of control laws described above may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. 
 Risk Management. State insurance laws enacted in nearly all U.S. states (including all of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled) require reinsurers and insurers that exceed certain specified premium thresholds to maintain a framework for managing the risks associated with their entire holding company group, including non-insurance companies. In addition, these laws require that, at least annually, the reinsurer or insurer must prepare a summary report, or the “ORSA Report,” regarding its internal assessment of risk management and capital adequacy for the entire holding company group. The ORSA Report is 
 58


filed, on a confidential basis, with the insurance holding company group’s lead state regulator and made available to other domiciliary regulators within the holding company group. 
 Corporate Governance. The NAIC has adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Regulation, or the “Corporate Governance Model Act,” which, following enactment at the state level, will require insurers and reinsurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices. As of December 31, 2019, the Corporate Governance Model Act had been adopted in full or in substantial part in approximately 43 states, including some of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Effective January 1, 2020, the provisions of the Corporate Governance Model Act must be adopted by a state in order to maintain its NAIC accreditation. The Corporate Governance Model Act is therefore expected to be adopted in full or substantial part by the remaining states over the next year. 
 Group Supervision and Group Capital. In response to international developments, the NAIC has established procedures for the supervision of domestic and international insurance groups, including those groups with both insurance and non-insurance entities. The NAIC has also adopted amendments to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation, or the “Model Holding Company Act,” which, following enactment at the state level, would authorize U.S. regulators to lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of certain international insurance groups. As of December 31, 2019, these amendments to the Model Holding Company Act had been adopted by approximately 42 states, including some of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Effective January 1, 2020, these amendments to the Model Holding Company Act must be adopted by a state in order to maintain its NAIC accreditation. The amendments to the Model Holding Company Act are therefore expected to be adopted in full or substantial part by the remaining states over the next year. 
 Additionally, the NAIC is continuing to develop a group capital calculation tool using a risk-based capital, or “RBC,” aggregation methodology for all entities in an insurance holding company system. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all companies regardless of their structure. The NAIC has stated that the calculation will be a regulatory tool and does not constitute a requirement or standard. The field testing phase began in mid-May 2019 and it was completed in the fall.  The NAIC expects to adopt the final group capital calculation tool in 2020.  We cannot predict what impact this proposed capital calculation may have on our operations.  The amendments to the Model Holding Company Act regarding group supervision and proposals regarding group capital relate to the standards incorporated in the U.S./EU Covered Agreement, discussed below.  
 Cybersecurity. The NAIC has adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which, when adopted by the states, will require insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to comply with certain requirements under state insurance laws, such as developing and maintaining a written information security program, conducting risk assessments and overseeing the data security practices of third-party vendors. To date, the Insurance Data Security Model Law has only been adopted by a few states, including some of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled.  In addition, certain states are developing or have developed regulations that may impose regulatory requirements related to cybersecurity on insurance and reinsurance companies (potentially including insurance and reinsurance companies that are not domiciled, but are licensed, in the relevant state). For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services adopted a regulation pertaining to cybersecurity for all banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction, effective as of March 1, 2017, which applies to us. 
 Rates and Policy Forms. The policy forms and various premium rates and rates for property or casualty or surety insurance policies of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in every state in which they conduct business. In many states, rates and policy forms must be filed with the applicable insurance regulator prior to their use, and in some states, rates and forms must be affirmatively approved by the applicable insurance regulator prior to use. 
 The rates and coverage terms of reinsurance agreements with non-affiliates are generally not subject to regulation by any governmental authority. As a practical matter, however, the rates charged by primary insurers and the policy terms of primary insurance agreements may affect the rates charged and the policy terms under associated reinsurance agreements. 
 Market Conduct Examinations. The insurance laws and regulations to which our insurance companies are subject govern their marketplace activities, affecting the form and content of disclosure to consumers, product illustrations, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices and complaint and claims handling. These provisions are generally enforced through periodic market conduct examinations. Such insurance laws and regulations also govern the licensing of insurance companies and agents and regulate trade practices. 
 Periodic Financial Reporting and Risk-Based Capital. Reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S. are required to report their financial condition and results of operations in accordance with SAP prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulators in conjunction with the NAIC. State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, perform periodic financial examinations of reinsurers and insurers, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, establish standards for permissible types and amounts of investments and require minimum capital and surplus levels. These statutory capital and surplus requirements include RBC rules promulgated by the NAIC. These RBC standards are intended to assess the level of risk inherent in a reinsurance or an insurance company’s business and consider items such as asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and other business risks relevant to its operations. In accordance with RBC formulas, a company’s RBC requirements are calculated and compared with 
 59


its total adjusted capital to determine whether the company may be undercapitalized and whether regulatory intervention is warranted. As of December 31, 2019, the total adjusted capital of our U.S. domiciled reinsurance and insurance companies exceeded the minimum levels required under applicable RBC rules, and each had excess capacity to write additional premiums in relation to these requirements. Specifically, as of December 31, 2019, the amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements was not significant in relation to the actual statutory capital and surplus of our reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S. 
 The NAIC annually calculates certain statutory financial ratios for most reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S. These calculations are known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or “IRIS,” ratios. There are thirteen IRIS ratios for property/casualty insurers, with each ratio having an established “usual range” of results. The IRIS ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. A ratio falling outside the usual range is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. The NAIC reports the ratios to state insurance departments that may then contact a company if four or more of its ratios fall outside the NAIC’s usual ranges. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are not currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on their respective IRIS ratios. 
 Guarantee Associations and Similar Arrangements. Certain U.S. insurance companies are required under the guaranty fund laws of most states in which they transact business to pay assessments up to certain prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Our U.S. insurance companies also are required to participate in various involuntary pools, principally involving windstorms. 
 Statutory Accounting Principles. State insurance regulators have developed SAP as a basis of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of reinsurers and insurers. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring a reinsurer’s or insurer’s surplus to policyholders. Accordingly, SAP focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of a reinsurer or insurer at financial reporting dates in accordance with applicable insurance laws and regulations in the state in which such reinsurer or insurer is domiciled. SAP determines, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries and thus determines, in part, the amount of funds they have available to pay as dividends. 
 GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency, but it is also concerned with other financial measurements, such as income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. Due to differences in methodology between SAP and GAAP, the values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are materially different from those reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with SAP. 
 Federal Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. As discussed in more detail under “Reinsurance Protection” above, the Terrorism Act established a federal assistance program to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims arising from terrorism-related losses and regulates the terms of insurance related to the terrorism coverage provided by our insurance companies. 
 On July 21, 2010, President Barack H. Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the “Dodd-Frank Act.” The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and required various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations. 
 It also created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or the “FSOC,” comprising the heads of federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, to identify and respond to risks to the financial stability of the U.S. and to promote market discipline. The FSOC is authorized to designate a nonbank financial company as “systemically significant,” or a “non-bank SIFI,” if its material financial distress could threaten the financial stability of the U.S. A non-bank SIFI is subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as well as enhanced prudential standards, including stress tests, liquidity requirements, annual resolution plans or “living wills,” and enhanced public disclosures. There are currently no such non-bank SIFIs designated by the FSOC.
 On February 3, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13772 on Core Principles for Regulating the U.S. Financial Systems in order to foster “vibrant financial markets through more rigorous regulatory impact analysis that addresses systemic risk and market failures” and advancing American interests in international regulatory negotiations and meetings.  On April 21, 2017, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum which instructed the Treasury Secretary to review the FSOC designation process and evaluate and report to the President on whether the FSOC’s activities related to non-bank SIFIs, including prioritizing an activities-based approach instead of individual designations, and enhancing the analytical process, engagement, and transparency of the designation process.  On December 4, 2019, the FSOC approved final guidance related to a revised process for designating non-bank SIFIs, which substantially changes the FSOC’s procedures by adopting an activities-based approach and moving away from the entities-based approach.  The final guidance became effective on January 29, 2020.  This change of measures to address systemic risk in the insurance industry could affect our reinsurance and insurance operations as could a determination that we or our counterparties are systemically significant.
 60


The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Federal Insurance Office, or the “FIO,” within the U.S. Department of the Treasury which is designed to promote national coordination within the insurance sector and which has the authority, in part, to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry, including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of reinsurers and insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the U.S. financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the FIO to assist the Secretary of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in negotiating “covered agreements” with foreign jurisdictions regarding prudential measures for the supervision of global reinsurance and insurance markets. A covered agreement may preempt a state law if the FIO determines that the state law is inconsistent with a covered agreement’s terms and treats a non-U.S. reinsurer or insurer less favorably than a U.S. reinsurer or insurer. 
 Covered Agreements and Credit for Reinsurance. Currently, our non-U.S. reinsurance companies are indirectly subject to the effects of regulatory requirements imposed by the states in which their U.S. ceding insurers are domiciled.  Under current U.S. law, an insurer is permitted to take credit on its statutory financial statements for the loss, expense or reserve obligations of its reinsurers if the reinsurer is licensed, accredited or approved in the U.S. insurer’s state of domicile or if the reinsurer posts collateral for the sole benefit of the U.S. insurer equal to 100% of the reinsurer’s obligations.  Additionally, all states permit a U.S. insurer to take credit for reinsurance ceded to a non-U.S. reinsurer that posts collateral in amounts less than 100% of the reinsurer’s obligations if the reinsurer has been designated as a “certified reinsurer” and is domiciled in a country recognized by the state and the NAIC as a “qualified jurisdiction.”  The reduced percentage of full collateral applied to a certified reinsurer is based upon an assessment of the reinsurer and its financial ratings.  
 In January 2017, the Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced their successful completion of negotiations of a covered agreement with the EU. The covered agreement addresses three areas of prudential insurance and reinsurance supervision: (i) group supervision; (ii) reinsurance; and (iii) the exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. The covered agreement was signed on September 22, 2017, and each party is undertaking its internal requirements and procedures (such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations) prior to the applicability of the covered agreement. The U.S./EU covered agreement eliminates the requirement for EU reinsurers to post reinsurance collateral in order for their U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance.  In order to be eligible for zero collateral treatment, an EU reinsurer must meet certain standards including, among others, minimum capital and solvency ratios, confirmation of financial condition by the reinsurer’s domestic regulator and claims payment standards.  Because the covered agreement may preempt an inconsistent state law that treats EU reinsurers less favorably than a U.S. reinsurer, any U.S. state credit for reinsurance law not amended by September of 2020 to incorporate the zero reinsurance collateral provisions of the covered agreement may be subject to federal preemption.  On June 25, 2019, the NAIC adopted amendments to the NAIC’s Credit for Reinsurance Model Law to conform to the requirements of the covered agreement, thus paving the way for U.S. states to similarly amend their credit for reinsurance laws and avoid potential federal preemption of these laws.  The NAIC also recently undertook steps to make its amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law an accreditation standard for the states.  The newly adopted amendments also extend the zero reinsurance collateral provisions in the U.S./EU covered agreement to eligible reinsurers domiciled in U.S. jurisdictions that are accredited by the NAIC and to non-U.S. jurisdictions that have not entered into a covered agreement with the U.S. but the NAIC has identified as “Reciprocal Jurisdictions” pursuant to the NAIC Process for Evaluating Qualified and Reciprocal Jurisdictions.  We cannot currently estimate the impact of changes to the laws and regulations as a consequence of any such adopted covered agreements on our business, financial condition or operating results.     
 In addition, the covered agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to U.S. and EU insurance groups operating in both territories. For instance, the U.S./EU covered agreement provides that U.S. insurance groups with operations in the EU will be supervised at the worldwide level only by U.S. insurance regulators (and precludes EU insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of U.S. insurers for a sixty-month period), provided those U.S. regulators apply a group capital assessment calculating risk at the worldwide group level. In anticipation of the U.K.’s pending exit from the EU, on December 20, 2018, the Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that they had signed an additional covered agreement with the U.K.  The agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. largely reflects the provisions of the covered agreement between the U.S. and the EU and incorporates the same timeframes contained within it.  The covered agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. addresses: (i) group supervision, (ii) reinsurance and (iii) the exchange of information between supervisory authorities.  We expect that, if successfully implemented, this covered agreement will resolve some of the regulatory uncertainty that will follow Brexit (as defined below) for U.S. reinsurers writing business in the U.K., as well as U.K.-based reinsurers writing business in the U.S.
 International Regulation 
 General. TransRe is regulated in various foreign jurisdictions where it conducts business. In certain jurisdictions, TransRe operates through branches or representative offices of TRC and in other jurisdictions TransRe has local reinsurance or insurance subsidiaries, such as TRL in the U.K. and TRESA in Luxembourg. 
 The extent of the regulation varies by foreign jurisdiction, but generally governs licensing requirements, solvency, currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves and amount and type of local investments. International operations and assets held abroad may be materially and adversely affected by economic, political and other developments in foreign countries 
 61


and the U.S., including possible changes in foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, unexpected financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose and potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, as well as by the consequences of international hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. International operations are also subject to risks related to complying, or monitoring compliance, with the requirements of anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, or “OFAC,” Solvency II, and the economic and trade sanctions laws of the U.S., including but not limited to the regulations administered by the OFAC and sanctions laws implemented by other countries in which TransRe operates. Further, regulations governing technical reserves and remittance of balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. A discussion of risks unique to international operations faced by TransRe’s offices that operate in jurisdictions outside the U.S. can be found on pages 69 through 71 of this Form 10-K. 
 U.K. Regulation. Prior to December 2013, TransRe’s operations in the U.K. were conducted through a branch of TRC. Since December 2013, TransRe’s operations in the U.K. have been conducted by TRL and TRC’s branch in the U.K. TRL and TRC’s operations in the U.K. are supervised by the Prudential Regulatory Authority, or the “PRA,” which is responsible, among other things, for regulating the solvency of insurance and reinsurance companies, and the Financial Conduct Authority, or the “FCA,” which is responsible, among other things, for regulating market conduct. The PRA and the FCA have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of a regulated entity, including the power to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of its rules by authorized firms and approved persons. TRL and TRC’s branch in the U.K. is required to maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of the business conducted in accordance with PRA and FCA rules. The calculation of the margin of solvency depends on the type and amount of reinsurance business written, the type and amount of reserves held and other risk-related factors, including market risk, counterparty default risk and operational risk. 
 Luxembourg Regulation. TRESA is licensed to carry on reinsurance business in Luxembourg. As a result, TRESA is required to comply with The Law of 7 December 2015 on the Insurance Sector and the regulations and guidance issued by the Financial Supervisory Authority, or the “Commissariat aux Assurances.” Some of the significant aspects of the Luxembourg regulatory framework include complying with capital and solvency, corporate governance, risk management and internal control requirements. In addition, TRESA is subject to annual reporting requirements enacted by Commissariat aux Assurances. 
 Branch Regulation. TRC operates in a number of other jurisdictions through a series of foreign branches, including branches in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, the U.K., Switzerland and Singapore, and TRESA operates in Switzerland, Germany, France and Dubai through branches. As a result, TRC and TRESA are required, among other things, to meet local licensing, reserve, currency, investment and capital requirements for these branches. 
 Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. Our insurance business throughout the EU is subject to an EU directive known as “Solvency II,” and its implementing rules, which have been in effect since January 1, 2016. The implementation of Solvency II represented a fundamental revision to the European regulatory regime that sought to enhance transparency and risk management and encourage a proactive approach to company solvency. It is built on a risk-based approach to setting capital requirements for reinsurers and insurers. TransRe could be materially impacted by Solvency II and a key risk is that Solvency II rules may reduce TRL’s, TRESA’s and/or TRC’s branch’s regulatory solvency position by, for example, increased capital requirements or a reduction in eligible funds. Solvency II could also materially impact TransRe, given that Solvency II affects the calculation of the solvency of international groups which, like TransRe, conduct reinsurance and insurance operations both inside and outside of the EU. Other risks include more complex and intensive regulatory reporting burdens, regulatory requirements that conflict with requirements in other jurisdictions, and shortages of skilled staff in critical areas such as the actuarial function, all of which may have a negative impact on the results of TRL and TRESA, as well as the branches of TRC and the TransRe group. In addition, we could be required to undertake a significant amount of additional work if compliance with the Solvency II regime came into question which in turn may divert finite resources from other business related tasks. 
 Within the EU, EU member states, or “Member States,” are required to adopt common standards for authorizing and supervising reinsurance companies that are headquartered in a Member State. TRC operates within the EU as a “Third Country Reinsurer” under Solvency II through a series of foreign branches and on a cross-border basis. Each branch of TRC in the EU is separately authorized by the relevant regulator in the Member State in which it is established. Currently, TRC continues to conduct business within the EU through its foreign branches with no significant impact on its operations. However, TransRe could be materially and adversely affected by rules adopted by a Member State related to Third Country Reinsurers. For example, TRC may be required to post additional collateral in EU countries or may need to consider restructuring its business in order to comply with the rules adopted in EU countries related to Third Country Reinsurers. Since 2013, TransRe has been working to mitigate the risks associated with being a Third Country Reinsurer by migrating business originating in the EU from TransRe branches to TRL.
 The referendum on the U.K.’s membership in the EU was held on June 23, 2016 and resulted in a vote in favor of the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, or “Brexit.” As a result of Brexit, our U.K. operations could lose their European Economic Area financial services passporting rights. Additional information on the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit

can be found on pages 69 through 71 of this Form 10-K. In anticipation of the U.K.’s pending exit from the EU, on December 18, 2018, the Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that they had signed a new Bilateral Agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance. The agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. largely reflects the provisions of the covered agreement between the U.S. and the EU and incorporates the same timeframes contained within it.  The covered agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. addresses: (i) group supervision; (ii) reinsurance; and (iii) exchange of information between supervisory authorities. We expect that, if successfully implemented, this covered agreement will resolve some of the regulatory uncertainty that will follow Brexit for U.S. reinsurers writing business in the U.K., as well as U.K. based reinsurers writing business in the U.S. 
 In Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, People’s Republic of China and India, emerging markets where TransRe underwrites business on a cross-border basis, local regulations have recently been adopted that may operate to limit, restrict or increase the costs of TransRe’s access to these markets. If this trend continues to spread to other jurisdictions, TransRe’s ability to operate globally may be materially and adversely affected. 
 In addition to regulation within the U.S., by the EU and by the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. where TransRe operates, we may be affected by regulatory policies adopted by the IAIS. Regulators in more than 200 jurisdictions and approximately 140 countries, representing both established and emerging markets, are working with the IAIS to consider changes to reinsurer and insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system, including non-insurance companies. Current IAIS initiatives include development of a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or “ComFrame,” which has been in progress since 2010. ComFrame is intended to provide a global framework of basic standards for internationally active insurance groups, or “IAIGs,” and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of IAIGs. A final form of ComFrame was formally adopted in November 2019 at the IAIS Annual General Meeting.
 In October 2013, the IAIS announced that it intended to develop a risk-based, group-wide global insurance capital standard, or “ICS,” which will be included within ComFrame once it is finalized. Further to the IAIS’s announcement, it has undertaken two quantitative field testing exercises in 2015 and 2016, and published Consultation Documents in 2014 and 2016. This process culminated in the development of ICS Version 1.0 in 2017, which was intended for extended field testing, and the eventual development of ICS Version 2.0, which is intended for implementation. ICS Version 2.0 was adopted in November 2019 and it will undergo a five-year monitoring period starting in January 2020. During the monitoring period, ICS Version 2.0 will not trigger any supervisory action, but will be used for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges to provide feedback to the IAIS on the ICS design and performance.  
 In 2018, the IAIS announced that it would commence development of a Holistic Framework for the Supervision of Insurance Companies. This Holistic Framework also was adopted in November 2019 and will be implemented from the beginning of 2020. This framework recognizes that systemic risk can arise both from sector-wide trends with regard to specific activities and exposures, as well as from a concentration of these activities and exposures in individual insurers. The Holistic Framework consists of an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures and powers of intervention, an annual IAIS global monitoring exercise and collective discussion on the outcomes and appropriate supervisory responses.
 Regulatory Convergence 
 Regulators within and outside the U.S. are increasingly coordinating the regulation of multinational insurers by conducting a supervisory college. A supervisory college, as defined by the IAIS, is “a forum for cooperation and communication between the involved supervisors established for the fundamental purpose of facilitating the effectiveness of supervision of entities which belong to an insurance group; facilitating both the supervisor of the group as a whole on a group-wide basis and improving the legal entity supervision of the entities within the insurance group.” We continue to assess the impact, if any, such coordination may have on insurance regulation and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The New York State Department of Financial Services has advised TransRe to expect its inaugural Supervisory College in May of 2020.
 Reserves 
 Each of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries establishes reserves on its balance sheet for unpaid loss and LAE related to its property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts. The reserves for loss and LAE represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the balance sheet date. The process of estimating these reserves is inherently difficult and involves a considerable degree of judgment, especially in view of changing legal and economic environments that impact loss reserve development. Therefore, quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations and managerial judgment. In addition, conditions and trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” of this Form 10-K for additional detail on our estimation process for the liability for unpaid loss and LAE.

 Asbestos-Related Illness and Environmental Impairment Reserves 
 Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries’ reserves for loss and LAE include amounts for risks related to asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment. The reserves carried for such claims, including the reserves for loss and LAE incurred but not reported, or “IBNR,” claims, are based upon known facts and current law at the respective balance sheet dates. However, significant uncertainty exists in determining the amount of ultimate liability for asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment losses. This uncertainty is due to, among other reasons, inconsistent and changing court resolutions and judicial interpretations with respect to underlying policy intent and coverage and uncertainties as to the allocation of responsibility for resultant damages. Further, possible future changes in statutes, laws, regulations, theories of liability and other factors could have a material effect on these liabilities and, accordingly, future earnings. Although we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves, which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, may be necessary in the future, we believe that our asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment reserves were adequate as of December 31, 2019. 
 At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the reserves for asbestos-related illness liabilities were approximately nine and seven times, respectively, the average paid claims for the respective prior three year period. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the reserves for environmental impairment liabilities were approximately seven and six times, respectively, the average paid claims for the respective prior three year period. 
 The following tables present the reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross reserve balances for unpaid loss and LAE related to asbestos–related illness and environmental impairment claims of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries for the three years ended December 31, 2019.
