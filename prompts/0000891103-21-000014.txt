Item 1. Business
Who we are
Match Group, Inc., through its portfolio companies, is a leading provider of dating products available globally. Our portfolio of brands includes Tinder®, Match®, Meetic®, OkCupid®, Hinge®, Pairs™, PlentyOfFish®, and OurTime®, as well as a number of other brands, each designed to increase our users’ likelihood of finding a meaningful connection. Through our portfolio companies and their trusted brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users. Our products are available in over 40 languages to our users all over the world.
As used herein, “Match Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to Match Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries after the completion of the Separation (defined below), unless the context indicates otherwise.
Separation of Match Group and IAC
On June 30, 2020, the companies formerly known as Match Group, Inc. (referred to as “Former Match Group”) and IAC/InterActiveCorp (referred to as “Former IAC”) completed the separation of the Company from IAC through a series of transactions that resulted in two, separate public companies—(1) Match Group, which consists of the businesses of Former Match Group and certain financing subsidiaries previously owned by Former IAC, and (2) IAC/InterActiveCorp, formerly known as IAC Holdings, Inc. (“IAC”), consisting of Former IAC’s businesses other than Match Group (the “Separation”).
The following diagram illustrates the simplified organizational and ownership structure immediately prior to the Separation.
Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) dated as of December 19, 2019 and amended as of April 28, 2020 and as further amended as of June 22, 2020, Former Match Group merged with and into Match Group Holdings II, LLC (“MG Holdings II”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Match Group, with MG Holdings II surviving the merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Match Group. Former Match Group stockholders (other than Former IAC) received, through the merger, in exchange for each outstanding share of Former Match Group common stock that they held, one share of Match Group common stock and, at the holder’s election, either (i) $3.00 in cash or (ii) a fraction of a share of Match Group common stock with a value of $3.00 (calculated pursuant to the Transaction Agreement). As a result of the merger and other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, Former Match Group stockholders (other than Former IAC) became stockholders of the Company.
The following diagram illustrates the simplified organizational and ownership structure of IAC and Match Group immediately after the Separation.
The Company was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware and underwent many name changes before becoming IAC/InterActiveCorp prior to the Separation described above. Former Match Group completed an initial public offering in 2015 and had operated as a stand-alone public company since that time. Upon the Separation described above, the Company changed its name to Match Group, Inc.
The business of creating meaningful connections
Our goal is to spark meaningful connections for users around the world. Consumers’ dating preferences vary significantly, influenced in part by demographics, geography, cultural norms, religion, and intent (for example, seeking casual dating or more serious relationships). As a result, the market for dating products is fragmented, and no single product has been able to effectively serve the dating category as a whole.
Prior to the proliferation of the internet and mobile devices, human connections traditionally were limited by social circles, geography, and time. People met through work colleagues, friends and family, in school, at church, at social gatherings, in bars and restaurants, or in other social settings. Today, the adoption of mobile technology and the internet has significantly expanded the ways in which people can build relationships, create new interactions, and develop meaningful connections. Additionally, the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas across the world that previously served as barriers to individuals using technology to help find and develop those connections.
We believe that dating products serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for their users, including:
•Expanded options: Dating products provide users access to a large pool of people they otherwise would not have a chance to meet.
•Efficiency: The search and matching features, as well as the profile information available on dating products, allow users to filter a large number of individuals in a short period of time, increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone.
•More comfort and control: Compared to the traditional ways that people meet, dating products provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around identifying and reaching out to new people who are interested in connecting. This leads to many people who would otherwise be passive participants in the dating process taking a more active role.
•Safely meet new people: Dating products can offer a safer way to contact new people for the first-time by limiting the amount of personal information exchanged and providing an opportunity to vet a new connection before meeting in person, including via video communication.
•Convenience: The nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time, regardless of where they are.
Depending on a person’s circumstances at any given time, dating products can act as a supplement to, or substitute for, traditional means of meeting people. When selecting a dating product, we believe that users consider the following attributes:
•Brand recognition and scale: Brand is very important. Users generally associate strong dating brands with a higher likelihood of success and more tools to help the user date safely and securely. Generally, successful dating brands depend on large, active communities of users, strong algorithmic filtering technology, and awareness of successful usage among similar users.
•Successful experiences: Demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through word-of-mouth recommendations. Successful experiences also drive repeat usage.
•Community identification: Users typically look for dating products that offer a community or communities with which the user can relate. By selecting a dating product that is focused on a particular demographic, religion, geography, or intent, users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify.
•Product features and user experience: Users tend to gravitate towards dating products that offer features and user experiences that resonate with them, such as question-based matching algorithms, location-based features, or search capabilities. User experience is also driven by the type of user interface (for example, using our patented Swipe® technology versus scrolling), a particular mix of free and paid features, ease of use, privacy, and security. Users expect every interaction with a dating product to be seamless and intuitive.
Given varying consumer preferences, we have adopted a brand portfolio approach, through which we attempt to offer dating products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We believe that this approach maximizes our ability to capture additional users.
Our portfolio
Dating is a highly personal endeavor and consumers have a wide variety of preferences that determine what type of dating product they choose. As a result, our strategy focuses on a portfolio approach of various brands in order to reach a broad range of users. Many of our brands have a long legacy, while others emerged during the time when mobile devices proliferated. The following is a list of our key brands:
Tinder. Tinder, incubated at the Company, was launched in 2012 and has since risen to scale and popularity faster than any other product in the online dating category, growing to over 6.7 million average subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2020. Tinder’s patented Swipe technology has led to significant adoption, particularly among 18 to 30 year-old users, who were previously underserved by the online dating category. Tinder employs a freemium model, through which users are allowed to enjoy many of the core features of Tinder for free, including limited use of the Swipe Right® feature with unlimited communication with other users. However, to enjoy premium features, such as unlimited use of the Swipe Right feature, a Tinder user must subscribe to one of several subscription offerings: Tinder Plus®, launched in early 2015; Tinder Gold™, which was launched in late summer 2017; or Tinder Platinum™, launched in late 2020. Tinder users and subscribers may also pay for certain premium features, such as Super Likes™ and Boosts, on a pay-per-use basis. In 2020, Tinder launched Face to Face, a one-to-one real time video feature allowing users to connect in a new way within the app.
Match. Match was launched in 1995 and helped create the online dating category with the ability to search profiles and receive algorithmic matches. Match remains the most recognized dating app for singles over age 35 
in the United States. In 2020, Match introduced a softer paywall to allow limited free access to messaging and other features before requiring a subscription and also introduced a one-to-one real-time video feature. Additionally, Match offers its subscribers a higher level of service than most of our other brands, including access to date coaching services and profile reviews. Match is a brand that focuses on users with a higher level of intent to enter into a serious relationship and its product and marketing are designed to reinforce that purpose.
Meetic. Meetic, a leading European online dating brand based in France, was launched in 2001. Meetic is the most recognized dating app for singles over age 35 in Europe. Meetic is a brand that focuses on users with a higher level of intent to enter into a serious relationship and its product and marketing are designed to reinforce that purpose. In 2020, Meetic also launched a one-to-one real-time video feature.
OkCupid. OkCupid was launched in 2004 and has attracted users through a Q&A approach to the dating category. OkCupid relies on a freemium model and has a loyal, culturally progressive user base predominately located in larger metropolitan areas in English-speaking markets, with an increasing presence in other global markets such as India and Israel.
Hinge. Hinge was launched in 2012 and has grown to be a popular app for relationship-minded individuals, particularly among the millennial and younger generations, in the United States and the United Kingdom. Hinge is a mobile-only experience and employs a freemium model. Hinge focuses on users with a higher level of intent to enter into a serious relationship and its product is designed to reinforce that purpose.
Pairs. Pairs was launched in 2012 and is a leading provider of dating products in Japan, with a presence in Taiwan and South Korea. Pairs is a dating app that was specifically designed to address social barriers generally associated with the use of dating products in Eastern Asian countries, particularly Japan. 
PlentyOfFish. PlentyOfFish was launched in 2003. Among its distinguishing features is the ability to both search profiles and receive algorithmic matches. PlentyOfFish has grown in popularity over the years and relies on a freemium model. PlentyOfFish has broad appeal in the central United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and a number of other international markets. In 2020, PlentyOfFish launched POF Live™, a one-to-many live streaming video feature that allows users to engage with other users at PlentyOfFish in a new and different format from traditional dating profiles.
OurTime. OurTime is the largest community of singles over age 50 of any dating product. We offer this product in the United States and a number of European markets.
In addition to the brands above, our portfolio includes brands such as Chispa, BLK, and Upward, each of which brings the Swipe feature made popular by Tinder to the Latino, Black, and Christian communities, respectively. Our Hawaya brand focuses on the dating needs of the Muslim community globally by incorporating unique cultural aspects of dating in this community into its product design and feature sets. Ablo is a one-to-one video and text chat product that brings together people from all over the world with real-time translations allowing social discovery across language barriers.
We strive to empower individual brand leaders with the authority and incentives to grow their respective brand. Our brands compete with each other and with third-party dating businesses on brand characteristics, product features, and business model.
We also work to apply a centralized discipline to our portfolio of brands, by sharing best practices across our brands in order to increase growth, reduce costs, improve user safety, and maximize profitability. Additionally, we centralize certain other administrative functions, such as legal, trust and safety, human resources, accounting, finance, and tax. This approach allows us to quickly introduce new products and features, optimize marketing strategies, and more effectively deploy talent across our organization. We attempt to centrally facilitate excellence and efficiency across the entire portfolio by:
•centralizing operational functions across certain brands where we have strength in personnel and sufficient commonality of business interest (for example, ad sales, online marketing, and information technology are centralized across some, but not all, brands);
•developing talent across the portfolio to allow for development of specific proficiencies and promoting career advancement while giving us the ability to deploy the best talent in the most critical positions across the company at any given time; and
•sharing analytics and similar data to leverage product and marketing successes across our businesses rapidly for competitive advantage.
Staying competitive
The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand globally. We compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products. In addition to these other dating brands, we also compete with social media platforms; social-discovery apps; offline dating services, such as in-person matchmakers; and other traditional means of meeting people.
We believe that our ability to attract new users to our brands will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•our ability to continue to increase consumer acceptance and adoption of dating products, particularly in emerging markets and other parts of the world where the associated stigma is only beginning to erode;
•continued growth in internet access and smart phone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets;
•the continued strength of our established brands and the growth of our newer brands;
•the breadth and depth of our active communities of users;
•our brands’ reputation for trust and safety;
•our ability to evolve our products to keep up with user requirements, social trends, and the ever-evolving technological landscape;
•our products’ ability to keep up with the constantly changing regulatory landscape, in particular, as it relates to the regulation of consumer digital media platforms;
•our ability to efficiently acquire new users for our products;
•our ability to continue to optimize our monetization strategies; and
•the design and functionality of our products.
A large portion of dating customers use multiple products over a given period of time, either concurrently or sequentially, making our broad portfolio of brands a competitive advantage.
Where we earn our revenue
All our products enable users to establish a profile and review other users’ profiles without charge. Each product also offers additional features, some of which are free, and some of which require payment depending on the particular product. In general, access to premium features requires a subscription, which is typically offered in packages (primarily ranging from one month to six months), depending on the product and circumstance. Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand depending on the duration of a subscription, the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access, and whether or not a Subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers. In addition to subscriptions, many of our products offer users certain features, such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time, or highlight themselves to a specific user, and these features are offered on a pay-per-use, or à la carte, basis. The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand-by-brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
Our direct revenue is primarily derived from users in the form of recurring subscriptions, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time, and to a lesser extent from à la carte features, where users pay a non-recurring fee for a specific consumable benefit or feature. Each of our brands offers a combination of free and paid features targeted to its own unique community. In addition to direct revenue from our users, we generate indirect revenue from advertising, which makes up a much smaller percentage of our overall revenue as compared to direct revenue.
Dependencies on services provided by others
App Stores
We fully rely on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications and related in-app products. While our mobile applications are generally free to download from these stores, we offer our users the opportunity to purchase subscriptions and certain à la carte features through these applications. We determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold; however, purchases of these subscriptions and features are required in most cases to be processed through the in-app payment systems provided by Apple and Google. Due to these requirements, we pay Apple and Google, as applicable, a meaningful share (generally 30%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions.
Additionally, when our users and subscribers access and pay through the app stores, the platforms may receive personal data about our users and subscribers that we would otherwise receive if we transacted with our users and subscribers directly. The platforms have restricted our access to much of that data.
Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our applications, including the amount of, and requirement to pay, certain fees associated with purchases required to be facilitated by Apple and Google through our applications, and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our applications through their stores, the features we provide, the manner in which we market our in-app products, and our ability to access information about our users and subscribers that they collect. Apple or Google could also make changes to their operating systems or payment services that could negatively impact our business, including by unilaterally raising the prices for those services.
Cloud Services
We rely on third parties, primarily data center service providers and cloud-based, hosted web service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, as well as third party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers, in connection with the provision of our products generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users. We have no control over any of these third parties or their operations.
Problems experienced by third-party data center service providers and cloud-based, hosted web service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, upon which brands including Tinder, Pairs, and Hinge rely, the telecommunications network providers with which we or they contract, or with the systems through which telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their customers could also adversely affect us. Any changes in service levels at our data centers or hosted web service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, or any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products or process transactions with our users, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Sales and marketing 
All of our brands rely on word-of-mouth, or free, user acquisition to varying degrees. Other brands rely on paid user acquisition for a significant percentage of their users. Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing social media advertising, banner, and other display advertising, search engine marketing, email campaigns, video advertising, business development or partnership deals, creating content, and partnering with influencers to promote our products. Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising, out-of-home advertising, and public relations efforts.
Intellectual property 
We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property, as critical to our success.
For example, we rely heavily upon the use of trademarks (primarily Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid, Meetic, OurTime, Pairs, and Hinge, and associated domain names, taglines and logos) to market our products and applications and build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition. We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program, pursuant to which we register our brand names, product names, taglines and 
logos and renew existing trademark and service mark registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions to the extent we determine it to be necessary or otherwise appropriate and cost-effective. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark monitoring policy pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as potential unauthorized use of our material trademarks and service marks. Our enforcement of this policy affords us valuable protection under current laws, rules and regulations. We also reserve and file registrations (to the extent available) and renew existing registrations for domain names that we believe are material to our business.
We also rely upon a combination of in-licensed third-party and proprietary trade secrets, including proprietary algorithms, and upon patented and patent-pending technologies, processes, and features relating to our matching process systems or features, products, and services with expiration dates from 2023 to 2036. We have an ongoing invention recognition program pursuant to which we apply for patents to the extent we determine it to be core to our product or businesses or otherwise appropriate and cost-effective.
We rely on a combination of internal and external controls, including applicable laws, rules and regulations, and contractual restrictions with employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others, to establish, protect and otherwise control access to our various intellectual property rights.
Government regulation 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters that are important to or may otherwise impact our business, including, among others, broadband internet access, online commerce, advertising, user privacy, data protection, intermediary liability, protection of minors, consumer protection, general safety, sex-trafficking, taxation and securities law compliance. As a result, we could be subject to actions based on negligence, regulatory compliance, various torts, and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions. See “Risk factors—Risks relating to our business—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy and platform liability. These laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, declines in user growth or engagement, claims, monetary penalties, or otherwise harm our business” and “—Risks relating to our business—We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.”
Because we receive, store, and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users, we are particularly impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy; the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal data; and data breaches, in many of the countries in which we operate. For example, in 2016, the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Act (which we refer to as “GDPR”), a comprehensive EU privacy and data protection reform that became effective in May 2018. The act applies to companies established in the EU or otherwise providing services or monitoring the behavior of people located in the EU and provides for significant penalties in case of non-compliance as well as a private right of action for individual claimants. GDPR will continue to be interpreted by EU data protection regulators, which have and may in the future require that we make changes to our business practices, and could generate additional costs, risks, and liabilities. The EU is also considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communications (so-called “e-Privacy”) Directive, notably to amend rules on the use of cookies, direct marketing and processing of private communications and related metadata, which may also require that we make changes to our business practices and could generate additional costs, risks and liabilities. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU declared transfers of personal data on the basis of the European Commission’s Privacy Shield Decision illegal and stipulated stricter requirements for the transfer of personal data based on standard contract clauses. This judgement and the resulting decisions and guidelines from EU supervisory authorities may require changes to our business practices and generate additional costs, risks and liabilities. Brexit could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the United Kingdom. At the same time, many countries in which we do business have already adopted or are also currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Multiple legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information have been introduced in the U.S. Congress. Various U.S. state legislatures, including those in New York, Illinois, California, and many other states, are considering privacy legislation in 2021. Other U.S. state 
legislatures have already passed and enacted privacy legislation, most prominently the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was signed into law in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, with full enforcement commencing on June 30, 2020. On November 3, 2020 the “California Privacy Rights Act of 2020” (CPRA) was enacted, which expands the state’s consumer privacy laws and creates a new government organization, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), to enforce the law. The majority of the CPRA’s provisions will enter into force on January 1, 2023, with a lookback to January 2022. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission has increased its focus on privacy and data security practices at digital companies, as evidenced by its levying, in July 2019, of a first-of-its kind, $5 billion fine against Facebook for privacy violations. Finally, talks of a U.S. federal privacy law are ongoing in Congress, with multiple proposals having been made already, and may lead to the passing of a new law in 2021 or the coming years.
Concerns about harms and the use of dating products and social networking platforms for illegal conduct, such as romance scams, promotion of false or inaccurate information, financial fraud, and sex-trafficking, have produced and could continue to produce future legislation or other governmental action. For example, in January 2020, the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy of the U.S. House of Representatives launched an investigation into the online dating industry’s user safety policies, including certain practices of Match Group’s businesses relating to the identification and removal of registered sex offenders and underage individuals from our platforms. The EU and the United Kingdom are also considering new legislation on this topic, with the United Kingdom having released its Online Harms White Paper and the EU introducing the Digital Services Act, which in each case, would expose platforms to similar or more expansive liability. In the United States, government authorities, elected officials, and political candidates have called for amendments to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that would purport to limit or remove protections afforded interactive computer service providers. Proposed legislation includes the EARN IT Act, the PACT Act, the BAD ADS Act, the SAFE TECH Act, and others. If these proposed laws are passed, or if future legislation or governmental action is proposed or taken to address concerns regarding such harms, changes could be required to our products that could restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business generally or cause users to abandon our products. See “Risk factors—Risks relating to our business—Inappropriate actions by certain of our users could be attributed to us and damage our brands’ reputations, which in turn could adversely affect our business.”
Our global businesses are subject to a variety of complex and continuously evolving income and other tax frameworks. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”) is revising its recommendations on how to tax international businesses, including expanding the jurisdiction of member countries to tax businesses based on some level of digital presence and subjecting these companies to a minimum tax. Also, the European Commission, as well as several countries both inside and outside the EU, have recently adopted or considered proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue.
As the provider of dating products with a subscription-based element, we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain U.S. states and other countries that apply to our automatically-renewing subscription payment models. For example, the EU’s Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which became effective in 2018, could impact our ability to process auto-renewal payments or offer promotional or differentiated pricing for users in the EU. Similar legislation or regulation, or changes to existing legislation or regulation governing subscription payments, are being considered in many U.S. states.
Finally, certain U.S. states and certain countries in the Middle East and Asia have laws that specifically govern dating services.
Human talent
Our people are critical to Match Group’s continued success and we work hard to attract, retain and motivate qualified talent. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,880 full-time and approximately 20 part-time employees, which represents a 15% year-over-year increase in employee headcount. We expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions such as software engineers. In addition, we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety and data security initiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth. We may also increase headcount through the completion of 
merger and acquisition transactions, including the acquisition of Hyperconnect, Inc., announced in February 2021, which, pending regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021 and would increase our headcount by approximately 400 employees, based primarily in South Korea. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 68%, 1%, 20%, and 11% of our employees reside in the North America, Latin America, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific regions, respectively, spanning 22 countries and reflecting various cultures, backgrounds, ages, sexes, gender identities, sexual orientations, and ethnicities. Our global workforce is highly educated, with the majority of our employees working in engineering or technical roles that are central to the technological and product innovations that drive our business. Competition for qualified talent has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers and other technical staff.
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative products and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. We work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, and people development. Our goal is to create a culture where everybody, from everywhere and with every background, can contribute, grow, and thrive.
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock-based awards, retirement benefits, healthcare, and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs. We are committed to providing competitive and equitable pay. We base our compensation on market data and conduct evaluations of our compensation practices on a regular basis to determine the competitiveness and fairness of our packages.
We are committed to empowering our people with career advancement and learning opportunities. Our talent development programs provide employees with resources to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and contribute to and, where applicable, lead their organizations.
We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits, career growth opportunities and ways to improve our company’s position as an employer of choice. The results are shared with our employees and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or opportunity and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in employee engagement.
We believe that our approach to talent has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Match Group a desirable destination for current and future employees.

Relationship with IAC after the Separation
In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into certain agreements with IAC to govern the relationship between the Company and IAC following the Separation. These agreements, in certain cases, supersede the agreements entered into between Former Match Group and Former IAC in connection with Former Match Group’s IPO in November 2015 (the “IPO Agreements”) and include: a tax matters agreement; a transition services agreement; and an employee matters agreement. The IPO Agreements that were not superseded were terminated at closing of the Separation.
In addition to the agreements entered into at the time of the Separation, Match Group leases office space to IAC in a building owned by the Company in Los Angeles. Match Group also leases office space from IAC in New York City on a month-to-month basis, which the Company terminated in 2020 and expects to vacate in the first half of 2021.
Tax Matters Agreement
Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, each of Match Group and IAC is responsible for certain tax liabilities and obligations following the transfer by Former IAC (i) to Match Group of certain assets and liabilities of, or related to, the businesses of Former IAC (other than Former Match Group) and (ii) to holders of Former IAC common stock and Former IAC Class B common stock, as a result of the reclassification and mandatory exchange of certain series of Former IAC exchangeable preferred stock (collectively, the “IAC Distribution”). Under the tax matters agreement, IAC generally is responsible for, and has agreed to indemnify Match Group against, any liabilities incurred as a result of the failure of the IAC Distribution to qualify for the intended tax-free treatment unless, subject to certain exceptions, the failure to so qualify is attributable to Match Group's or Former Match Group’s actions or failure to act, Match Group's or Former Match Group’s breach of certain representations or covenants or certain acquisitions of equity securities of Match Group, in each case, described in the tax matters agreement (a "Match Group fault-based action"). If the failure to so qualify is attributable to a Match Group fault-based action, Match Group is responsible for liabilities incurred as a result of such failure and will indemnify IAC against such liabilities so incurred by IAC or its affiliates.
Transition Services Agreement
