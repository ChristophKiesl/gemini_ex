Item 1. Business

We are one of the world’s leading professional services companies, transforming customers’ business, operating and technology models for the digital era. Our unique industry-based, consultative approach helps customers envision, build and run more innovative and efficient businesses. Our core competencies include: business, process, operations and technology consulting, application development and systems integration, enterprise information management, application testing, application maintenance, information technology, or IT, infrastructure services, and business process services. We tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated global delivery model with customer service teams typically based on site at customer locations and delivery teams located at dedicated global delivery centers.
Industry Overview
In today’s complex business environment, many companies face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics, driven by such factors as changes in technology, macroeconomic conditions, and government regulations, globalization and virtualization. Across industries and geographies, companies are looking for innovative ways to adapt their traditional business models, products and services. Technology is now the underpinning force behind new smart products, customer expectations and the proliferation of behavioral data. As a result, businesses are increasingly becoming technology-intensive. These digital technologies represent a new source of value that continues to transform the way companies relate to their customers, engage with employees, and bring innovative products and services to market. In response to these opportunities, many companies are focused on improving efficiencies and enhancing effectiveness while also driving innovation through technology to favorably impact both the bottom-line and the top-line. Many companies are transforming their business, operating and technology models to ensure their businesses stay competitive in this new digital era. At the same time, they continue to view a global sourcing model as an important means to operate more cost-effectively and productively. 
Business Strategy
Our customers seek to meet a dual mandate of achieving more efficient and effective operations, including cost reductions, while investing in digital technologies that are reshaping their business models. Increasingly, the relative emphasis among our customers is shifting towards investment and innovation. We strive to help our customers navigate the shift to digital. Digital services is work we do to help our customers win in the digital economy by applying technology and analytics to change consumer experiences to drive sustainable growth, deploying systems of intelligence to automate and improve core business processes, and improving technology systems by deploying cloud and cyber security solutions and as-a-service models to make them simpler, more modern and secure. 
Our objective is to create value for both our customers and stockholders by enhancing our position as a leading professional services company in the digital era. Our key strategies to achieve this objective are the following:
Align along Three Digital Practice Areas
We are aligning our digital services along three practice areas across our four industry-oriented business segments to address the needs of our customers as they transform their business, operating and technology models. 

• | Cognizant Digital Business. Our digital business practice works with customers to reshape their products and business models, and impacts how organizations interact with their customers, employees and partners. Our approach combines data science, design thinking, and deep industry and process knowledge with solid technology capabilities to unite the physical and virtual aspects of a company’s offerings seamlessly across every channel. We help customers identify insights, develop business models and go-to-market strategies, and design, prototype and scale meaningful experiences.


• | Cognizant Digital Operations. Our digital operations practice helps customers re-engineer, digitize, manage and operate their most essential business processes to lower operating costs, improve user experiences and deliver better outcomes and top-line growth. Across the practice, we are creating automated, data-driven platforms and industry utilities. We help customers develop more effective operating models by applying both traditional optimization levers and helping them achieve process excellence.


• | Cognizant Digital Systems & Technology. Our digital systems and technology practice works with customers to simplify, modernize and secure IT infrastructure and applications by leveraging automation, analytics and agile

development to unlock the power of their technology environments. We help customers create and evolve systems that meet their needs in the modern enterprise by delivering industry-leading standards of performance, cost and flexibility.
Our global consulting team provides business, process, operations and technology consulting services to bring together the capabilities of all three of our digital practice areas into effective solutions for our customers. Our Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, professionals and domain experts from our industry-focused business segments work closely with our digital practice areas to create frameworks, platforms and solutions that customers are finding valuable as they pursue next-level savings and new revenue streams.
Scale Our Digital Practice Areas
We are investing to scale our digital practice areas across our business segments and geographies. We seek to drive organic growth through extensive training and re-skilling of our existing technical teams and expansion of our local workforces in the United States and other local markets around the world where we operate. Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and alliances that can expand our intellectual property, industry expertise, geographic reach, and platform and technology capabilities. 
In 2016, we completed several business combinations that we expect to contribute to our digital service capabilities. These transactions included the acquisition of KBACE Technologies, Inc., a global consulting and technology services company that strengthens and expands our digital capabilities to deliver cloud-based application services, the acquisition of Idea Couture, a global consulting company that offers digital innovation, strategy, design and technology services, the acquisition of Mirabeau BV, a digital marketing and customer experience agency that expands our digital business capabilities across Europe, and the acquisition of Adaptra, an Australia-based consulting, business transformation and technology services provider in the insurance industry. Additionally, in April 2016, we acquired a 49% ownership interest in ReD Associates, a strategic consulting firm specializing in the use of human sciences to help business leaders better understand customer behavior.
Continue Development of Our Core Business
Our core business is an important foundation that supports our ability to provide digital services to our customers. In many cases, our customers' new digital systems are built upon the backbone of their core, traditional systems. Our deep knowledge of our customers' core systems can provide us with a significant advantage as we work with our customers to build new digital capabilities. 
Our services include consulting and technology services and outsourcing services and are delivered to our customers across our four business segments in a standardized, high-quality manner through our global delivery model. Consulting and technology services include business, process, operations and technology consulting, application development and systems integrations, application testing, enterprise information management and software solutions and related services. Outsourcing services include application maintenance, IT infrastructure services and business process services. 
Customers often look for efficiencies in the running of their core operations to help them fund investments in new digital capabilities. We work with them to analyze and identify opportunities for advanced automation and delivery efficiencies. We deploy a variety of commercial and delivery models, including managed services, fixed bid, output and outcome based pricing and platforms to address the varied needs of our customers. 
Additionally, we seek to expand the geographic reach of our core portfolio of services. We believe that Europe, the Middle East, the Asia Pacific region and Latin America will continue to be areas of significant investments for us as we see these regions as long term growth opportunities.
Domain Expertise 
Our deep domain expertise in the industries we serve is central to our ability to understand our customers' challenges and design effective solutions to address them. We hire professionals with in-depth industry experience and continually invest in industry training for our staff and build out industry-specific services and solutions. This approach is key to our high levels of on-time delivery and customer satisfaction.
Global Delivery Model
We utilize a global delivery model, with delivery centers worldwide, to provide high quality services and responsiveness to our customers at competitive rates. We have a four-tiered global architecture for service delivery and operations, consisting of employees co-located at customers’ sites, at local or in-country delivery centers, at regional delivery centers and at offshore delivery centers. As we develop our digital services, we are focused on hiring in the United States and other countries to expand 
2

our in-country delivery capabilities. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure facilitates the seamless integration of our global workforce.
Customer Centric Approach
We put our customer’s priorities first and continuously seek to deliver what the customer needs by thinking beyond what the customer asks and providing smart and innovative solutions. A cornerstone of our success is the interconnectivity of our associates and teams across segments and practice areas. We believe that when we share knowledge and work together, we can achieve more for our customers and ourselves.
Business Segments
We are organized around and report the operations of our business according to our four industry-oriented business segments as shown below. This industry focus has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction. As the technology services industry continues to mature and shift from supporting the business to becoming one of the main sources of value, customers are requiring service providers with a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, customers, markets and cultures who can create solutions tailored to meet their customers’ individual business needs. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the distribution of our revenues across our four industry-oriented business segments were as follows:

Financial Services | Healthcare | Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics | Other 
-Banking-Insurance | -Healthcare-Life Sciences | -Manufacturing and Logistics-Retail, Travel and Hospitality-Consumer Goods | -Communications-Information, Media and Entertainment-High Technology

See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our business segments, including the disclosure of segment operating profit and financial information by geographic area.
Financial Services

• | Banking. We serve traditional retail and commercial banks, diversified financial enterprises, broker-dealers, asset management firms, depositories, clearing organizations and exchanges. We assist these customers in such areas as retail banking, wholesale banking, consumer lending, cards and payments, risk management, investment banking and brokerage, asset and wealth management, and securities services. The demand for our services in the banking sector is being driven by significant changes in the industry, which are leading customers to search for new areas of growth while addressing cost and profitability pressures and regulatory changes. In addition, financial institutions are adopting new digital technologies to change the way they interface with customers and employees and manage their operations.


• | Insurance. We serve global property and casualty insurers, life insurers, reinsurance firms and insurance brokers. We focus on such aspects of our customers’ operations as business acquisition, policy administration, claims processing, management reporting, regulatory compliance and reinsurance. One of the factors driving the need for our services in the insurance industry is our customers' desire to improve the sales and marketing process, both by deepening direct retail customer relationships and strengthening interactions with networks of independent and captive insurance agents, often through the use of digital technologies. Insurers also seek to enhance their profitability by differentiating their products and services, resulting in a need for specialized underwriting models and systems. Additionally, many

3

insurers seek to improve business effectiveness by reducing expense ratios and exiting non-core lines of business and operations.
Healthcare

• | Healthcare. We serve many leading global healthcare organizations, including healthcare payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers. The healthcare industry is facing the dual challenge of improving the quality of care while lowering the cost of care. Our Healthcare business focuses on providing a broad range of services and solutions that address regulatory requirements and emerging industry trends such as regulatory compliance, integrated health management, enterprise information management, claims investigative services and operational improvement in areas such as claims processing, enrollment, membership and billing. We also help our customers to enable their systems and processes to deal with the retail orientation of healthcare, such as the support of individual mandates, the adoption of digital solutions to improve access to health information, decision making by end consumers and collaboration among payers, providers and patients. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products for the healthcare industry.


• | Life Sciences. We serve leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device companies, as well as providers of generic, animal health and consumer health products. Some of the factors driving demand for our services are financial pressures caused by payer and government pricing pressures, patent expiry and competition from generics, the drive to expand into new geographic markets, the need for more targeted or personalized therapies leading to research and development innovation, continued diversification of product portfolios and the related high cost of product development, and a dynamic regulatory environment with greater emphasis on product safety, ethics and compliance, transparency of pricing and promotional activity. Our life sciences solutions help transform many of the business processes in the life sciences value chain (research, clinical development, manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing) as well as regulatory and administrative functions. Life sciences companies around the world are focusing on improving digital engagement with all of their stakeholders while increasingly leveraging enterprise-level analytics to drive a customer-centric approach to marketing and sales.

Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics

• | Manufacturing and Logistics. Customers in this sector include manufacturers of automotive and industrial products as well as processors of natural resources, chemicals and raw materials. In logistics, our customers include rail, truck, marine and other transportation and distribution companies. We also serve many leading energy utilities, as well as oil and gas producers. Some of our manufacturing and logistics solutions for automotive and industrial customers include warranty management, dealer systems integration, supply chain management, sales and operations planning, and mobility. For transportation and distribution customers, our service areas include warehouse and yard management, transportation asset management, transportation network design, global trade management and analytics. Industry trends that influence the demand for our services in this sector include the increasing globalization of sourcing and the desire of customers to further penetrate emerging markets, leading to longer and more complex supply chains. Customers are optimizing their supply chains to better manage inventory, support growing ecommerce operations and improve customer-supplier collaboration. They are applying intelligent systems to manufacturing and logistics operations, enabling mobile platforms to support field sales, are using data analytics to make better informed decisions and making smart, connected products that are a portal to an ecosystem of data and services.


• | Retail, Travel and Hospitality. We serve a wide spectrum of retailers and distributors, including supermarkets, specialty premium retailers, department stores and large mass-merchandise discounters. Current trends affecting demand in the retail industry include the impact of digital technologies on customer and employee interaction, a need for greater cost-efficiency to combat the industry’s traditionally narrow profit margins, changes in supply chain management to facilitate direct store delivery and the ability to accommodate multi-channel (in-store and on-line) models. We also serve the travel and hospitality industry, including airlines, hotels, restaurants, online and retail travel, rental car companies, global distribution systems and intermediaries and real estate companies.


• | Consumer Goods. We serve many of the world’s premier consumer goods manufacturers, creating innovative solutions and strategies that help them build and sustain strong brands while enhancing their price-competitiveness, category leadership and consumer loyalty. Principal segments include consumer durables, food and beverage, footwear and apparel, and home and personal care products. Our expertise in these areas includes demand-driven supply chains, revenue-creating trade promotion management systems, analytics systems and mobility solutions that anticipate and serve ever-changing customer needs. The demand for our services in this sector is driven by the need of consumer goods companies to accelerate product innovation to remain competitive and deliver top-line growth, the continuing drive to optimize global sourcing and supply chain management, the impact of digital technologies on consumer

4

interaction, marketing and sales processes, the use of data analytics to increase the effectiveness of product development and marketing, as well as ongoing pressures to curtail technology costs.
Beginning with 2017, we will discuss our Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics business segment in terms of four operating segments: Retail and Consumer Goods, Manufacturing and Logistics, Travel and Hospitality and Energy and Utilities. 
Other
The Other business segment is an aggregation of operating segments each of which, individually, represents less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. Descriptions of the key operating segments included in the Other business segment are as follows:

• | Communications. We serve some of the world’s leading communications (cable, wireless and wireline) service providers, equipment vendors, and software vendors. We help our customers address the important trends in the communications industry, such as transitioning to new network technologies, designing, developing, testing and introducing new products and channels, improving customer service and increasing customer satisfaction, transforming business support systems and operations support systems, transitioning to agile development methodologies and enabling applications for cloud deployment. We use digital and cloud-based technologies to modernize the customers’ products and customer experience.


• | Information, Media and Entertainment. We serve some of the world’s largest media and entertainment companies, including information service providers, publishers, broadcasters, and movie, music and video game companies. The growth of digital platforms is causing significant change in these industries and we are working with customers to help them meet these challenges and transform their businesses. Trends affecting the industry include a decline in traditional print publishing, the need for digital asset management and the increasing role of digital technologies on the consumption of entertainment content. We provide solutions in critical areas such as the digital content supply chain and media asset management. Some of our other services include business solutions, such as advertising management, online media, and e-business, digital distribution, workflow automation, intellectual property management, anti-piracy initiatives and operational systems (advertising sales, studio management, billing and payments, content management and delivery).


• | High Technology. We serve some of the world’s leading independent software vendors, technology equipment manufacturers, social network companies and online service providers. We assist these companies with their transitions to new digital business models and facilitate their license management and sales processes. We help the high-technology manufacturers take on complex, transformational business process and product engineering initiatives. The technology sector is largely driven by product development. This creates demand for analytical, engineering, testing, and content management services and go-to-market strategies.

Beginning with 2017, we will discuss our Other business segment in terms of three operating segments - Communications and Media, Technology and Other.
Across our business segments, we are highly dependent upon our foreign operations. Our global delivery centers and technical professionals are positioned globally, with the majority located in India. Our operations in India and the rest of the world expose us to various risks, including regulatory, economic and political instability, potentially unfavorable tax, import and export policies, fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international and civil hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics.
Our Solutions and Services
Across each of our business segments, we continually invest in the expansion of our service portfolio to anticipate and meet customers’ evolving needs. These service areas, consulting and technology services and outsourcing services, are delivered to our customers across our four business segments in a standardized, high-quality manner through our global delivery model. Our three digital practice areas span our portfolio of service offerings. Our current service areas include:
Consulting and Technology Services

• | Business, Process, Operations and Consulting. Our global consulting team, CBC, helps customers re-imagine and transform their businesses to gain competitive advantage. CBC works with customers to improve business performance and operational productivity in order to exceed business goals.

• | Application Development and Systems Integration. We offer a full range of application design, application development and systems integration services, which ensures that customer technology functions operate in the most efficient, responsive and cost-effective manner. We have particular depth of skills in implementing large, complex, business-critical technology development and integration programs.

Our quality engineering and assurance transformation services help customers develop deep, agile capabilities that create or extend their competitive advantage. Our business-aligned services in the areas of system and integration testing, package testing, user acceptance, automation, performance testing and test data management address our customers’ critical quality needs. Consulting and infrastructure solutions in quality management, test tools and test infrastructure enable our customers to capitalize on emerging opportunities.


• | Enterprise Information Management. Our enterprise information management practice focuses on helping customers harness the vast amounts of data available on their operations, customers and markets, and convert that data into information and insights that are valuable to their businesses and can be used to drive management decisions. We help customers identify the types of data available both within their organizations and from outside sources and work to bring that data together in a meaningful “data to foresight” continuum. Among the trends driving this business are the desire of companies to better understand consumer demands and market opportunities in order to create new products and services, the need to manage reporting requirements in regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services, and the pressures to manage operations more efficiently and cost-effectively through the use of analytical tools.


• | Software solutions and related services. We develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products for the healthcare industry, including solutions for health insurance plans, third party benefit administrators, or TPAs, and healthcare providers that enable healthcare organizations to work more efficiently and collaboratively to deliver better healthcare services. Our solutions help health plans and TPAs increase administrative efficiency, improve the cost and quality of care, and succeed in the retail healthcare market. Our solutions help physicians and healthcare organizations simplify business processes and execute strategies for population health management, accountable care, and value-based initiatives.

Outsourcing Services

• | Application maintenance. Our application maintenance service offering supports some or all of a customer’s applications, ensuring that systems remain operational and responsive to changing user requirements and provide on-going enhancements as required by the customer. Beyond the traditional view of technology outsourcing as a cost-saving measure, our application maintenance services enable customers to improve the overall agility, responsiveness, productivity and efficiency of their IT infrastructure. Increasingly, we are also assisting customers in adapting their IT systems to digital technologies. As part of this process, we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and on-going support. We also provide application value management solutions that can help balance cost, complexity and capacity and can help customers reduce cost of ownership, improve service levels and create new operational efficiencies. Our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and cost-effective support services to our customers. Our on-site personnel often provide help-desk services at the customer’s facility. As part of our application maintenance services, we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations, new standards or other external events. We anticipate the operational environment of our customers’ IT systems as we design and develop such systems. We also offer diagnostic services to assist customers in identifying issues in their IT systems and optimizing the performance of their systems.


• | IT infrastructure services. We provide IT Infrastructure management outsourcing services and have service capability in redundant global operating centers worldwide, through which we provide significant scale, quality and cost savings to our customers. Customers are increasingly utilizing IT infrastructure services to sharpen their focus on core business operations, reallocate overhead costs to growth investments, enable businesses to respond more quickly to changing demands, decrease time to market, ensure that the IT infrastructure can scale as the business evolves and access skill sets outside the organization. The major services we provide include data center, infrastructure security, network and convergence, end-user computing services and mobility. We also have cloud services offerings that utilize virtualization technologies across delivery solutions for private cloud, enterprise multi-tenant cloud and public cloud models. We provide services that harness and modernize legacy systems to be digital-ready with agility and speed without sacrificing the knowledge those systems contain.

• | Business process services. We provide business process services through unique industry-aligned solutions that integrate process, domain and technology expertise to enable our customers to respond in an agile manner to market opportunities and challenges, while also creating variable cost structures to drive greater effectiveness and cost-efficiency. We have extensive domain-specific expertise in core front office, middle office and back office functions including finance and accounting, procurement, data administration, data management, and research and analytics. Our industry-specific solutions include clinical data management, pharmacovigilance, equity research support, commercial operations and order management. In addition to business process services, related services include consulting to ensure process excellence and a range of platform-based services. Our goals for our customer relationships are customer satisfaction, operational productivity, strategic value and business transformation. Among the factors driving growth in our services are the desire to improve cost-effectiveness, the emergence of digital technologies, and the need for customers to access capabilities beyond their organizations to adapt to rapid changes in technologies, markets and customer demands.

Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our global headquarters and business development offices, which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world. The sales and marketing group works with our customer delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider. The duration of the sales process may vary widely depending on the type and complexity of services.
Customers
The number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years. As of December 31, 2016, we increased the number of strategic customers to 329. We define a strategic customer as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. Revenues from our top customers were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Revenues from top five customers as a percentage of total revenues | 10.0 | % | | 11.0 | % | 12.2 | %
Revenues from top ten customers as a percentage of total revenues | 16.7 | % | | 18.6 | % | 21.3 | %

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the distribution of our revenues across geographies was as follows:
