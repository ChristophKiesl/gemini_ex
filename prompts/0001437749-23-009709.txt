Item 1.  Business
Corporate Overview
 
Orbital Infrastructure Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (Nasdaq: OIG), formerly known as Orbital Energy Group, Inc. and CUI Global Inc., are collectively referred to as ‘‘Orbital Infrastructure Group,’’ the “Company,” or “OIG.” Orbital Infrastructure Group is a Texas corporation organized on April 21, 1998 with its principal place of business located at 5444 Westheimer Road, Suite 1650, Houston, Texas 77056. The Company is a diversified infrastructure services company serving customers in the electric power, telecommunications, and renewable markets.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company's continuing operations were reclassified into three reportable segments, which include the Electric Power segment, the Telecommunications segment, and the Renewables segment. The Company’s corporate overhead activities are included in Other. Orbital Infrastructure Group has continuing operations in four countries, including the United States, Australia, Belgium and India.
 
In December 2021, the Company announced plans to exit its Integrated Energy Infrastructure Solutions and Services segment. Both the domestic portion of the segment, Orbital Gas Systems, North America, and the foreign segment, Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (Orbital-UK) were held for sale as of December 31, 2021, and considered discontinued operations.
 

Electric Power Segment
 
The Electric Power segment consists of Front Line Power Construction, LLC based in Houston, Texas and Orbital Power, Inc. based in Dallas, Texas. The segment provides comprehensive infrastructure solutions to customers in the electric power industry. Services performed by Front Line Power and Orbital Power, Inc. generally include but are not limited to the engineering, design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure and substation facilities as well as emergency restoration services.

Discontinued Operations - Integrated Energy Infrastructure Solutions and Services
 
On December 28, 2021, the Board of Directors of Orbital Infrastructure Group, Inc. approved management’s recommendation for certain restructuring and cost reduction actions to strategically reposition the Company’s business. This strategy focused on building an infrastructure services company serving the electric power, telecommunications and renewable markets by disposing of two (2) of its subsidiaries.  The two subsidiaries were:
● Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. (“OGSNA”);
 
● Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (“Orbital UK”).
 
OGSNA and Orbital UK are collectively referred to as the “Orbital Gas Subsidiaries."
 
The Orbital Gas Subsidiaries provide proprietary gas measurement and sampling technologies and the integration of process control and measuring/sampling systems. These legacy businesses did not fit within the Company's future strategy to build an infrastructure services company serving the electric power, telecommunications, and renewable markets. The disposition of the Orbital Gas Subsidiaries facilitated the Company’s restructuring and cost savings initiatives and were intended to realign and simplify its business structure and better position the Company for future growth and improved profitability.
 
Following is a description of the businesses included in discontinued operations.
 
Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. (Orbital-UK) was based in Stone, Staffordshire in the United Kingdom and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. (Orbital North America), was based in Houston, Texas. The Integrated Energy Infrastructure Solutions and Services segment subsidiaries are providers of gas solutions, with more than 30 years of experience in design, installation and the commissioning of industrial gas sampling, measurement and delivery systems. Included in the U.K. is a 46,000 square foot manufacturing/administration/research and development facility. Orbital Gas Systems manufactures and delivers integrated engineering solutions and technologies including environmental monitoring, gas metering, process control, telemetry, gas sampling and BioMethane to grid solutions. 
 
Under the United States Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, and the system of international registration of trademarks governed by international treaties, the Madrid Agreement, which maintains the international register and, in several instances, direct trademark registration in foreign countries, our discontinued operations maintain up to date the following trademarks: GasPT, IRIS, Orbital Gas Systems, and VE Technology.
 
As of December 31, 2021, Orbital UK was considered held for sale and its assets were written down to their expected sale price, resulting in a $9.2 million impairment in 2021. The sale of the U.K. operations closed in May of 2022. The Company could receive additional consideration if certain events transpire during the 12-month restricted period following the settlement date.  
 
The Company sold a portion of the North America business in the third quarter of 2022 at approximately book value of the assets sold. Certain assets and liabilities not sold with the business were reclassified from held for sale to held and used. Remaining assets held for sale at December 31, 2022 include the VE Technology asset of the Company's North America Orbital Gas subsidiary. VE Technology is a gas sampling intellectual property, which provides a method of penetrating the gas flow without the associated vortex vibration, thereby making it a ‘‘stand-alone’’ product for thermal sensing (thermowells) and trace-element sampling.
 
In addition to the discontinued operations held for sale, the Company's assets held for sale also included $1.4 million of assets from Eclipse Foundation Group, which was integrated into the Front Line Power Construction, LLC in the third quarter of 2022.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, Orbital Infrastructure Group, Inc., with its consolidated subsidiaries, had 1,490 employees in continuing operations and 3 employees in discontinued operations. This is an increase in total employees from the 1329 total employees reported as of December 31, 2021 in continuing operations and 111 employees in discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2022, 190 of its employees are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or IBEW, which is a slight decrease from 203 IBEW members as of December 31, 2021. The increase in employees relates to the growth at IMMCO and GTS and the addition of Coax Fiber Solutions in 2022 partially offset by a decrease in headcount at the other entities. The Company values all of its employees and fosters a good working relationship. As the company continues to increase revenues, additional staff may be added to adequately support the business.
Intellectual Property Protection
 The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products, logos and services. These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners. The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.
 
Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, and the system of international registration of trademarks governed by international treaties, the Madrid Agreement, which maintains the international register and, in several instances, direct trademark registration in foreign countries, we and our subsidiaries actively maintain up to date the following trademarks for continuing operations: Orbital Power, Inc. and IMMCO, Inc.
 
The Company continuously reviews and updates the existing intellectual property filings and files new documentation both nationally and internationally (Patent Cooperation Treaty) in a continuing effort to maintain up-to-date protection of its intellectual property.
 
For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could cause the Company’s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and highly competitive wherein Orbital Infrastructure Group competes with other contractors, from small local independent companies to large national firms, in most of the geographic markets in which we operate. Several competitors are large companies that have significant financial, technical and marketing resources. Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate such as technical expertise, high safety rating requirements, operational experience and quality, and financial resources. From time to time, new competitors that have adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor in our markets. A significant portion of our revenues is currently derived from unit price or fixed price agreements with price often a primary factor in customer project awards; therefore, we could be underbid by our competitors. We believe that as demand for our services increases, customers often consider other factors in choosing a service provider, including technical expertise and experience, safety ratings, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation and dependability, which we expect to benefit larger contractors such as us. There can be no assurance, however, that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Many of our customers are able to perform their own infrastructure services similar to the work we provide. Although these companies currently outsource a significant portion of these services, there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future or that they will not acquire additional in-house capabilities.
