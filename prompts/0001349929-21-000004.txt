Pending Merger with StemoniX
The Company, CGI Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGI (“Merger Sub”), and StemoniX, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“StemoniX”), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge (the “merger”) with and into StemoniX, with StemoniX surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CGI following the merger. It is expected that the shareholders of StemoniX will become the majority owners of CGI’s outstanding common stock upon the closing of the merger. The Company has filed an effective registration statement on Form S-4, as amended, dated February 12, 2021, as supplemented by a proxy supplement filed on February 26, 2021, describing StemoniX and the terms of the Merger Agreement. The merger with StemoniX is subject to certain closing conditions including listing by Nasdaq, and no assurance can be given that the closing conditions will be satisfied or that the merger with StemoniX will occur.
StemoniX develops and manufactures human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based neural, cardiac and pancreatic screening platforms for drug discovery and development. Engineered from human skin and blood cells, iPSCs are made with in-licensed patented processes discovered by 2012 Nobel Prize recipient Dr. Shinya Yamanaka. StemoniX’s iPSC innovations are made from living human cells and have organ-like, or organoid, characteristics; referred to as microOrgans®. StemoniX has industrialized these microOrgans into standard multi-well plate formats that are sufficiently robust and reproducible to enable drug screening and optimization activities.
StemoniX combines its microOrgan platform with software analytics and augmented intelligence, referred to as AnalytiX™. StemoniX’s integrated approach provides a compelling value proposition to pharmaceutical companies and other entities because StemoniX enables standardized, high-throughput screening of drug candidates on complex human organoids prior to human clinical studies, mitigating or in some cases avoiding the inadequacies of testing in clonal cell lines or rodents. StemoniX and its customers and collaborators believe that StemoniX’s technologies will permit drug discovery in human disease areas that are difficult to address using current methodologies, accelerate preclinical drug discovery and development, reduce risk of clinical failure, predict with greater degrees of confidence and ultimately, reduce the cost of discovering new therapeutic agents.
StemoniX’s business model combines both collaborations with integrated pharmaceutical companies on the derivation and subsequent supply of iPSC-based disease models and screens, and internal drug discovery efforts to identify drug candidates for licensure or clinical development. In StemoniX’s disease model effort, StemoniX creates novel models per the specifications of its partners, then either sells microOrgan plates to them or performs Discovery as a Service (“DaaS”) on their behalf in its facilities. StemoniX strives to receive a mixture of upfront payments, including licensing fees, milestone-based fees, and ongoing royalty payments in addition to any charges for microOrgan plates and services. While the revenue from StemoniX’s disease model and screening activities represents an important component of its business, StemoniX’s long-term strategy is to leverage its iPSC technology to pursue partnered and wholly-owned drug discovery projects that yield higher value assets. In its current drug discovery efforts, StemoniX typically collaborates with a partner by pooling its expertise in iPSC biology and screening analytics with the partner’s medicinal chemistry capabilities.
StemoniX was incorporated in 2014 in Minnesota with headquarters in Maple Grove, Minnesota, and a research and development team located in La Jolla, California. StemoniX focuses on new iPSC differential protocols, plating procedures, and expansion techniques. StemoniX’s Maple Grove manufacturing facility focuses on the growth, differentiation, plating, and shipping of its microOrgan platforms in a highly standardized and rigorous process. The Maple Grove facility includes clean-room and biohazard safe environments to house its incubators, biological safety cabinets, liquid handling machines, refrigerators, and office space. Both facilities also have diagnostic equipment for quality control and assurance. The majority of StemoniX’s DaaS revenue is generated from its Maple Grove facility.
StemoniX is a development stage company, and it had net losses of $8.7 million (unaudited) and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Historical Business and Key Strategic Divestitures
The Company was founded in 1999 to conduct critical research and development of innovative diagnostic tests for the benefit of helping physicians treat complicated cancer cases for patients with blood-borne disease. Upon becoming a publicly-traded company through an initial public offering in 2013, the Company completed a series of acquisitions which expanded the footprint of the business globally, and enlarged the Company’s capabilities to offer unique diagnostic tests and services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and extended the Company’s development and patient care expertise to solid tumor cancers. Until the consummation of the Business Disposals (as defined below) in July 2019, the Company was focused on enabling precision medicine in oncology by providing multi-disciplinary diagnostic and data solutions, facilitating individualized therapies through the Company’s diagnostic tests, services and molecular markers.
The Company utilized relatively the same proprietary and nonproprietary diagnostic tests, laboratory developed tests (LDTs) and technologies across all of its service offerings to deliver results-oriented information important to cancer treatment and patient management. The Company’s portfolio primarily included comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarrays, gene expression tests, next generation sequencing (NGS) panels, and DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. The Company provided testing services from its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) - certified and College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) - accredited laboratories in Rutherford, NJ and Morrisville, NC.
siParadigm, Inc.
On July 5, 2019, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Clinical Agreement”) by and among the Company and siParadigm, LLC (“siParadigm”), pursuant to which the Company sold to siParadigm certain assets associated with the Company’s clinical laboratory business (the “Clinical Business,” and such assets, the “Designated Assets”) and agreed to cease operating the Clinical Business. The Designated Assets include intellectual property, equipment and customer lists associated with the Clinical Business, and for a period the Company was providing certain transitional services to siParadigm pursuant to the Clinical Agreement. The cash consideration paid by siParadigm at closing was approximately $747 thousand, which included a $1.0 million advance payment of an earn out, less adjustments and costs of approximately $253 thousand. The Clinical Business sale (together with the BioPharma Disposal, the “Business Disposals”) was completed on July 8, 2019.

The Company’s customers are increasingly attracted to working with it on preclinical development of biomarker detection methods, response to immuno-oncology directed novel treatments and early prediction of clinical outcomes which is supported by its extended portfolio of orthotopic, xenografts and syngeneic tumor test systems as a unique service offering in the immuno-oncology space.
Strategy
The Company’s market strategy is to focus on developing innovative new drug discoveries in partnership with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and governmental research facilities. The Company’s current Discovery Services include preclinical anti-tumor efficacy, GLP compliant toxicity studies and small and bio-molecule analytical services, and the Company provides the tools and testing methods for companies and researchers seeking to identify and to develop new compounds and molecular-based biomarkers for diagnostics and therapeutics. With the proposed merger with StemoniX, the Company will be able to extend its capabilities to include standardized, high-throughput screening of drug candidates on complex human organoids prior to human clinical studies, to de-risk translational decision making and accelerate the time it takes to identify both novel and repurposed compounds and bring relevant data to investigational new drug applications before regulatory agencies around the globe. By combining StemoniX’ microOrgan platform with software analytics and augmented intelligence, referred to as AnalytiX™, StemoniX’s integrated approach provides a compelling value proposition to pharmaceutical companies and for the combined companies own discovery programs.
The Company currently offers preclinical services such as predictive tumor models, human orthotopic xenografts and syngeneic immuno-oncology relevant tumor models in its Hershey, PA facility and continues to work toward being a leader in the field of immuno-oncology preclinical services in the United States. This service is supplemented with GLP toxicology and extended bioanalytical services in its Australian-based facilities in Clayton, VIC and Gilles Plains, SA.
In 2019, until the Business Disposals, the Company utilized relatively the same proprietary and nonproprietary molecular diagnostic tests and technologies across all of its service offerings outside of Discovery Services to deliver results-oriented information important to cancer treatment and patient management.
Market Overview
United States Clinical Oncology Market Overview
Despite many advances in the treatment of cancer, it remains one of the greatest areas of unmet medical need. In 2019, the World Health Organization attributed 9.6 million deaths globally to cancer, which is about 1 in 6 deaths. Within the United States, cancer is the second most common cause of death, exceeded only by heart disease, accounting for nearly one out of every four deaths. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimated that the direct medical treatment costs of cancer in the United States for 2015 were $80.2 billion. The incidence, deaths and economic loss caused by cancer are staggering. In the United States in 2020, it is expected that in total there will be approximately 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed, which is the equivalent of approximately 4,950 new cases each day, according to the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) 2019 data. Although overall cancer death rates continue to decline, incidence rates are leveling off among males and are increasing slightly among females. These trends reflect population changes in cancer risk factors, screening test use, diagnostic practices, and treatment advances. Many cancers can be prevented or treated effectively if they are found early. Population-based cancer incidence and mortality data can be used to inform efforts to decrease the cancer burden in the United States and regularly monitor progress toward goals. 
United States and International Clinical Trials Market Overview
The global clinical trials market size is expected to reach USD $69.8 billion by 2027, exhibiting a 5.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the forecast period, according to a February 2020 report published by Grand View Research, Inc. The United States is currently a world leader in biopharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing. In Fiscal Year 2020, the National Cancer Institute received a budget of $6.44 billion, an increase of $297 million over FY 2019, to issue grants to support research, with a targeted investment in enhanced and early detection of disease through the analysis of circulating biomarkers using minimally invasive methods, as well as a focused investment in cancer prevention and treatment including research on new vaccines to prevent cancer-causing infections and investigational immuno-oncology drugs and drug combinations. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) reports that the average cost to develop a drug, including trial failures can be as high as $2.6 billion and the approval process from development to market may be as long as 15 years. According to the National Cancer Institute, since the 1990s, cancer death rates in the United States have declined 23%, and approximately 83% of life expectancy increases in cancer patients are due to new treatments and oncology medications.
Outside of the United States, growth in the pharmaceuticals and clinical trials market is continuing, and trials are increasingly becoming more complex. Growth in the European pharma market is anticipated to be driven largely by the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France and Italy. The size of this market is expected to grow 25% between 2017 and 2022, accounting for nearly 70% of the European pharma market by 2022.
While oncology drugs have the potential to be among the most personalized therapeutics, very few successfully make it to market. The application of pharmacogenomics to oncology clinical trials enables researchers to better predict differences, initially driven by data derived in preclinical research. The Company believes a growing demand for faster development of personalized medicines and more effective clinical trials are growth drivers of this market, and its core expertise is preclinical efficacy, toxicity and bioanalytical services.
More specific to the Company’s targeted markets around the world, according to Market Insight Reports (October 2019) the global oncology-based in-vivo CRO market was valued at over $799 million in 2018 and is projected to reach $1.47 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 7.9% from 2019 to 2026. The major factors contributing to the growth of this market include the rising incidence of cancer cases worldwide, the rise in the geriatric population, the increasing number of specific therapies in the oncology pipeline and the presence of large numbers of pipeline drugs. The number of late-stage pipeline therapies rose from 711 in 2017 to 849 in 2018, representing an increase of 19%, and the use of oncology-based in-vivo CRO helps in deriving the novel therapies for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment to patients. Oncology is one of the most studied indication areas, as per the statistics available from government agencies around the world. Other factors that are playing a key role in driving growth in the oncology-based in-vivo CRO business include greater federal funding for research studies and increasing research expertise in the industry.
The Company has a particularly strong set of experiences working in the preclinical area of checkpoint inhibitors and specifically immunotherapies. Drug development is continuing to attract biotech companies transforming scientific innovation into practice-changing cancer drugs, thereby driving demand for the Company’s services. When considering druggable targets within the different immuno-oncology drug classes, T cell immunomodulators and cell therapies had the largest increase in new targets in the past 2 years, which suggests that more innovation is going into these drug classes than the other IO drug classes. According to Nature Reviews December 2019, active drugs in development have grown from 2,030 to 3,876, a 91% increase in just two years, resulting in more than 3,400 active clinical trials evaluating such agents, 66% of all active immuno-oncology drugs in development.
The Company's Strategy
With the Business Disposal transactions completed in 2019, the Company embarked on a transformative strategy to focus on drug discovery and introducing an innovative approach toward biotechnology, from target identification to Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. Since entering into the Merger Agreement with StemoniX, if consummated, the Company intends to collaborate with industry partners to offer a unique, multiple modality approach to incorporate in silico, in vitro and in vivo derived data while combining deep biology and data science. The Company expects to partner with biotech and pharmaceutical drug developers in neurology, cardiac and oncology to provide licensed access to our technology platforms.

By reimagining drug discovery, the Company is focused on playing a pivotal role in providing better treatments to patients faster by maximizing the time and resources of researchers and medical scientists. The Company expects to realize synergies from the merger by taking a human-first approach to discovery through the convergence of biology, chemistry and data analytics. StemoniX functional models, deep scientific expertise, and advanced analytical algorithms converge to provide the right biology, effective workflows, and actionable results that move our partners forward and get medications to patients faster. Human spheroids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) create highly functional and standardized screening for high-throughput data outputs that are predictive of viable target compounds to de-risk and accelerate decision making for biopharma partners and the Company’s own pipeline of therapeutics later in 2021.
The Company is currently focused on delivering its pre-clinical CRO and drug discovery services to a diverse group of market participants, including:
•biotechnology companies;
•pharmaceutical companies;
•governmental agencies; and
•academic research centers.
These participants require syngeneic and xenograft tumor models to support the development of novel biomarkers and increasing technological expertise to collect key data sets for their clinical trials, understand and manage therapeutic development and design customized therapy choices. The Company believes that its approach to rapidly translate research insights about the genetics and molecular mechanisms of cancer into the research community will lead to innovative products 
being developed, particularly in the area of immuno-oncology therapies. To achieve this, and in order of its focus and priority, the Company intends to:
•Leverage its specialized, disease-focused genomic and molecular knowledge, insights and service portfolio to secure additional collaborations or partnerships with leading biotech and pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations through its vivoPharm business. This will deepen its relationships with its existing clients and expand its unique portfolio of Discovery Service offerings in the United States, Europe, Australia and the rest of the world. Biotech and Pharmaceutical companies engaged in the identification of therapeutic targets and novel oncology and immuno-oncology treatments often require support in trial design, assay development, preclinical research and clinical research and trial management. vivoPharm’s suite of oncology-focused services, including proprietary tumor models, enables the Company to increase its market share in drug identification, drug rescue and drug repurposing studies. The Company believes vivoPharm’s capabilities provide it with opportunities to deepen its relationships with existing customers through additional discovery and downstream molecular work.
•Leverage its growing preclinical business to influence sales relationships with its former biopharma business in the U.S., Europe and Australia, to provide its integrated service offerings. The Company believes that by combining the efforts of its business development teams inside of its existing and prospective Discovery clients, which entail many biopharma companies, the Company can leverage its capabilities from preclinical development of biomarker detection methods, responses to immuno-oncology directed novel treatments and early prediction of clinical outcomes, supported by its extended portfolio of orthotopic, xenografts and syngeneic tumor test systems, to help drive its access to support other translational oncology initiatives. 
•Continue its focus on translational oncology and drive innovation and cost efficiency in drug discovery by continuing to develop unique offerings independently and through collaborations with academic and cancer research centers and other key opinion leaders and their organizations. Translational oncology refers to the focus of bringing novel research insights that characterize cancer treatments to predict clinical outcomes with the overall goal of improving value to patients in the treatment and management of disease. The Company believes that continuing to develop its existing platforms and tumor models will enable growth and efficiencies within its business. 
•Engage key strategic partners in the U.S. and abroad to leverage its remaining intellectual property portfolio and unique capabilities to grow its revenue. The Company entered into a strategic partnership in China to license its Tissue of Origin® test in that region and the Company intends to monetize this asset in 2021 through the sale to a Chinese or U.S. based diagnostic laboratory.
•Continue to aggressively manage its cost structure. The Company continues to focus on managing its operating costs while continuing to seek additional revenue growth opportunities. The Company is implementing measures to streamline costs across its laboratory facilities, and integrating administrative functions across its global operations, along with key financial enterprise resource planning and human resource systems that enable greater efficiency.
The Company believes that the pending merger with StemoniX, if consummated, will be beneficial in furthering the business of the Company for a number of reasons:
•The Company believes that the merger will position the post-merger company to harness the synergies between two critical modalities of drug discovery and development - advanced animal models and relevant human high-throughput organoid platforms;
•The Company believes in the scientific and clinical value of the StemoniX business and that the resulting integration of scientific and technology-based expertise, skilled management teams, and ability to offer customers an end-to-end platform will de-risk and accelerate discovery and development of preclinical and clinical pipelines for biopharma partners as well as for the proprietary pipeline of the post-merger company;
•The Company believes that the post-merger company will be able to create partnership engagements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that will yield significant revenue opportunities, based on the combined technology and scientific expertise to the combined professional staff;
•The Company believes that the resulting integration of scientific capabilities from the merger provides the best opportunity to improve upon CGI’s cash position and historic substantial doubt about CGI’s ability to continue as a going concern; and
•The Company expects that the post-merger company will include experienced members from the senior management team of StemoniX who have expertise in drug discovery that is valued by potential pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners.

Solid Tissue Cancers
The term “solid tumors” encompasses abnormal masses of cells that do not include fluid areas (e.g. blood) or cysts. Solid tumors are composed of abnormal cell growths that originate in organs or soft tissue and are normally named after the types of cells that form them. Examples of solid tumors include breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and melanoma. Solid tumors may be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and may spread from their primary tissue of origin to other locations in the body (metastasis). There are over 200 individual chemotherapeutic drugs available for combating solid tumor cancers. Selection of an appropriate course of treatment for a patient may depend on identification of the gene mutation or mutations present in their particular cancer and on determining the cancer’s tissue of origin. Metastatic tumors with an uncertain primary site can be a difficult clinical problem. In tens of thousands of oncology patients every year, no confident diagnosis is ever issued, making standard-of-care treatment impossible.
The Company’s Proprietary Tests for Solid Tissue Cancers

Tissue of Origin® Test. The Company continues to own and maintain its FDA-cleared Tissue of Origin® test, or TOO®, a gene expression test that is indicated when there is clinical uncertainty about a poorly differentiated or undifferentiated, or a metastatic tumor where the primary tissue of cancer development is unknown. The Tissue of Origin® test the Company believes is currently the only FDA-cleared test of its kind on the market, and can determine the most likely tissue of origin of a patient tumor sample from the fifteen most common tumor types - including thyroid, breast, pancreas, colon, ovarian and prostate - which account for ninety percent of all incidences of solid tissue tumors, by measuring the expression levels of 2,000 individual genes. TOO® is supported by extensive analytical and clinical validation data from robust, multi-center clinical studies. The Company believes TOO® can reduce the need for repeated testing, examinations, imaging and biopsy procedures by providing clinicians with the primary tissue type with greater certainty than traditional diagnostic techniques. This in turn empowers physicians to select the correct type of treatment earlier in the course of the patient’s therapy. The Company is holding the patent for sale.

These services included: biorepository, clinical trial logistics, clinical trial design, bioinformatics analysis, customized assay development. DNA and RNA extraction and purification, genotyping, gene expression and biomarker analyses. The Company also sought to apply its expertise in laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) to assist in developing and commercializing drug-specific companion diagnostics. The Company established business relationships with key instrument manufacturers to support their platforms in the market, and to drive acceptance among biopharmaceutical sponsors developing innovative immuno-oncology therapies.
In addition to the tests and services the Company provided to biotech and pharmaceutical companies, the Company developed Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels focused on pharmacogenomics and oncology that will inform researchers of trial subjects’ drug sensitivities.
The Company also utilized its laboratories to provide clinical trial services to biotech and pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations to improve the efficiency and economic viability of clinical trials. The Company’s clinical trials services leveraged its knowledge of clinical oncology and molecular diagnostics and its laboratories’ fully integrated capabilities.
From a laboratory infrastructure standpoint, the Company possessed capabilities in histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, cytogenetics and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), as well as sophisticated molecular analysis techniques, including next generation sequencing. This allowed for comprehensive esoteric testing within one lab enterprise, with a CAP-accredited biorepository serving as a central hub for specimen tracking. Using this approach, the Company was able to support demanding clinical trial protocols requiring multiple assays and techniques aimed at capturing data on multiple biomarkers. The Company’s suite of available testing platforms allowed for highly customized clinical trial design which was supported by a dedicated group of development scientists and technical personnel.
The Company also provided genetic testing for drug metabolism to aid biotech and pharmaceutical companies identify subjects’ likely responses to treatment, allowing these companies to conduct more efficient and safer clinical trials. The Company believes pharmacogenomics drug metabolism testing helps deliver the promise of personalized medicine by enabling researchers to tailor therapies in development to differences in patients’ genomic profiles.
Clinical Services
Until the Business Disposals, the Company provided its oncology and immuno-oncology tests and services to oncologists and pathologists at hospitals, cancer centers, and physician offices. The Company’s portfolio contains proprietary tests to target cancers that are difficult to prognose and predict treatment outcomes through currently available mainstream techniques. The Company utilized an expansive range of non-proprietary tests and technologies to provide a comprehensive profile for each patient it serves. Clinical testing was available through anatomic pathology, flow cytometry, karotype, FISH, liquid biopsy and molecular diagnostics (including next generation sequencing and gene expression panels).
Sales and Marketing
The Company’s sales and marketing efforts consist of both direct and indirect efforts, with the majority of efforts focused on direct sales in the United States, Europe and Australia. The Company collaborates with preclinical development and translational science teams at pharmaceutical and biotech companies on studies involving tumor models and therapeutic candidate compound testing.
The Company’s U.S. and European business development and sales professionals have scientific backgrounds in hematology, pathology, and laboratory services, with many years of experience in biopharmaceutical and clinical oncology sales, esoteric laboratory sales from leading biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical or specialty reference laboratory companies. The Company currently has a team of four business development and sales professionals in the United States and Europe.
The Company also promotes its services through marketing channels commonly used by the biopharma and pharmaceutical industries, such as internet, medical meetings and broad-based publication of its scientific and economic data. In addition, the Company provides easy-to-access information to its customers over the internet through dedicated websites. The Company’s customers value easily accessible information in order to quickly review patient or study information.
Competition
(US), MD Biosciences (US)., IQVIA (US), PAREXEL International Corporation (US), Envigo (US), Charles River (US), ICON PLC (Dublin), PRA Health Sciences (US), Medpace (US), Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (US), WuXi AppTec (China) and Eurofins Scientific (Luxembourg). The players operating in the global preclinical CRO market are focusing on product unveilings, along with intensifying their global presence by entering untouched markets.
Projects related to the molecular mechanisms driving cancer development have received increased government funding, both in the United States and internationally. The National Cancer Institutes’ Cancer Moonshot is anticipated to increase both patient awareness and federal government funding for research and clinical trials. The Federal Government has committed $1.8 billion over a 7-year period to fund the 21st Century Cures Act. As more information regarding cancer genomics and biomarkers becomes available to the public, the Company anticipates that more products aimed at identifying targeted treatment options will be developed and that these products may compete with its products.
Third-Party Suppliers
The Company currently relies on third-party suppliers for its specialized research and scientific instrumentation and related supplies of reagents, tumor cell lines, and other inventory for it to successfully perform its CRO services for its customers. In addition, the Company relies on contracted manufacturers and collaborative partners to produce materials necessary for its FHACT® and FDA-cleared Tissue of Origin® tests. The Company plans to continue to rely on these manufacturers and collaborative partners to manufacture these materials. The Company does not believe a short-term disruption from any one of these suppliers would have a material effect on its business, nor has the Company experienced any disruptions due to COVID-19.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
The Company has proprietary tests that enable oncologists and pathologists at hospitals, cancer centers, and physician offices to properly diagnose and inform cancer treatment. The Company relies on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, as well as various contractual arrangements, in order to protect the proprietary aspects of its technology. The Company may also license its technology to others. The Company believes that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to its business as a whole.
Until the Business Disposals, the Company’s patent portfolio consisted of 20 issued U.S. patents, 5 pending U.S. applications, and more than 40 foreign patents. Most of this intellectual property was transferred to those parties the Company entered into to complete the Business Disposals. The Company’s key remaining patents currently include:
•Hematological cancers. The Company has two U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,580,713 and 8,557,747), directed to MatBA®, a microarray for detecting (and distinguishing) particular types of mature B cell neoplasms present in typical non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These patents cover the Company’s trademarked MatBA® microarray and are directed to both the microarray itself as well as associated methodologies designed to detect the particular type of mature B cell neoplasm present in a patient. The MatBA® microarray patents issued from the first of the Company’s family of applications in the microarray space. The term of these patents runs through 2030.
•The Company has four U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,977,506, 8,321,137, 7,747,547 and 8,473,217) covering its Tissue of Origin® Test. These patents are directed at systems and methods for detecting biological features in solid tumors. The term of these patents run through 2030.
•HPV-Associated Cancers. The Company has three U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,157,129, 8,865,882 and 8,883,414) that cover methods for detecting HPV-associated cancers used in its FHACT® test. The term of these patents run through 2031.
•FISH Probes. The Company has two patents covering its FISH probes. These patents cover probes and methodologies designed to detect and analyze particular chromosomal translocations (genetic lesions) associated with a wide range of cancers using a technique known as FISH and serve as the backbone for several of its other pending patent applications, which are more specifically geared towards other probes (and methodologies). The term of these patents run through 2022.
Until the Business Disposals, the Company held twenty-six U.S. registered trademarks, including a federal registration for the term “CGI” as well as three U.S. trademark applications and one foreign trademark registration for certain of its proprietary tests and services. The Company transferred the ownership of these trademarks to the Buyer, subject to a royalty-free license to 
use such intellectual property for six months after following the closing, and subject to its right to request an additional six months, which request has been made. The Company also owns the trademark for the vivoPharm trade name, which is the primary revenue-generating business unit.
Operations and Production Facilities
As a preclinical oncology contract research organization (CRO), the Company's leased facilities are built to house immunocompromised animals and specialized models. They incorporate surgical suites, gowning rooms, and holding rooms. In order to ensure an environment of utmost sterility, while also minimizing the workload by negating dependency on cage-wash infrastructure, the Company relies on its landlords and licensors to manage the vivarium’s at its animal facilities. This allows for more investment of time and energy into scientific endeavors. 
Quality Assurance
We are committed to maintaining a standard of excellence and to providing reliable and accurate laboratory services to our customers. To that goal, our independent Quality Assurance Unit (QAU) has implemented a comprehensive and integrated Quality Management System (QMS) designed to drive consistent high quality testing services while ensuring the highest ethical standards across our enterprise.
Our QMS documents quality assurance policies as well as the quality control procedures that are necessary to ensure we offer a consistently high quality of testing services. Our quality management program is designed to satisfy all the requirements necessary for local, state, and federal regulations in order to maintain licensures, permits and regulatory approvals applicable to our business. In addition, our QMS satisfies the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for nonclinical studies conduct and content, computer systems validation, electronic records and signatures, and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). For additional information on our laboratory licensure and permitting, please review our Risk Factors.
Quality indicators, which are metrics related to ensuring accurate and reliable test results, are routinely tracked at each of our facilities and are compared to previously determined benchmarks. These indicators are reviewed periodically by our scientific management team and include key performance indicators, non-conformance indicators (deviations, corrective and preventives actions), proficiency testing reports, and customer satisfaction surveys. We leverage third-party provided proficiency testing whenever practicable to provide objective analysis of our QMS and procedures, and we implement internal review protocols for assays for which third-party proficiency testing is not available.
Our facilities and QMS are audited internally on a periodic basis for compliance with applicable regulations, policies, analytical plans and internal standard operating procedures. Any needed revisions to the QMS that are identified through these audits are made to ensure continued compliance with applicable standards, and we believe that we meet State and Federal regulations in the geographies where we operate. 
Customer satisfaction is another key to successful implementation of our QMS. We routinely monitor customer input and complaints, and take necessary actions to assure their satisfaction. Our management team encourages employees to communicate any concerns they may have with respect to scientific misconduct, quality and safety.
In addition to maintaining a robust QMS, we have defined a plan that covers a wide range of disaster recovery and business continuity issues including data recovery. Both the business continuity and disaster recovery plans are reviewed on an annual basis.
Governmental Regulations
The Company’s Pennsylvania and Australia research laboratory facilities comply with Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) to the extent required by the FDA, Environmental Protection Agency, USDA, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as other international regulatory agencies. Furthermore, the Company’s early-stage discovery work, which is not subject to GLP standards, is typically carried out under a quality management system or internally developed quality systems. The Company’s facilities are regularly inspected by U.S. and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities, its clients’ quality assurance departments, and its own internal quality assessment program. The Company is also accredited by AAALAC International, a private, nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. The Company volunteers to participate in the AAALAC’s program to demonstrate its commitment to responsible animal care and use, in addition to its compliance with local, state and federal laws that regulate animal research.
FDA
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the sale or distribution, in interstate commerce, of medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), including in vitro diagnostic test kits, reagents and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. Certain of such devices must undergo premarket review by FDA prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute or pursuant to FDA’s exercise of enforcement discretion. FDA, to date, has not exercised its authority to actively regulate the development and use of LDTs, such as the Company’s, as medical devices and therefore the Company does not believe that its LDTs currently require premarket clearance or approval.
Post-market Regulation
The Company's Tissue of Origin® test obtained clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. After a device, such as its Tissue of Origin® test, is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply once the test is marketed, including FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements. Since the Company does not offer its FDA-approved product in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) the Company is not currently subject to post-market regulation in the EEA or any member state. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a company has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•reconsideration of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export approvals for products; and/or
•criminal prosecution.
In addition, FDA could publicly issue a safety notice related to the Company's test or request updates to its product labeling, including the addition of warnings, precautions, or contraindications.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”)
Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations which establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the privacy and security of Protected Health Information used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities. For further discussion of HIPAA and the impact on the Company's business, see the section entitled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to its Business-The Company is required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information that require significant compliance costs, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.”
European General Data Protection Regulation
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union had previously been governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, which has been replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GRPR”) which became effective on May 25, 2018 While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate the Company's clinical trial activities in EU members states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European 
Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or € 20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, the Company may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules.
The Company's research activities in the EU are currently limited to non-human preclinical studies, and as such, the Company does not collect, store, maintain, process, or transmit any Personal Data (as that term is defined under the GDPR) of trial subjects. However, since the Company currently has three employees located in the EU, its processing and transfer for employee Personal Data is subject to GDPR requirements. The Company has implemented a privacy and security program that is designed to adhere to the requirements of the GDPR in order to protect employee Personal Data, and in the event the Company progresses to research or clinical trials involving humans, to protect participant Personal Data. However, there is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance be onerous and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As a result, the Company cannot predict the impact of the GDPR regulations on its current or future business, either in the US or the EU. 
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under a governmental payor program. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the Department of Health and Human Services has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti- Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. For further discussion of the impact of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations on the Company’s business, see the section entitled “Risk ."
Additionally, in Europe various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the new Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
Other Regulatory Requirements
The Company’s laboratory is subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples and other human tissue. Typically, the Company uses outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.
OSHA has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.
