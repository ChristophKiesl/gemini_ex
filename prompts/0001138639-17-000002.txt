ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Overview
Infinera Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “Infinera”) provides optical transport networking equipment, software and services to telecommunications service providers, internet content providers (“ICPs”), cable providers, wholesale and enterprise carriers, research and education institutions, enterprise customers, and government entities across the globe. Optical transport networks are deployed by customers facing significant demand for optical bandwidth prompted by increased use of high-speed internet access, mobile broadband, cloud-based services, high-definition video streaming services, virtual and augmented reality, the Internet of Things (IoT) and business Ethernet services. 
Infinera is a leader in large-scale photonic integrated circuits (“PICs”), which is a key component inside many of our Intelligent Transport Network platforms. Infinera’s PIC technology optimizes the manufacturing process by using indium phosphide with which it is possible to fabricate all of the necessary optical functions on a single semiconductor chip. The Infinera Intelligent Transport Network architecture is highly scalable, flexible and open, which enables us to leverage our core competency of vertically integrated technologies. Our third-generation PICs, commercially available since 2012, transmit and receive 500 gigabits per second (“Gb/s”), and incorporate over 600 discrete optical functions into a pair of PICs. Our PICs, combined with our FlexCoherent digital signal processors (“DSPs”), increase the capacity-reach performance of our products to deliver coherent optical transmission. Similar to how silicon integrated circuits changed the dynamics of the computing industry by increasing computing performance and reliability while reducing physical size, power consumption and heat dissipation, we believe our PICs change the dynamics of the optical transport network industry by increasing optical performance and reliability while reducing physical size, power consumption and heat dissipation. 
In 2016, we announced the Infinite Capacity Engine (ICE), our next-generation technology, which delivers a family of multi-terabit opto-electronic subsystems powered by our fourth-generation PIC and next-generation FlexCoherent DSP. The Infinite Capacity Engine is a family of different subsystems that can be customized for different network applications across our product portfolio, spanning the long-haul, subsea, datacenter interconnect (“DCI”) and metro markets. 
Traditionally, we have focused on the long-haul portion of the optical transport market and a large portion of our revenue continues to be derived from long-haul and subsea customers. Over the past two years, we have significantly increased the number of products we offer, evolving from focusing entirely on the long-haul and subsea markets with the DTN-X Family of products to offering an end-to-end suite of solutions that spans terrestrial long-haul, subsea, DCI, and metro core and access.
In late 2014, we increased our addressable markets by introducing the Cloud Xpress platform for the DCI market. Since the initial introduction of the Cloud Xpress with 40 Gigabit Ethernet (“GbE”) client interfaces, we have enhanced our position by expanding our Cloud Xpress Family to also offer 10 GbE and 100 GbE client interfaces to meet customer-specific requirements. Our next-generation Cloud Xpress solution, due to be released during 2017, further optimizes space and power, and delivers 1.2 terabits per second (“Tb/s”) of capacity in a one rack unit (“RU”) box without the need for external multiplexers or amplifiers for distances up to 130km.
In the second half of 2015, we entered the metro market with the acquisition of Transmode AB (“Transmode”), a leader in metro packet-optical applications, based in Stockholm, Sweden. With our entrance into DCI and metro markets over the last few years, we are now able to provide our customers with an end-to-end portfolio of solutions. The XTM Series and XTG Series are designed to address the metro market, with 100 Gb/s metro core/regional transport capabilities and packet-optical solutions optimized for fast-growing applications in the access portion of the network, including mobile fronthaul and backhaul, triple-play and cable broadband aggregation, and business Ethernet services with Metro Ethernet Forum (“MEF”) certification. These products are complemented by the XTC-2 product designed for high-capacity handoffs of traffic from a long-haul network.
Our end-to-end packet-optical portfolio is designed to be managed with a single network management system. In addition to offering our traditional management system for wavelength-division multiplexing (“WDM”) operations, we also provide solutions for enabling programmability of our Intelligent Transport Networks with our Digital Network Administrator (“DNA”), network management system (“NMS”) and software-defined networking (“SDN”) via the Xceed Software Suite (“Xceed”). Our multi-layer SDN platform enables customers to write software applications that leverage the scalability, flexibility and openness of our Intelligent Transport Networks to deliver innovative services while efficiently using their network resources.

We believe that our portfolio of purpose-built products benefits our customers by providing a unique combination of highly scalable capacity and features that address various applications and ultimately simplify and automate transport network operations. 
We were incorporated in December 2000 and originally operated under the name “Zepton Networks.” We are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 140 Caspian Court, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. Our telephone number is (408) 572-5200. “Infinera,” “Infinera DTN,” “Infinera DTN-X,” “ATN,” “Infinera Intelligent Transport Network,” “FlexCoherent,” “Infinera FlexILS,” “Infinera Instant Bandwidth” and “Infinera FastSMP” are trademarks or service marks of Infinera Corporation in the United States, certain other countries and/or the European Union. Any other trademarks or trade names mentioned are the property of their respective owners.
Industry Background
Optical transport networking equipment carries digital information using light waves over fiber optic cables. With the advent of WDM systems, data is transmitted by using multiple wavelengths of light using different frequencies or colors over a single optical fiber. Customers deploy WDM systems to carry information between continents, across countries, between cities and within metropolitan areas, and in some cases all the way to the end user. Fiber optic networks are generally capable of carrying most types of communications traffic. We believe that a number of trends in the communications industry are driving demand for network bandwidth and ultimately will increase demand for optical transport networking systems. These trends include: 

• | growth of cloud services;


• | growth of bandwidth-intensive services like streaming high-definition video services;


• | increasing use of connected virtual and augmented reality devices;


• | proliferation of mobile services of Wi-Fi, 4G and future growth of 5G; and


• | rise of the Internet of Things, driving massive growth in the number of network-connected devices.

As network traffic grows, customers add transmission bandwidth to existing optical networks or purchase and deploy additional systems to address bandwidth demands and offer expanded services to their respective customers. In particular, consumers and businesses increasingly rely on the cloud for their application needs across compute, storage and network functions. Today many applications have transformed from function-specific deployments on dedicated hardware platforms to virtualized services implemented on generic hardware within cloud data centers. This transformation is leading to the creation of a simplified model of Layer C (cloud services) supported by the underlying Layer T (intelligent transport). As cloud adoption increases, large network operators are reporting a magnification effect on incoming traffic, such that a single request from an end-user can generate many times the amount of traffic between data centers as compared to the amount of traffic contained in the original request. This server-to-server traffic is also called east-west traffic, and this magnification effect is accelerating the deployment of high-bandwidth optical transport solutions to support cloud network infrastructures. 
We believe that our customers seek the following solutions in order to increase their revenue and/or expand their service offerings:

• | high-bandwidth solutions that scale optical transmission bandwidth to meet increasing demand while providing wide-ranging granularity for service efficiency;


• | efficient solutions with the right mix of integrated and disaggregated systems that optimize performance and increase reliability while reducing physical space, power consumption and heat dissipation, leading to lower operational expenses;


• | easy-to-use solutions that are highly programmable and open, which help reduce the time and complexity of deploying new transmission bandwidth;


• | improved integration between packet or Internet Protocol equipment such as routers and optical transport networking equipment; and


• | strong encryption at the transport layer processed at line-rate speeds.

We believe that the Infinera Intelligent Transport Network architecture is uniquely enabled to deliver improvements in these areas compared to competitive WDM systems. We also believe that our Intelligent Transport Networks enable our customers to deploy scalable, flexible and open solutions that simplify and automate optical network operations.

Strategy
Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of optical transport networking systems to our customers around the world. Key aspects of our strategy to achieve this goal include:

• | Proliferating our broad base of purpose-built technologies and products to existing customers, as well as obtain new customers. We have introduced multiple purpose-built products to allow us to address a broader portion of our existing customer networks but also to expand into adjacent markets.


• | Enhancing our existing product portfolio for the long-haul, subsea, DCI and metro markets. We are enhancing existing products and building new products across long-haul, subsea, DCI and metro aggregation markets. We anticipate that these products will be released over the course of 2017 with a focus on advanced features and further integration to improve our cost structure.


• | Improving the cadence under which new products are brought to market. Historically, we have brought new generations of our products based on our optical engine, which includes advanced PICs and DSPs, to market every four to five years. Current competitive market conditions include increased investments from our larger competitors that allows for faster cadences of new products. In addition, the emergence of certain component providers who build enhanced components have allowed other competitors to bring products to market much faster than they could have in the past. As a result, we have committed to bring new generations of our products to market approximately every two to three years.


• | Continuing our commitment to provide world-class product quality and support services to our customers. We believe that providing the most reliable products and our customer experience capabilities are major differentiators. Our global customer service and technical support team is committed to making our customers successful by providing the highest quality support services to deploy, operate and maintain their networks.


• | Maintaining and extending our technology lead. We intend to continually invest in key technologies such as various forms of the PIC, our FlexCoherent processor, application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”), software and other important technologies. We plan to incorporate the functionality of additional discrete functions into our PICs and take advantage of the advanced features in our new DSPs. In addition, we intend to pursue the expansion of our packet switching and bandwidth management capabilities in order to enhance the performance, scalability and economic advantages of our products.


• | Continuing investment in vertically integrated manufacturing activities. We believe that our vertical integration and manufacturing capabilities serve as competitive advantages from a technology, supply chain and financial perspective, and we plan to continue to invest in our next-generation PIC technologies. We will supplement that strategy through the use of certain merchant components in certain cases where it can provide us with a performance, cost or time-to-market advantage.


• | Investing in our network management system and SDN. We believe that we lead the industry in ease of use, facilitated through our Infinera Management System and Xceed suite of software products. We continue to invest in our software products, including adding capabilities such as Infinera Instant Bandwidth. We are extending the management and control capabilities across our entire portfolio with a goal of achieving end-to-end service provisioning. Based on customers’ desire for more programmable networks, we have added open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) to our Infinera Intelligent Transport Network architecture so they can be used by our customers to build more agile networks and deliver competitive services.

Customers
Our customer verticals include:

• | Tier-1 carriers for domestic and international networks;


• | Tier-2 and Tier-3 carriers;


• | ICP and data center operators;


• | wholesale carriers;


• | submarine network operators;


• | multiple system operators/cable companies;


• | enterprise customers; and


• | research and education/government entities.

3

We sell our products both directly to customers who are end users, and to channel partners that sell on our behalf. We believe one of our strengths is the diversity of our customer base as we generate annual revenues from each of the verticals listed above, and have multiple customers within each vertical that have historically spent significantly on our solutions. We do not have long-term sales commitments from our customers. One customer accounted for over 10% of our revenue in 2016. Revenue from this customer accounted for 16% of our revenue in 2016. Two customers each accounted for over 10% of our revenue in 2015. These two customers accounted for 17% and 13%, respectively, of our revenue in 2015. One customer accounted for over 10% of our revenue in 2014. Revenue from this customer accounted for 19% of our revenue in 2014. 
Technology
Infinera Intelligent Transport Network Architecture
We were founded with a vision of enabling an infinite pool of intelligent bandwidth upon which the next communications infrastructure is built upon. We have focused our efforts, time and capital on developing application-optimized platforms based on our Infinera Intelligent Transport Network architecture, which enables customers to create rich end-user experiences based on efficient, high-bandwidth transport by combining the following elements:

• | Scalable. The proliferation of data centers, rise of cloud computing, increasing consumption of video and growth in mobile access is fundamentally changing traffic characteristics in operator networks. Infinera Intelligent Transport Networks deliver multi-terabit coherent super-channels today. This technology allows a massive pool of bandwidth to be provisioned in a single operational motion. We expect to introduce products in the course of 2017 that will utilize our new Infinite Capacity Engine and deliver sliceable super-channels up to 2.4 Tb/s. Sliceable photonics provide wavelength granularity for wide-ranging control of the network.


• | Flexible. Networks are growing in complexity with the proliferation of internet protocols, network layers and fiber interconnects. Complexity increases the time it takes to plan and deploy network services and increases the cost of maintenance, operation, power, space and cooling. By combining packet and Optical Transport Network (“OTN”) switching functions with WDM, integrated platforms offer a wide variety of services. Conversely, disaggregated platforms offer optimized functionality that prioritizes lowering overall network operating costs without compromising performance. Infinera Intelligent Transport Networks offer a mix of integrated and disaggregated platforms to reduce complexity in the network.


• | Open. Network operators are facing intensifying competition to meet customer demand for immediate bandwidth needs and better visibility into the network. Our Intelligent Transport Networks feature highly programmable platforms with SDN APIs enabling networks to be open; this helps simplify end to end multi-layer provisioning. Additionally, there is growing demand from certain customers for line systems that are open, which entails having the ability to use transponders from one vendor over a different vendor’s line system. We are addressing this dynamic, both by seeking opportunities to sell our transponders over other vendors’ line systems and also offering an Infinera platform that supports both fixed and flexible grid technology, thus allowing a seamless mix of multi-vendor transponders.

Infinera Photonic Integrated Circuits
We believe that our custom-built PICs and FlexCoherent processors, part of the Infinite Capacity Engine, are key components of our value proposition and a competitive advantage. We manufacture and package our PICs at our own facilities for use exclusively with our Infinera DTN, DTN-X Family and Cloud Xpress Family platforms. Our PICs are purpose-built for diverse network locations and applications. As a leader in photonic integration, we have protected the intellectual property associated with our PIC manufacturing through a combination of trade secrets, patents and contractual protections. We believe that as a result of the combination of the multiple disciplines that were required to develop our PIC, together with the intellectual property protections that we have established, it will be difficult for others to duplicate the technology we have developed. We believe that large-scale photonic integration using indium phosphide enables significantly improved manufacturing economics for optical networking, allowing future optical transport cost reductions to be viably sustained on a cost curve defined by volume manufacturing efficiencies, greater functional integration and increased device density.
Infinera FlexCoherent Processor
Optical transmission is based on a number of technologies, namely: phase modulation, polarization multiplexing, coherent detection and advanced digital signal processing. These “coherent technologies” are used by network operators to enable higher data capacities to be transmitted over their existing optical fiber infrastructure, typically using the same or better design rules than those used for the previous generation. We have integrated advanced coherent technologies onto our FlexCoherent DSP, such as cutting-edge Nyquist subcarriers and soft-decision forward error correction gain sharing techniques. The processor works in conjunction with our large-scale 
4

PICs based on advanced photonics to construct the Infinite Capacity Engine for exceptional optical transport performance.
Super-Channels
The Infinera DTN-X Family of products and the Cloud Xpress Family are designed to support multiple channels of 100 Gb/s capacity in a single line card or unit depending on the platform form factor. This pool of bandwidth is managed as a single super-channel, up to 500 Gb/s that can be deployed in a single operational motion. In 2017, we expect to release products that will allow channels of up to 200 Gb/s and up to 2.4 Tb/s super channels. In order to achieve the same system capacity, competitive solutions would require the installation of discrete line modules or units, which in some cases could number as many as 10, each turned up with its own operational motion. Super-channels result in competitive advantages in the areas of space and power consumption, leading to lower operational costs and long-term system reliability, as well as significant reductions in time to install and repair.
Sliceable Photonics
Our soon to be released platforms are designed to provide up to 2.4 Tb/s of capacity in a single module with a single fiber pair using the Infinite Capacity Engine, while being able to slice the 2.4 Tb/s capacity into a 100 Gb/s wavelength or 100 Gb/s increments. Each increment can be tuned and routed in multiple separate directions, with each fully tuned to its own flexible grid frequency as well as having its own coherent modulation profile. This significantly reduces requirements for modules in networks, resulting in lower total cost of ownership and a highly flexible optical transport network. This solution simplifies traffic aggregation while providing 100 Gb/s economics at multi-terabit scale. It contrasts with competitive solutions that are being built without sliceable photonics technology and in which granularity gets progressively reduced as bandwidth increases, resulting in more fibers, more power consumption and more rack space.
Disaggregation
The Infinera Intelligent Transport Network is a mix of disaggregated and integrated platforms. Disaggregated platforms are optimized for certain applications that need point-to-point or point-to-multipoint interconnects. As a result, they are low-power compact units that are server-like and adopt the rack-and-stack operational model. The Infinera Cloud Xpress provides a point-to-point DCI solution and was the first small form factor platform in its category. We have also announced DTN-X XT Series meshponders, which are designed to leverage the Infinite Capacity Engine, combining muxponder technology with sliceable photonics in a server-like WDM appliance to deliver multi-terabit capacities along with fine-grained granularity for optical mesh networks. These meshponders are expected to be released over the course of 2017.
Integrated Digital Switching
Our unique PIC technology allows the Infinera DTN-X XTC Series platforms to fully integrate WDM transport and OTN switching capabilities in a single platform, without compromising overall system functionality or capacity. The integrated OTN switching capability along with generalized multi-protocol label switching automation allows customers to deploy Infinera FastSMP (Fast Shared Mesh Protection), a standards-based resiliency technique for networks to recover from local and network-wide multiple failures without the need to dedicate backup bandwidth for every active circuit. We implement this technology using a purpose-built hardware acceleration chip included in every single card of the Infinera DTN-X XTC Series platform, ensuring a sub-50 milliseconds recovery.
Infinera Instant Bandwidth
Infinera Instant Bandwidth enables customers to license a super-channel pool of bandwidth in 100 Gb/s increments. With Infinera Instant Bandwidth technology, which is available with the Infinera DTN-X XTC Series, DTN-X XT Series and Cloud Xpress platforms, customers can provision an additional 100 Gb/s of transmission capacity on demand without the deployment of any incremental equipment. The Infinera Instant Bandwidth technology is uniquely enabled by our super-channel capability and PICs, providing customers the ability to adopt a success-based business model for network growth. This technology has been extended to include a time-based capability offering network bandwidth in 100 Gb/s increments for a certain duration.
Infinera Packet-Optical Transport
Our packet-optical technologies included in both the Infinera DTN-X XTC Series and the XTM Series platforms offer the right amount of packet and optical switching integrated into efficient packet-optical platforms. This enables customers to support Ethernet and multi-protocol label switching (“MPLS”) packet transport, aggregation and service functions directly within the optical WDM layer. Operators can build highly efficient router interconnects and bandwidth engineering capabilities within the transport layer, without having to send the traffic to the router layer for transit. Our Intelligent Transport Networks not only enhance network efficiency but also provide scalable bandwidth and performance for revenue-yielding MEF-certified Carrier Ethernet and MPLS packet services.
5

Multi-layer Switching and Optimization
The Intelligent Transport Network combines coherent super-channels, WDM switching, non-blocking OTN switching and packet switching in a unified architecture for comprehensive flexibility. Wavelength switching using the Infinera FlexILS manages bulk WDM capacity while packet-OTN switching on the DTN-X XTC and XTM platforms manage sub-wavelength service capacity, providing a complete multi-layer transport and switched solution for any traffic mix. Operators can design and optimize their networks with the right set of platforms and tools from Infinera to achieve maximum efficiency.
Management, Control and Security
Unified network management, control and security is critical to achieving scale and service simplicity that maximizes the value of the network elements as well as the network as a whole. Infinera Management Suite is a feature-rich suite of tools that provides enhanced value for transport networks. Our Xceed suite of software products is a portfolio of SDN solutions that combines an open, multi-layer SDN control platform with applications that enhance revenue sources while increasing network efficiency. Xceed is designed for multi-layer networks and unified SDN control across end-to-end transport networks. Our advanced security capabilities within the Infinite Capacity Engine are designed to provide state-of-the-art encryption technologies at wire speed, with the highest levels of data protection.

Competition
Our current technologies and platforms support three transport equipment markets - long-haul/subsea, DCI and metro.
The optical transport networking equipment market for long-haul and subsea networks is highly competitive but has consolidated significantly over the last decade. The metro market is a highly competitive market that we entered in 2015. The DCI market, which is a subset of the long-haul and metro markets, is a relatively new market that we expect to be highly competitive. Competition in the markets we serve is based on any one or a combination of the following factors:

• | price and other commercial terms;


• | functionality;


• | form factor or density;


• | power consumption;


• | heat dissipation;


• | customer qualification testing;


• | existing business and customer relationships;


• | the ability of products and services to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements;


• | installation and operational simplicity;


• | service and support;


• | security and encryption requirements;


• | scalability and investment protection; and


• | product lead times.

Competition in the optical transport equipment market is intense, and we expect such competition to increase. In the long-haul market, our main competitors include WDM suppliers such as Ciena Corporation, Coriant, Huawei, Nokia and ZTE. In the metro market, we face the same competitors as in long-haul, plus Cisco Systems, Inc., ADVA Optical Networking and Fujitsu. In addition, there are several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete with our offerings. During 2016, several competitors including many named above announced or started to ship competing small-form-factor DCI solutions. In addition to the current competitors, other companies have, or may in the future develop, products that are or could be competitive with our products. We also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete. Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, which could harm our results of operations.
Some of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical, financial and marketing resources along with better established relationships with service providers and other potential customers than we have. Many of our competitors have more resources and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies. In addition, many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively. Further, many of our competitors have built long-standing relationships with some of our prospective customers and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could, therefore, have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers.

We also use distribution or support partners to enter new markets or when requested by a potential customer. Our sales team has significant previous experience with the buying process and sales cycles typical of high-value telecommunications products. 
The sales process for our products entails discussions with prospective customers, analyzing their networks and identifying how they can utilize our systems capabilities within their networks. This process requires developing strong customer relationships, and we expect to leverage our sales force and customer support capabilities to establish relationships with both domestic and international service providers.
Over the course of the sales cycle, potential customers often test our products before buying. Prior to commercial deployment, the customer will generally perform a field trial of our products. Upon successful completion, the customer generally accepts the products installed in its network and may continue with commercial deployment of additional products. We anticipate that our sales cycle, from initial contact with a service provider through the signing of a purchase agreement, may, in some cases, take several quarters.
Direct Sales Force. Our sales team sells directly to service providers worldwide. We maintain a sales presence throughout the United States, as well as in a number of international locations, including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Russia and the United Kingdom. We continued to expand our sales force in 2016 to increase our presence in certain key customer verticals and to support the sales of our expanded portfolio of products. Going forward, the addition of incremental sales headcount is expected to be success-based and in support of new customer accounts.
Indirect Sales Force. We have and will continue to employ business consultants and, resale and logistics partners to assist in our sales efforts and to accelerate and strengthen our customer relationships. We expect to work with business partners to assist our customers in the sale, deployment and maintenance of our systems and have entered into distribution and resale agreements to facilitate the sale and support of our products.
Marketing and Product Management. Our product management team is responsible for defining the product features and go-to-market plan required to maximize our success in the marketplace. Product management supports our sales efforts with product and application expertise. Our corporate marketing team works to create demand for our products by communicating our value proposition and differentiation through direct customer interaction, public relations, attendance at tradeshows and other events, as well as programs via the internet and other marketing channels.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. To this end, we have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in various fields, including systems, sub-systems, software and components. Our research and development efforts are currently focused in Sunnyvale, California; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Beijing, China; Bangalore, India; Kanata, Canada; and Stockholm, Sweden. We have invested significant time and financial resources into the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products. We will continue to expand our product offerings and the capabilities of existing products in the future and plan to dedicate significant resources to these continued research and development efforts. We are continually increasing the scalability and software features of our current platforms. We are also working to develop new generations of optical engines, and we intend to enable further integration in the Infinera Intelligent Transport Network architecture through continued research and development. We also plan to increase the cadence by which we bring new products to market. We believe that these efforts will continue to allow us to be competitive in the markets we currently serve but will allow us to address adjacent markets to fuel our future growth.
Our research and development expenses were $232.3 million, $180.7 million and $133.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,240 employees. A total of 1,034 of those employees were located outside of the United States. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions may be represented by local workers’ councils and/or collective bargaining agreements, as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our employee relationships to be good.

Manufacturing
We have invested significant time and capital to develop and improve the manufacturing process that we use to produce and package our products. This includes significant investments in personnel, equipment and the facilities needed to manufacture and package our products in Sunnyvale, California and Allentown, Pennsylvania. We also have invested in automating our manufacturing process and in training and maintaining the quality of our manufacturing workforce. As a leader in the development of photonic integration, our manufacturing processes have been developed over several years and are protected through a combination of trade secrets, patents and contractual protections. We believe that the investments we have made towards the manufacturing and packaging of our products provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our current manufacturing facilities, including our fabrication facility for our PICs in Sunnyvale, California, can accommodate an increase in production capacity as our business continues to grow.
            We also use contract manufacturers to assemble portions of our products. Each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast according to our specifications and bills of material. Despite outsourcing certain manufacturing operations for cost-effective scale and flexibility, we perform rigorous in-house quality control testing to ensure the reliability of our products. Our supply chain risk mitigation strategies are continuous and are institutionalized in our supply chain design for external manufacturing and for procurement of components. We currently use four contract manufacturers in six different countries, China, Malaysia, Mexico, Sweden, Hungary and Thailand, as well as the capability to redirect manufacturing to U.S. qualified factories of three electronic manufacturing services partners.
We expect all suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which addresses the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility and compliance with applicable laws.
Backlog
As of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015, our total order backlog was approximately $74.0 million and $87.1 million, respectively. Our backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future shipments. Our backlog is subject to future events that could cause the amount or timing of the related revenue to change, and, in certain cases, may be canceled without penalty. Orders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt or may relate to multi-year support service obligations. As a result, we believe that backlog should not be viewed as an accurate indicator of future operating results for any particular period. A backlogged order may not result in revenue in a particular period, and the actual revenue may not be equal to our backlog amounts. Our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with that of other companies in our industry.
Intellectual Property
We believe our success depends upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
Our PIC and PIC manufacturing processes, including design, fabrication and testing of our PICs, are protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets and contractual protections. However, there can be no assurances that these protections will be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage or that others have not or will not reverse engineer our designs or discover, develop or disclose the same or similar designs and manufacturing processes.
As of December 31, 2016, we held 386 U.S. patents and 80 international patents expiring between 2021 and 2036, and held 118 U.S. and 47 foreign pending patent applications. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.
We may not receive any competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property. Any patents granted to us may be contested, circumvented or invalidated over the course of our business, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the impact of these patents cannot be predicted with certainty.
We believe that the frequency of assertions of patent infringement is increasing as patent holders, including entities that are not in our industry and who purchase patents as an investment or to monetize such rights by obtaining royalties, use such actions as a competitive tactic as well as a source of additional revenue. For example, we are currently involved in litigation for alleged patent infringement. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” for additional information regarding this lawsuit. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or could include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our 
10

products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.
In addition to trade secret and patent protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary software and other confidential information. This protection is accomplished through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and through a combination of U.S. and international copyright laws.
We license some of our software pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on our customers’ ability to use such software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by relying on non-disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreements with our employees and consultants that acknowledge our exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individual during the course of his or her work with us. The agreements also require that each person maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. We also rely on contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products.
We incorporate open source software into our products. Although we monitor our use of open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Environmental Matters
We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products and services. Our business and operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive, Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations adopted by the European Union. Environmental regulation is increasing and we expect that our operations will be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which may expose us to additional costs. We are also subject to disclosure requirements related to the presence of "conflict minerals" in our products. To date, our compliance costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
