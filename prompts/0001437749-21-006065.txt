--------+------------------------

Overview
 
Oculus VisionTech Inc. (OVTZ) is a Canadian-based development-stage technology company focused on cyber security, data privacy and data protection solutions for Enterprise business customers. Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the company was originally founded by image processing experts and is operated by experienced leadership. Currently, OVTZ is expanding and investing in a suite of new data protection and data privacy security products that will revolutionize CCPA, GDPR, LGPD and other data privacy legislation compliance for both data subjects and data controllers worldwide. Our mission is to provide intelligent software tools for continual enablement of data privacy and data protection for individuals, organizations and their customers worldwide, through a vision of mutually trusted data governance compliance.
 
Our Forget-Me-Yes™ data privacy product is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform developed to specifically address the global ‘Right-to-be-Forgotten’ (RtbF) and Right-of-Erase (RoE) legal components of Brazil’s LGPD, Europe’s GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Nevada SB220, and Washington Privacy Act (WPA) regulatory compliance. Additional new data protection software tools are being developed to address public cloud data governance compliance globally. Our Cloud Document Protection System (Cloud-DPS) technology leverages our digital watermarking technology enabling OVTZ to offer a SaaS-based document management platform for tamper-proof document authentication and protection. Historically, we have used our digital watermarking technology for streaming video content distribution based on embedded digital watermarking, as well as video-on-demand (VOD) systems, services and source-to-destination digital media delivery solutions that allow live or recorded digitized and compressed video to be transmitted through Internet, intranet, satellite or wireless connectivity.
 
We were incorporated on April 18, 1986, as "First Commercial Financial Group Inc." in the Province of Alberta, Canada. In 1989, our name was changed to "Micron Metals Canada Corp.", which purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of USA Video Inc., a Texas corporation, in order to focus on the digital media business. In 1995, we changed our name to "USA Video Interactive Corp." and continued out of the Province of Alberta into the State of Wyoming. At a shareholders meeting held on December 30, 2011, a resolution was passed to change our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." and to alter our share capital by way of a reverse stock split (share consolidation) on the basis of fifteen old common shares for one new common share. On January 25, 2012, we changed our name to "Oculus VisionTech Inc." In June 2020, OVTZ acquired OCL Technologies Inc. (OCL), a Delaware corporation data privacy software development startup based in San Diego, California. As a 100% wholly-owned subsidiary of OVTZ and to better align with customer and market focus, OCL has completed a corporate name change to ComplyTrust™ Inc. (CTI) on January 21, 2021. All OCL references throughout this document are synonymous with the new name change, CTI.
 
Our executive and corporate headquarter offices are located at Suite 507, 837 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 3N6. Our telephone number is 1-800-684-0183 and our facsimile number is 604-685-5777. Our email address is contact@ovtz.com and our website is www.ovtz.com. Our common shares are listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX.V – OVT, OTCQB – OVTZ, FSE – USF1).
 
Business Environment and Market Opportunity
 
In this age of digital transformation, data monetization, IoT, and massive data migration to converged hyperscale, geo-disbursed Cloud infrastructure and workloads, data protection and data privacy have taken center stage. GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, and many other new international (China, India) and upcoming US data privacy regulations enable individuals and organizations the right to access and request deletion of all personal information for a given data subject. In our ever increasing Everything-as-a-Service world, OVTZ recognizes the need for global cloud-native data privacy and data protection solutions that are multi-cloud platform-ready and can augment both existing legacy and newer agile-driven architectures. OVTZ is building modular microservices-based software solutions and services for both hybrid on-premise and multi-cloud data management that incorporate automated malware, privacy and ransomware scanning, reporting and visualization.

Our new Forget-Me-Yes™ (FMY) Software-as-a-Service (Saas) data privacy solution is a highly-secure, Zero-Knowledge platform providing a single-source capability of continuous ‘right-to-be-forgotten’ (RtbF) and ‘right-of-erase’ (RoE) privacy compliance by incorporating automated policy-driven re-query services that guarantees a Data Subject’s requested RtbF/RoE data remains ‘forgotten’ over the life of their FMY subscription. FMY incorporates hybrid polymorphic encryption technology that ensures all User Interface, data-in-transit and data-at-rest remain secure and can only be accessed by the subscriber. With a cloud-native architecture, the FMY functionality can be utilized as either a complete turnkey SaaS subscription platform, or individually licensed for seamless integration with existing 3rd. party applications and data privacy platforms.
 
Our new ComplyTrust™ Software-as-a-Service Suite (CTSS) is a set of software tools specifically designed to address cloud-native data management and regulatory compliant data governance. CTSS will help to remove enterprise organizational barriers and blockers to further enable successful cloud migration and deployment that benefit the cloud infrastructure providers, enterprise organizations, and users collectively. CTSS helps to automate and visualize cloud compliance reporting across accounts, regions and services based on a variety of user-definable and data driven metrics.
 
OVTZ had recognized that cloud-based, digital document security/protection products were a potentially viable business opportunity for the Company that allowed us to apply our proprietary real-time digital video watermarking technology, originally developed for studios and networks in the entertainment industry, to the digital document security/protection market. Cloud-DPS secures and protects digital documents (including text documents, photos, blueprints, etc.) from any modification, and/or attempted forgery by imperceptibly watermarking documents, using real-time image processing and watermarking algorithms, embedded into a secured/protected copy of a document. This authentication and verification process ensures the integrity of the original digital document.
 
Strategic Plan 
 
Our strategic plan is to first introduce the cloud-native Forget-Me-Yes™ (FMY) data privacy SaaS platform under the AWS Web Services Cloud infrastructure on a monthly subscription basis for structured data. Initial release will include subscriber connections specific to Salesforce organizations with other connectors to be added over time, including but not limited to Hubspot, Marketo, Shopify, and more. Additional connectors for Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) providers for MySQL, NoSQL and SQL databases, for both structured and unstructured data, are also planned. Going forward, we plan to license FMY API microservices for integration with 3rd. party application partners, software providers and potential OEM’s. FMY’s cloud native enables it to be integrated and run under any on-premises, hybrid or alternative cloud infrastructure.
 
The ComplyTrust™ SaaS Suite (CTSS) strategic plan for the data protection market is to first introduce Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools to help AWS customers better manage organizational data protection and compliance in an automated and cloud-native fashion. As customer attainment increases, additional planned CTSS features will be rolled out to perform additional applicable data governance and management functionality. Additional CTSS plans include integration with 3rd. party software providers to provide an automated single-pane-of-glass solution for enterprise organizations worldwide.
 
The Cloud-DPS plan is to re-evaluate the current potential addressable market and underlying architecture to determine next steps in the Cloud-DPS evolution, as it very well could become an additional component in the CTSS toolset. Limited past market adoption and revenues indicate the need for a new Cloud-DPS strategy going forward, stay tuned.
 
Proprietary Technologies 
 
Our Forget-Me-Yes™ patent-pending process locates, organizes and manages Data Subject RtbF and RoE personal information for FMY subscribers in a secure, efficient and persistent way. Automated and schedule compliance enables organizations to avoid regulatory distraction to focus on core business competencies. Our FMY zero-knowledge 3rd. party audit features provide arguable good faith and best practices to avoid litigation, fines, penalties and potential brand damage associated with bad publicity surrounding a data privacy compliance infraction.
 
Our DPS technology ‘personalizes’ protected documents, based on their content, thereby creating a format invariant watermarking system. A document converted into a PDF document is encrypted before delivery, such that it cannot be opened without providing proper credentials. The result is that a document watermarking system can be offered as a cloud-based software service that can:
 

o | Protect - Accept any incoming document through a web portal, watermark it and return the watermarked document as a PDF document.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Authenticate - The "document authenticator" is also a cloud-based software service that can accept the watermarked document and validate the authenticity of the documents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our DPS technology combines the access control security for electronic documents, forensic grade anti-tampering technology based on the document's content "understanding", and optional data storage into a single, unique solution. Because of its cloud-based scalable architecture, the DPS has potential to expand and grow into a complete document management, security and storage eco-system within the CTSS product suite, particularly in conjunction with FMY-specific unstructured data privacy scanning capabilities.

Acquisition of ComplyTrust Inc. (formerly OCL Technologies Corp.)
 
On June 5th, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of OCL Technologies Corp. www.ocltechnologies.com (hereafter “OCL”), a Delaware Corporation, with its head office located in the technology hub of San Diego, California. OCL is specifically focused on providing enterprise organizations and individuals with highly-secure data privacy tools that provide sustained and continuous global regulatory compliance of data subject rights, while independently protecting all parties. With the burgeoning growth of privacy regulation worldwide coupled with strict regulatory oversight, companies are dedicating significant resources to achieve and maintain compliance. In the past two years alone, initiatives such as the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation effective May 25, 2018) as well as the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act passed June 28, 2018 and effective January 1, 2020) have mandated privacy rights and data protection for entities and individuals contemplated within their legislative frameworks. In addition to these, there are additional data privacy legislative initiatives on-going in Asia and both North and South America which will require data protection solutions. Oculus believes that the acquisition of OCL is a tremendous fit within its core objective of developing robust cutting edge technologies that address focused customer data protection requirements on a global scale.
 
Consideration for the acquisition of OCL is 12,500,000 common shares of the Company and 12,500,000 share purchase warrants exercisable for a period of five years from date of issuance. The share purchase warrants are exercisable only upon specific performance criteria being met. Such criteria being 1) revenue sales projections per OCL’s proformas, or 2) listing on a major US exchange, or 3) change of control as defined below:
 

i. | Meeting sales forecasts:

Intellectual Property 
 
Our success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely upon patents, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology products and services.
 
On June 19, 2001, United States Patent Application No. 09/884,787, "Method and Apparatus for Digitally Fingerprinting Videos", was officially filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This patent is for "MediaSentinel™". This patent expired in February of 2010. At this time, we have elected not to patent our Cloud-DPS technology until additional software development review is initiated to determine Cloud-DPS refresh requirements to be viable in today’s cloud-native world.
 
Patent-pending technology encompassing the Forget-Me-Yes™ data privacy architecture includes our hybrid Zero-Knowledge data security process along with proprietary query engine and automated re-query services processes.
 
In October 20202, trademark applications were made by OVTZ for both Forget-Me-Yes™ and ComplyTrust™.
 

Laws and Regulations
 
Our operations are or may be subject to various international, federal, provincial, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the marketing of products and relationships with data protection, intellectual property protection, the export of technology products to certain countries and privacy protection. Although we believe that we are compliance with all international, federal, provincial, state and local regulations, the risk of claims and actions against us for breach of the aforesaid laws cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of a breach of these laws, we could be held liable for any damages that result. The amount of such damages could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Employees 
 
We currently have no employees. We engage independent contractors to provide services as necessary. Compensation for current and future work will be conducted on a contract basis. 
 
The loss of the services of any key management could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. We do not maintain key man life insurance on the life of its officers. In addition, our future success will depend in part upon its continuing ability to hire, train, motivate and retain key senior management and skilled technical and marketing personnel. Competition for technical personnel in the industry we compete in is intense. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to contract, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. To date, we have had limited success in recruiting qualified contractors, but there is no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future. Attracting qualified expertise is contingent on raising sufficient working capital and project advancement.

OCULUS VISIONTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 December 31, 2020 and 2019
(Stated in US Dollars) 
 


 
1. | BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS
---+-----------------------------------

 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Oculus and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, USVO Inc. (dissolved December 31, 2019) and OCL Technologies Corp. (from the date of acquisition, Note 6).
 
Oculus VisionTech, Inc. (the "Company") is a designer of digital watermarking services and solutions. At December 31, 2020 and for the two-year period then ended, substantially all of the Company's assets and substantially all its operations are located and conducted in the United States and Canada.



 
2. | GOING CONCERN
---+--------------

 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the financial statements, the Company has incurred a loss of $2,772,484 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and, in addition the Company incurred losses of $192,865 and $183,279 for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $44,159,180 and a working capital of $328,205. These conditions raise doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations as they come due which management believes it will be able to do. To date, the Company has funded operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and warrants to outside investors and the Company’s management. The Company believes that its operations will generate additional funds and that additional funding from outside investors and the Company’s management will continue to be available to the Company when needed. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.



 
3. | SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
---+-------------------------------------------

 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 
The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts.
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
The Company sells its products to customers on an open credit basis. The Company’s trade accounts receivable are due from such customers and are generally uncollateralized. Management closely monitors outstanding accounts receivable and charges off to expense any balances that are determined to be uncollectible or establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no account receivable.
 
   38

 

Revenue from hardware product sales is recognized when the product has been shipped and the collection of payment is reasonably assured. Revenue recognized from these sales is net of applicable provisions for refunds, discounts and allowances. Engineering services sales are recognized upon the service having been provided. The Company had no hardware product sales in 2020 or 2019.
 
Revenue from software sales is recognized when the product has been delivered. Revenue from multiple element contracts (hardware, software and engineering) is allocated to the various elements based on fair value. If objective evidence of fair value is not available, revenue from these contracts is deferred until the earlier of when objective evidence of fair value does exist or all elements of the contract have been delivered. Discounts will be applied to each element on a proportionate basis. No portion of the revenue will be recognized if the portion of the revenue allocable to delivered elements is subject to forfeiture, refund or other concession. The Company had no software sales in 2020 or 2019.
 
Revenue is recognized for digital water marking based on a contracted usage schedule on a monthly billing cycle. Revenue for digital watermarking software usage totaled $-0- in 2020 and 2019.
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating loss carry forwards measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company periodically evaluates the reliability of its net deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
The foreign assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments is immaterial at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
Basic loss per common share ("EPS") is computed as net loss divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the impact of common stock potentially issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 there were no potentially issuable common stock, except for stock purchase warrants.
 
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.
 


 
4. | PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS
---+------------------------------------------

 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:
 
 
 | 2020 | | 2019 | 
Prepaid expenses | $ | 1,030 | | $ | -

6. | ACQUISITION OF OCL TECHNOLOGIES CORP.
---+--------------------------------------

 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company acquired a 100% interest in OCL Technologies Corp. (“OCL”) by issuing 12,500,000 shares with a fair value of $1,380,427 and contingent consideration consisting of 12,500,000 non-transferable warrants with a fair value of $414,128. The transaction does not meet the definition of a business as defined in ASC 805-10. As a result, the acquisition of OCL has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, whereby all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned a carrying amount based on their relative fair values. Upon closing of the transaction, OCL became a subsidiary of the Company. The net assets acquired pursuant to the acquisition are as follows:
 
 
Purchase Price | | 
------------------------------------+---+----------
Issuance of 12,500,000 shares | $ | 1,380,427
Contingent consideration - warrants | | 414,128 
Transaction costs | | 54,532 
Total Purchase Price | $ | 1,849,087



Contingent consideration consists of 12,500,000 non-transferable warrants that are exercisable into 12,500,000 common shares if certain criteria are met at an exercise price of $0.001 for a period of five years from the date of issuance expiry June 4, 2025. No share purchase warrants are exercisable until specific performance criteria have been met. Such criteria being 1) revenue sales projections per OCL’s 5 year proformas, or 2) listing on a major US exchange, or 3) change of control. The Company has estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $414,128.
 
 
Purchase Price Allocation | | | 
--------------------------------------------+---+-----------+--
Cash | $ | 114,169 | 
Accounts payable and due from related party | | (232,021 | )
Intangible asset | | 1,966,939 | 
Total Purchase Price | $ | 1,849,087 | 



During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company impaired the intangible asset resulting an expense on the consolidated statement of operations of $1,966,939.

9. | COVID-19
---+---------

 
In December 2019, a coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In March 2020, the WHO declared it a global pandemic. COVID-19 continued to spread globally, directly impacting worldwide economic activity and financial markets. The extent of the COVID-19 impact to future operational and financial performance will depend on the duration and spread of the outbreak, related public health measures, and their impact on the macroeconomy. While the Company expects this matter to negatively impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, the extent of the financial impact and duration cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, as none of these impacts can be predicted with certainty.
