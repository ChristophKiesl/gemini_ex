Item 1. Business
Our Company
    CorePoint Lodging Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a publicly traded (NYSE: CPLG) self-administered lodging REIT primarily serving the upper midscale and midscale lodging segments, with a portfolio of select-service hotels located in the United States (“U.S.”). 
2020 Highlights
•Net loss of $178 million, or $3.14 per fully diluted share, including a non-cash impairment charge of $54 million for 2020 as compared to a net loss of $212 million, or $3.71 per fully diluted share, including a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million, for 2019.
•Executed proactive cost containment measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including reducing staffing levels, eliminating non-essential amenity offerings, minimizing discretionary expenditures at all hotels, and with respect to corporate spending, deferring most non-essential capital investments, suspending our common stock dividends and proactively drawing $110 million from our Revolving Credit Facility to maintain liquidity.
•Operations stabilized, all hotels are open and by the end of the year the portfolio achieved over 75% of pre-pandemic occupancy levels for December 2020 as compared to December 2019, and as of December 31, 2020, we have $143 million of cash and cash equivalents.
•Sold 61 hotels for gross proceeds of $274 million, resulting in a gain on sales of $71 million.
•Reduced outstanding CMBS Facility debt by $196 million.
•Extended the debt maturity of our CMBS Facility and Revolving Credit Facility to June 2021 and May 2021, respectively, and eliminated certain financial covenants on the Revolving Credit Facility through the extended maturity date.
•Paid common stock dividends of $22 million, or $0.40 per share.
Our Properties
    Our portfolio, as of December 31, 2020, consisted of 209 select-service hotels in the U.S. representing approximately 27,800 rooms across 35 states with locations in or near employment centers, airports, and major travel thoroughfares. All but one of our hotels are wholly owned. We primarily derive our revenues from our hotel operations.

We are a select-service hotel owner, which means that our hotels provide limited amenities and we are focused on providing clean and convenient hotel lodging at lower price points. Our hotels generally offer limited food offerings (such as free buffet style breakfast), free internet access, free parking and a lower average daily rate (“ADR”) than a full-service hotel which may offer restaurants, banquet and meeting facilities, spa services, and other amenities. We believe guests are attracted to select-service hotels given their attractive value proposition. 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions to our hotel operations, including restrictions imposed by local authorities, general business shutdowns, temporary suspension of guest reservations and decreased travel demand. These disruptions resulted in operating losses and decreased liquidity beginning in March 2020, and we believe we reached our low point in occupancy and rates in April 2020. As the year progressed, we started to see some recovery with a narrowing of the gap as compared to our 2019 levels of occupancy and rates. While our operations have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, there has not yet been a general double dip to the economy or overall travel demand in the markets we serve.
Many business customers stopped traveling as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic while leisure travel continued in certain areas, which resulted in the proportion of our room revenues attributed to leisure travel increasing during 2020. Leisure travel is strongest in our hotels in “drive-to” locations, conveniently located along interstate highways and in suburban areas. As of December 31, 2020, approximately two-thirds of our hotels were located along interstate highways or in suburban areas, which allows easier access for “drive to” destination travelers. Further, many of our hotel properties have also benefited as a result of providing guests exterior access rooms, which provide minimal or no contact with common areas or lobbies. We have also ceased providing a buffet style breakfast at most of our hotels, which further limits potential exposure for guests. Accordingly, we believe our select-service hotels have generally performed better, with higher occupancy and smaller room rate decreases, than full service hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Part II -Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic” for additional discussion of the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The rent potential for a hotel is measured by its ADR and is primarily a factor of its chain scale, location, local demand drivers and competition. Our ADR and occupancy by chain scale groupings commonly used in the lodging industry for the year ended December 31, 2020 are as follows: 

 | Number of Hotels | ADR | | Occupancy
Upscale | 3 | $ | 122.95 | | 26.9 | %
Upper midscale | 17 | $ | 101.39 | | 47.9 | %
Midscale | 112 | $ | 80.79 | | 47.7 | %
Economy | 77 | $ | 62.39 | | 47.2 | %
Total | 209 | $ | 76.73 | | 47.2 | %


As an owner of hotels, we can capture the full benefit of increases in operating profits during periods of increasing demand or increasing ADR. The cost structure of our typical hotel is more fixed than variable, so as demand and ADR increase over time, the pace of increase in operating profits typically is higher than the pace of increase of revenues. The profits realized by us are generally significantly affected by economic conditions, primarily changes in employment, gross domestic product and inflation. Consequently, in 2020, as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our ADR and occupancy decreased as compared to 2019. As discussed below, we expect continued depressed revenue and occupancy metrics during 2021, until travel demand returns once vaccines are available and COVID-19 infection rates decline. We are unable to forecast if or when travel demand will return to 2019 levels. 
Hotel ownership is capital intensive, as we are responsible for the costs and capital expenditures for our hotels. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate additional capital projects, including expenditures for recurring maintenance as well as improvements and renovations, which are expected to drive higher revenues. As a consequence of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have deferred most elective, non-life and safety related repairs and improvements. We intend to complete those deferred capital expenditures once operations have stabilized, and we will seek to invest in those hotels that we believe will provide an appropriate return on capital investment and maintain or increase property revenue and gross margin.
Brand Affiliation

    All of our hotels currently operate under the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.’s (“Wyndham”) highly recognizable La Quinta brand.  There are over 900 La Quinta hotels worldwide. We believe our properties derive value from their affiliation with the La Quinta brand and benefit from the operational expertise, extensive distribution network, strong commercial engines and additional resources of one of the nation’s largest hotel brands. 

    For certain of our hotels, our franchisor may change the hotel brand. As of December 31, 2020, three of our hotels currently operating under the La Quinta brand have been identified that may, in the future, be re-flagged to operate under another Wyndham brand in accordance with our franchise and management agreements.
Our Business, Growth and Financing Strategies 
    Our objective is to generate favorable long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders through disciplined capital allocation, proactive asset management, maintaining balance sheet strength and enhancing the value of our properties. We intend to pursue this objective through the following strategies:

•Disciplined capital allocation.   We are a pure-play lodging REIT strategically focused on the midscale and upper midscale select-service lodging segments. The midscale and upper midscale segments are among the largest segments of the lodging industry by property count. These midscale hotels have historically generated higher margins than full-service sectors. Midscale hotels have also performed better during economic downturns. We intend to focus on the top metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) markets, as well as other markets with close proximity to multiple demand generators, such as medical facilities, corporate offices, airports, convention centers, universities and leisure attractions, with a diverse source of potential guests, including corporate, government and leisure travelers. Using these criteria, we have identified 105 hotels which constitute our core hotels. In addition, the midscale and upper midscale select-service lodging segments are highly fragmented. We believe there are opportunities to acquire hotels from smaller owner operators, particularly owners with a higher cost of capital. Such a disciplined acquisition strategy would allow us to expand our presence in target markets and in properties meeting our core hotel criteria, which will also provide diversification over time, including through the acquisition of hotels that are affiliated with other respected hotel brands and operators.
•Portfolio transformation. We have identified non-core hotels which do not meet our growth and return objectives. These include hotels not in our identified key markets or lodging segment and that are older with higher maintenance capital needs. 
As of December 31, 2019, we identified 166 hotels as non-core, and as of December 31, 2020, we have sold or disposed of 62 of these non-core hotels. We expect to dispose of the remaining non-core hotels by the end of 2022; however, this period may be extended or shortened depending on market conditions, COVID-19 pandemic status and availability of capital for hotel purchasers. We believe that the execution of this disposition strategy, along with our proactive asset management of our core hotels, will enable us to maintain a geographically diversified portfolio and increase our revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) and gross margins, while reducing the average age of the portfolio and recurring capital expenditures.
•Build and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet. We seek to build and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet that will provide us with liquidity to meet our operational and growth needs and support a well-covered dividend over time. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $143 million. As we execute our disposition strategy, we intend to use net proceeds to reduce our debt outstanding. Coupled with realizing a more robust economic recovery, our long-term objective is to reduce our leverage to below 5.0x net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to Adjusted EBITDAre. (See “Part II-Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definition and discussion of our non-GAAP measures). During 2020, we used $196 million of our net hotel sales proceeds to reduce our CMBS Facility debt. Since the initial funding of our CMBS Facility in 2018, we have reduced our CMBS Facility debt by $310 million. By initially reducing leverage, we believe we will have opportunities to further grow our portfolio, which could include revenue-enhancing improvements or acquisitions. We will also focus on preserving sufficient liquidity with minimal short-dated debt maturities and intend to refinance or extend our existing facilities. In March 2021, we extended the maturity on our Revolving Facility to May 2022.
    In addition, we intend to create value through repositioning select hotels across brands or chain scale segments and exploring adaptive reuse opportunities to ensure our assets achieve their highest and best use. Further, we have a long term focus on maintaining our properties and adapting to evolving customer preferences by making incremental capital expenditures that will provide an acceptable return on investment.
Our Principal Operating Agreements

Management Agreements

    On May 30, 2018, we entered into separate hotel management agreements with LQM, a subsidiary of Wyndham and currently the manager of all of our hotel properties, whereby we pay a fee equal to 5% of total gross revenues, as defined. Our management fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $20 million. 

    LQM generally has sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels. LQM also provides all employees for the hotels, prepares reports, budgets and projections, and provides other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels.  We have consultative and specified approval rights with respect to certain actions of LQM, including entering into long-term or high value contracts, engaging in certain actions relating to legal proceedings, approving the operating budget, making certain capital expenditures and the hiring of certain management personnel.  We are also responsible for reimbursing LQM for certain costs incurred by LQM during the fulfillment of their duties, such as payroll costs for certain employees and other costs that the manager incurs to operate the hotels.  The term of the management agreements is through May 30, 2038, subject to two renewals of five years each, at LQM’s option.  There are penalties for early termination.
Franchise Agreements
    On May 30, 2018, we entered into separate hotel franchise agreements with LQ Franchising, a subsidiary of Wyndham and currently the franchisor of all of our hotel properties, with a term through May 30, 2038. As franchisee, 12 to 24 months prior to initial expiration of the applicable franchise agreement, we have the opportunity to request a renewal term of an additional ten years by notice to the franchisor, payment of a renewal fee and execution of the franchisor’s then current form of franchise agreement.  The franchisor then has 60 days to make a determination whether to renew.  There are also penalties for early termination; however, both we and the franchisor have the option to cancel the franchise agreements in 2033, the 15th year anniversary, with no penalty to either party. Pursuant to the franchise agreements, we were granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use our franchisor’s brand names, marks and system in the operation of our hotels.  The franchisor also may provide us with a variety of services and benefits, including centralized reservation systems, participation in customer loyalty programs, national advertising, marketing programs and publicity designed to increase brand awareness as well as training of personnel.  In return we are required to operate our hotels consistent with the applicable brand standards.  
    Our franchise agreements require that we pay a 5% royalty fee on gross room revenues. Our total royalty expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $20 million. 

    In addition to the royalty fee, the franchising agreements include a reservation fee of 2% of gross room revenues, a marketing fee of 2.5% of gross room revenues, a loyalty program fee of 5% of eligible room night revenues, and other miscellaneous ancillary fees.  Reservation fees are included within rooms expense, and the marketing fee and loyalty program fees are included within other departmental and support expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  

    Our requirement to meet certain brand standards imposed by our franchisor includes requirements that we incur certain capital expenditures, generally ranging from $1,500 to $7,500 per hotel room (with various specific amounts within this range being applicable to different groups of our hotels) during a prescribed period generally ranging from two to eleven years.  These amounts are over and above the capital expenditures we are required to make each year for recurring furniture, fixtures and equipment maintenance.  However, these amounts that we are required to spend are subject to reduction, in varying degrees, by the amount of capital expenditures made for hotels in the applicable group over and above the capital expenditures required for recurring maintenance in one or more years before receipt of the franchisor’s notice. The initial period during which the franchisor can notify us that we must make these capital expenditures is through 2028. At the franchisor’s discretion, subject to the franchise agreement provisions governing when such requirements may be imposed, the franchisor may provide a notice obligating us to meet those capital expenditure requirements generally within two to nine years of the notice. As of December 31, 2020, no such notices have been received; however, approximately 58% of our hotels are potentially eligible for such capital expenditure requirements. Through 2028, our remaining hotels will become eligible for such notices and capital expenditure requirements. We expect to meet these requirements primarily through our recurring capital expenditure program. 
As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our franchisor has waived any brand standards that require capital investment (except for health and safety standards) until January 1, 2021. Our franchisor has also waived the requirement of having the standard buffet style breakfast, and instead, at certain locations and depending on the demand, other offerings such as “grab and go” bags may be available. The removal of the buffet breakfast has allowed us to reduce a portion of our operating expenses during 2020. To date, we do not believe the relief of these brand standards has adversely affected our guest demand. When those brand standards are re-introduced, we will incur additional operating costs as compared to 2020.

    In connection with the sale of a hotel where the buyer is assuming the franchise agreement, the franchise agreements provide certain obligations for the buyer which may affect the terms of our hotel sales. These provisions include the franchisor’s approval of the buyer, transfer fees and capital expenditure assessments to meet the franchisor’s current brand standards. 
Ground Leases

    As of December 31, 2020, we maintained ground lease arrangements with third parties for 14 hotel properties that generally contain base rent and contingent rent provisions based upon the respective hotel’s revenues.  Many of these lease agreements contain renewal options at fair market value at the conclusion of the initial lease term.  The initial term maturity dates range from 2022 to 2096.  
    Our ground lease rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $3 million. We are also responsible for property taxes associated with the land parcel. Our ground leases are generally assumable by a hotel buyer in the event of a sale. In certain sale situations, we may be required to guarantee certain performance by the hotel buyer to the ground lessor. 
    For certain ground leases, we may choose not to renew the lease. Our current debt agreements require us to exercise any ground lease renewals for properties encumbered by the loan during the term of the debt. For the ground lease related to our Clifton property that matures in 2022, which is not encumbered by our debt, we have been notified that we may not be able to renew the lease. If we decide not to renew a ground lease, or are unable to, this may result in ownership of the property being conveyed to the ground lessor and our paying off the applicable allocated debt principal, if any, and liquidated damages to our franchisor.
Human Capital

    As of December 31, 2020, we had 32 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. We believe relations with our employees are positive. Our human capital resources objectives include attracting and retaining highly motivated, well-qualified employees. Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees and executives. We use a mix of competitive salaries and other benefits to attract and retain employees and executives. We believe that our employee relations are good, and we are committed to inclusion and policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment. The health and safety of our employees is of primary concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant steps to protect our workforce including but not limited to, working remotely, communicating hygiene and cleaning protocols, and encouraging face-covering usage and social distancing protocols consistent with guidelines issued by federal, state and local law.
    Although not employed by us, our hotels are operated by employees who are employed by our hotel manager, pursuant to our management agreements. Our hotel manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels, including setting compensation amounts, benefits and other labor arrangements.  These expenses are generally reimbursed by us under the terms of the relevant management agreement. Accordingly, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly those hotels with unionized labor, which may affect our hotel manager’s staffing requirements and overall staffing expenses. As of December 31, 2020, our hotel manager’s employees at two of our hotels were represented by labor unions. We believe relations are positive between our hotel manager and its employees at our hotels.
Competition
    The lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels and other lodging for guests on the basis of several factors, including the attractiveness of the facility, location, room rate, quality of accommodations, public and meeting spaces, brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Our competition for guests includes hotels and other lodging catering to both consumers and business travelers. Competition is also often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands primarily in the midscale and upper midscale select-service segments. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, ADR and RevPAR of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability. We believe our hotels enjoy certain competitive advantages as a result of being flagged with nationally recognized brands, including access to centralized reservation systems and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, strong hotel management expertise and guest loyalty programs. We believe our hotels have also benefited from the select-service nature of our offerings, which may provide less exposure for guests during the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions. By offering exterior access rooms, convenience to highways for drive-to guests and contactless check-in and check-out, we believe our hotels have achieved higher occupancy than full service or more common area dependent hotels. 

    Our principal competitors include hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including other lodging REITs) and national and international hotel brands. We have also seen the emergence of a sharing economy with the increasing availability of online short-term rentals, including single family homes. We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. We expect a limited new supply of hotel rooms to come to market in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and may even benefit from a net decline in available rooms as competing hotels temporarily or permanently close. 
We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity investors, institutional pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and numerous local, regional and national owners, including franchisors, in each of our markets. Some of these entities may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able and willing to accept more risk than we believe we can prudently manage. During the recovery phase of the lodging cycle, competition among potential buyers may increase the bargaining power of potential sellers, which may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or increase pricing. Similarly, during times when we seek to sell hotels, competition from other sellers may increase the bargaining power of the potential property buyers.

Seasonality

    The hotel industry is seasonal in nature. Generally, our revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. The timing of holidays, local special events and weekends can also impact our quarterly results. The periods during which our properties experience higher revenues may depend on specific locations and accordingly may vary from property to property. This seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue, profit margin, net earnings and cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, our quarterly results may be seasonally affected by the timing of certain marketing programs or hotel maintenance. In addition, certain of our manager and franchisor fees are based on revenues which, as noted above, vary by season. Further, the impact of disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of opening of newly constructed or renovated hotels and the timing of any hotel acquisitions or dispositions may cause a variation of revenue and earnings from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, our results for any partial period may not be indicative of our full year results or trends. 

    In 2020, the timing of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in disruptions to our operations during the summer months, which have historically been our peak revenue, profitability and cash flow periods, resulting in lower earnings and cash flow and less liquidity to support operations during the traditionally slower winter months. Due to the fluidity of developments with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not able to accurately project the level of operations for the 2021 spring and summer seasons or when we will achieve pre-pandemic operating levels.
Environmental Matters 

    We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our hotels include older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. From time to time, we may be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our hotels. We are required to have operations and maintenance plans that seek to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our hotels, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

REIT Qualification

    We are organized in conformity with and operate in a manner that allows us to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy requirements related to, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the real estate composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. To the extent we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income generated by our REIT activities that we distribute to our stockholders; however, our taxable REIT subsidiaries (our “TRSs”) are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, and we may be subject to state and local taxes. To comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. 
    We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts that meet or exceed the requirements to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT and to avoid corporate level taxation. Prior to making any distributions for U.S. federal tax purposes or otherwise, we must first satisfy our operating and debt service obligations. Although we currently anticipate that our estimated cash available for distribution will exceed the annual distribution requirements applicable to REITs to avoid corporate level taxation, it is possible that it would be necessary to utilize cash reserves, delay certain capital investments, liquidate assets at unfavorable prices or incur additional indebtedness in order to make required distributions.
During 2020, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and our resulting taxable income, we were not required to make any distributions to maintain our REIT qualifications. All of our 2020 distributions to our stockholders were classified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) as a return of capital. Our REIT’s net operating losses may reduce our requirements to make distributions to our stockholders to maintain our REIT status. 

Regulation 

    The lodging industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations in the U.S., including those relating to hospitality ordinances, data security, health and safety, building codes and zoning requirements. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain state and local authorities have issued regulations concerning disinfecting common areas, reporting of known COVID-19 infections and other health measures, while other governmental entities are considering additional health regulations. Also in connection with COVID-19 economic relief measures, the U.S. Congress is considering, among other actions, legislation increasing the national minimum wages. The full scope of these measures is still being determined and consequently, the compliance cost and the changes to our business model that may be required are still not known.
Hotels and their owners and operators are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing their relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. In connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our hotels, we may be required to expend funds to meet federal, state and local regulations. Any failure to obtain or maintain any such licenses or any publicity resulting from actual or alleged violations of any such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We believe that our businesses are conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Insurance

    We maintain insurance coverage for general liability, property (including business interruption), terrorism, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our hotels. Certain of these insurance coverages are provided through policies obtained by our manager or jointly shared with our manager, primarily related to general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability, where we may be identified as a co-insured party.  Through all of these policies, our insurance provides coverage related to claims arising out of the operations of our hotels, where most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks. These policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insured retentions or deductibles, subject to the terms and limits of the policies.
    Due to the combination of storm related claims and COVID-19 exposures generally experienced by the lodging industry, coupled with the older age of our hotels, we have experienced increased premiums, escrows and retention requirements from insurance carriers. This has resulted in increases in operating expenses and loss mitigation capital expenditures and more self-insurance loss claims during 2020, and we expect these trends to continue in the coming year. Some of these payments may result from our obligation to reimburse our manager under our management agreements.
