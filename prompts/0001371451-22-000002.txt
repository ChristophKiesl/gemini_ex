ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Development
    Highwater Ethanol, LLC (“we,” “our,” “Highwater Ethanol” or the “Company”) was formed as a Minnesota limited liability company on May 2, 2006 for the purpose of constructing, owning, and operating a 50 million gallon per year nameplate ethanol plant near Lamberton, Minnesota. Since August 2009, we have been engaged in the production of ethanol and distillers grains at the plant. On October 2019, our air permit application to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to allow for 70.2 million gallons of denatured ethanol per 12-month rolling average was approved. Our ethanol production levels for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 were at an annual rate of approximately 64 million gallons. 
On August 26, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Nelson Baker BioTech, Inc. to install a system which will allow us to produce USP grade high purity alcohol for use in the sanitizer market. We commenced construction in November, 2020. The project was completed in October 2021 and limited production of high purity alcohol commenced. However, we had only limited production of high purity alcohol in our 2021 fiscal year due to current positive margins in ethanol. We expect to begin sales in our 2022 fiscal year. We have executed an agreement with RPMG, Inc. ("RPMG") to be the exclusive marketer of our high purity alcohol. RPMG is currently our exclusive marketer and distributor of ethanol and corn oil. We are also an owner of Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC, the parent entity of RPMG. 
On September 26, 2013, we entered into a series of related definitive agreements with Butamax Advanced Biofuels, LLC ("Butamax") pursuant to which Butamax installed and leased its corn oil separation system and licensed to the Company  corn oil separation technology.  On December 3, 2020, we executed a Termination and Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Butamax agreed to (i) sell the corn oil separation system to the Company; and (ii) provide a license to the Company for its corn oil separation technology to remain in effect until expiration of the patents unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Technology License Agreement. In exchange for the purchase of the corn oil separation system and the license, the Company pre-paid a lump sum fee to Butamax. The Purchase Agreement also provided for the termination of the remaining agreements with Butamax as of December 3, 2020.  
Effective March 15, 2021, we executed a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Third Amendment") with Compeer Financial, PCA f/k/a AgStar Financial Services, PCA, as administrative agent, ("Compeer"), which amends and restates the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated January 22, 2016. The primary purpose of the Third Amendment was to add a Revolving Line of Credit Loan to be used for working capital or ongoing operating expenses. The Revolving Credit Loan is for an amount equal to the Borrowing Base, with a maximum limit of $10,000,000, with a variable interest rate based on at the one-month LIBOR rate plus 325 basis points with no minimum interest rate. The Revolving Line of Credit Loan may be advanced, repaid and re-borrowed during the term. Monthly interest payments are due on the Revolving Line of Credit Loan with payment of all amounts outstanding due on March 15, 2022. We are also required to pay unused commitment fees for the Revolving Line of Credit Loan. The Third Amendment also allows us to make distributions to members as frequently as monthly in an amount equal to 75% of net income if working capital is greater than or equal to $8,250,000, or 100% of net income if working capital is greater than or equal to $11,000,000, or an unlimited amount if working capital is greater than or equal to $11,000,000 and the outstanding balance on the 2020 Term Loan is $0.
Financial Information
Please refer to “ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities and “ITEM 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for our financial statements and supplementary data. 
Principal Products
The principal products we currently produce at the ethanol plant are fuel-grade ethanol and distillers grains. In addition, we are extracting corn oil for sale. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributed to each of our products for each of our last three fiscal years.

Product | Fiscal Year 2021 | | Fiscal Year 2020 | | Fiscal Year 2019
Ethanol | 78 | % | | 77 | % | 78 | %
Distillers Grains | 16 | % | | 19 | % | 19 | %
Corn Oil | 6 | % | | 4 | % | 3 | %

Ethanol
Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains. The ethanol we produce is manufactured from corn. Although the ethanol industry continues to explore production technologies employing various feedstocks, such as biomass, corn-based production technologies remain the most practical and provide the lowest operating risks. Corn produces large quantities of carbohydrates, which convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. 
An ethanol plant is essentially a fermentation plant. Ground corn and water are mixed with enzymes and yeast to produce a substance called “beer,” which contains about 10% alcohol and 90% water. The “beer” is boiled to separate the water, resulting in ethyl alcohol, which is then dehydrated to increase the alcohol content. This product is then mixed with a certified denaturant to make the product unfit for human consumption and commercially saleable. 
Ethanol can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Approximately 95% of all ethanol is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Used as a fuel oxygenate, ethanol provides a means to control carbon monoxide emissions in large metropolitan areas. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally the wholesale gasoline marketer or blender.
Distillers Grains
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, poultry, swine and beef industries. Dry mill ethanol processing creates three forms of distiller grains: Distillers Wet Grains with Solubles (“DWS”), Distillers Modified Wet Grains with Solubles (“DMWS”) and Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (“DDGS”). DWS is processed corn mash that contains approximately 70% moisture. DWS has a shelf life of approximately three days and can be sold only to farms within the immediate vicinity of an ethanol plant. DMWS is DWS that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture. DMWS has a slightly longer shelf life of approximately ten days and is often sold to nearby markets. DDGS is DWS that has been dried to between 10% and 12% moisture. DDGS has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to an ethanol plant.
Corn Oil

    Since April 2014, we have been separating some of the corn oil contained in our distillers grains for sale. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. However, corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses.
Ethanol, Distillers Grains and Corn Oil Markets
As described below in “Distribution Methods” we market and distribute a majority of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil through professional third party marketers. Our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil marketers make decisions with regard to where our products are marketed. 
Our ethanol and distillers grains are primarily sold in the domestic market, however, as domestic production of ethanol and distillers grains continue to expand, we anticipate increased international sales of ethanol and distillers grains. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically.
Over the past fiscal year, Canada, India and South Korea were top destinations for ethanol exports. However, overall exports of ethanol for this period have been lower. Ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. In addition, trade barriers with key markets can negatively affect export demand. Tariffs implemented by Brazil and China on ethanol imported from the United States have had and continue to have a negative effect on export demand from those markets. The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to create uncertainty as to future export demand.
    Historically, the United States ethanol industry has exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China. The imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by China over the past five years has resulted in a significant decline in demand from China requiring United States producers to seek out alternative markets. Over the past year, the United States exported a significant amount of distillers grains to Mexico, South Korea, and Vietnam. Exports of distillers grains increased during 2021 due to increases in supply for the period compared to 2020.
    All of the corn oil we produce is marketed and distributed in the domestic market.
Distribution Methods
Ethanol
    We have an exclusive marketing agreement with RPMG, Inc. (“RPMG”) for the purposes of marketing and distributing our ethanol. Because we are an owner of Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC (“RPMG LLC”), the parent entity of RPMG, our ethanol marketing fees are based on RPMG's cost to market our ethanol. Further, as an owner, we share in the profits and losses generated by RPMG when it markets products for other producers who are not owners of RPMG LLC. Our marketing agreement provides that we can sell our ethanol either through an index arrangement or at an agreed upon fixed price. The term of our marketing agreement is perpetual until terminated according to its terms. The primary reasons for termination would be if we cease to be an owner of RPMG LLC, if there is a breach which is not cured, or if we give advance notice to RPMG that we wish to terminate. Notwithstanding our right to terminate, we may be obligated to continue to market our ethanol through RPMG for a period of time after termination. Further, following termination, we agree to accept an assignment of certain railcar leases which RPMG has secured to service us. If the marketing agreement is terminated, it would trigger a redemption of our ownership interest in RPMG LLC. 
Distillers Grains
    We have a distillers grains marketing agreement with CHS, Inc. ("CHS") to market all the dried distillers grains we produce at the plant. Under the agreement, CHS charges a maximum of $2.00 per ton and a minimum of $1.50 per ton price using 2% of the FOB plant price actually received by CHS for all dried distillers grains removed by CHS from our plant. The agreement will remain in effect unless otherwise terminated by either party with 120 days notice. Under the agreement, CHS is responsible for all transportation arrangements for the distribution of our dried distillers grains. 
    We market and sell our own distillers modified wet grains with solubles without the assistance of a third-party marketer.
Corn Oil
We have an exclusive marketing agreement with RPMG for the purposes of marketing and distributing our corn oil. We pay RPMG a marketing fee. We may immediately terminate our agreement with RPMG upon written notice if: (1) RPMG fails on three separate occasions within a 12-month period to purchase corn oil or market corn oil, as not otherwise excused under the Agreement; or (2) upon RPMG's insolvency. RPMG may immediately terminate the agreement upon written notice if: (A) during any consecutive three (3) months the actual production or inventory of any corn oil product at the plant varies by twenty (20%) or more from the monthly production and inventory estimates provided to RPMG (other than for reasons permitted under the RPMG Agreement); or (B) upon our insolvency.
New Products and Services
We began limited production of USP grade high purity alcohol for use in the hand sanitizer, sanitizer and other markets during our 2021 fiscal year and expect to start selling our high purity alcohol for use in the hand sanitizer, sanitizer and other markets during our 2022 fiscal year. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
Corn Feedstock Supply
The major raw material required for our ethanol plant to produce ethanol and distillers grains is corn. To produce 70.2 million gallons of ethanol per year, our ethanol plant needs approximately 23.5 million bushels of corn, or approximately 65,000 bushels of corn per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. 
    The price at which we purchase corn depends on prevailing market prices. Increases in the price of corn significantly increase our cost of goods sold. If these increases in cost of goods sold are not offset by corresponding increases in the prices we receive from the sale of our products, these increases in cost of goods sold can have a significant negative impact on our financial performance. 
Corn prices were higher during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to increased demand which outpaced supply. On November 9, 2021, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") released a report estimating the 2021 national corn crop at approximately 15.1 billion bushels, up 7% from last year's production, with yields averaging 177 bushels per acre. The USDA also reported area harvested for grain at 85.1 million acres, up 3% from 2020. However, yields in our local area have been lower due to dry weather which could have a negative affect on the price we pay for our corn. Weather conditions, world supply and demand, current and anticipated corn stocks, agricultural policy and other factors can all contribute to volatility in corn prices. 
Utilities
Natural Gas
    Natural gas is an important input to our manufacturing process. We use natural gas to dry our distillers grains products to moisture contents at which they can be stored for longer periods. This allows the distillers grains we produce to be transported greater distances to serve broader livestock markets. 

    We have access to an existing Northern Natural Gas Company ("NNG") interstate natural gas pipeline located approximately one half mile from our ethanol plant. On July 30, 2018, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with NNG which has an effective date of November 1, 2019 and extends the term through October 31, 2024. Under the amendment, we will pay NNG the tariff rate in effect from time to time for natural gas. NNG has allocated a minimum quantity of 5,000 dekatherms ("dth") of natural gas per day.
    We entered into a natural gas service agreement with CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., d.b.a. CenterPoint Energy Minnesota Gas (“CenterPoint”). CenterPoint constructed a pipeline for us from the Northern Natural Gas Company Town Border Station. We purchase all of our natural gas requirements from CenterPoint's pipeline. Under the agreement, CenterPoint will continue to operate and maintain the pipeline to deliver natural gas to us under applicable tariffs.  In addition, for all natural gas volumes delivered, we will pay certain delivery charges per dth delivered during each contract year subject to annual adjustments as permitted by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to match actual costs with the value recovered in the rates. In the event we do not purchase the minimum volume of 1,400,000 dth during each contract year, we will pay the difference between the actual delivery volume for the period and the minimum volume multiplied by the applicable rate. The initial term of the agreement will continue until October 31, 2029 and will automatically renew for additional five year terms unless terminated by either party upon written notice given at least 12 months prior to the end of the term upon an occurrence of certain events of default as set forth therein.
    We also have an energy management agreement with Kinect Energy Group f/k/a U.S. Energy Services, Inc. (“Kinect”) pursuant to which Kinect is providing us with the necessary natural gas management services. Some of their services may include an economic comparison of distribution service options, negotiation and minimization of interconnect costs, submission of the necessary pipeline “tap” request, supplying the plant with and/or negotiating the procurement of natural gas, development and implementation of a price risk management plan targeted at mitigating natural gas price volatility and maintaining profitability, providing consolidated monthly invoices that reflect all natural gas costs. In addition, Kinect is responsible for reviewing and reconciling all invoices. In exchange for these services, we pay Kinect a monthly retainer fee. 
We do not anticipate any problems securing the natural gas we need to operate our ethanol plant during our 2022 fiscal year. 
Electricity
On June 28, 2007, we entered into an agreement for electric service with Redwood Electric Cooperative, Inc., (the "Cooperative") for the purchase and delivery of electric power and energy necessary to operate our ethanol plant. Upon execution of the agreement, we became a member of the Cooperative and are bound by its articles of incorporation and bylaws. This agreement remained in effect until September 19, 2017, when our new agreement with the Cooperative to purchase all of the electric power that we require for our ethanol plant became effective. The new agreement remains in effect until January 1, 2023. The agreement automatically renews for additional five year periods unless we give at least one year's written notice of termination prior to the expiration of the then current term or if the agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. For the electric power provided, in addition to certain penalties and adjustments, we will pay the following rates: (i) a facility charge based on the then current net plant value; (ii) a per KWh energy charge at the then current wholesale rate including distribution losses and margin requirements; (iii) an additional demand charge for the entire monthly demand (kW) that is coincident to the peak demand; and (iv) an additional delivery charge for the entire monthly demand (kW) that is coincident to the peak demand. The rates are updated annually. The rates set forth in the agreement terminate in the event that our firm non-coincident peak demand is less that 2,000 kW for twelve consecutive months or our rolling twelve month non-coincident load factor is less than 60% for twelve consecutive months. Upon termination of the agreement by either party for any reason, we remain responsible for payment of the facility charge for what would have been the remaining portion of the term. 
We do not anticipate any problems securing the electricity we need to operate our ethanol plant during our 2022 fiscal year. 
Water
    We require a significant supply of water. We currently obtain water from a high capacity well and through a pipeline that pipes water from a nearby rock quarry. We acquired all of the necessary permits required for our water usage. Much of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled back into the process. There are, however, certain areas of production where fresh water is needed. Those areas include the boiler makeup water and cooling tower water. Boiler makeup water is treated on-site to minimize all elements that will harm the boiler and recycled water cannot be used for this process. Cooling tower water is deemed non-contact water because it does not come in contact with the mash, and, therefore, can be regenerated back into the cooling tower process. The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation. This has the effect of lowering wastewater treatment costs. We have assessed our water needs and determined we have an adequate supply.    
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
    We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM, Inc. was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plant. We were granted a license by Butamax Advanced Biofuels, LLC ("Butamax") to use certain corn oil separation technology in exchange for payment of certain license fees. We amended our license arrangement with Butamax to provide for a one-time fee which was paid in December of 2020.
Seasonality Sales
    We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving and, as a result, increased gasoline demand. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. We also experience decreased distillers grains demand during the summer months due to natural depletion in the size of herds at cattle feed lots and when the animals are turned out to pasture or are slaughtered. Further, we expect some seasonality of demand for our corn oil since a major corn oil user is biodiesel plants which typically reduce production during the winter months. 
Working Capital
    We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate the ethanol plant. Our primary sources of working capital are cash generated by our operations and our Term Revolving Loan and our Revolving Line of Credit Loan with Compeer Financial, PCA ("Compeer"). At October 31, 2021, we had approximately $19,500,000 available 
to draw on our Term Revolving Loan and approximately $10,000,000 available to draw on our Revolving Line of Credit Loan, respectively. 

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
    As discussed above, we have a marketing agreement with RPMG for the marketing, sale and distribution of our ethanol and corn oil and have engaged CHS for marketing, selling and distributing our distillers dried grains with solubles. We expect to rely on RPMG for the sale and distribution of our ethanol and corn oil and CHS for the sale and distribution of our distillers dried grains with solubles. Therefore, although there are other marketers in the industry, we are highly dependent on RPMG and CHS for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of RPMG or CHS as our marketing agents could have a significant negative impact on our revenues. We market and sell our own distillers modified wet grains.
Federal Ethanol Supports and Governmental Regulation
Federal Ethanol Supports 
The ethanol industry is dependent on economic incentives to produce ethanol. One significant federal ethanol support is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain “advanced” renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
    The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA is required by statute to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligation ("RVO"). The statutory volumes and the EPA's RVOs for 2020 (in billion gallons) are as follows:

 | | Total Renewable Fuel | Portion of Volume Requirement That Can Be Met By Corn-based Ethanol
2020 | Statutory | 30.00 | 15.00 
EPA Rule 12/19/19 | 20.09 | 15.00 

    However, in December 2021, the EPA proposed to retroactively reduce the RVO for total renewable fuel for 2020 to 17.13 billion gallons. The portion that could be met by corn-based ethanol would be reduced to 12.5 billion for 2020. The EPA indicated that the reason for this retroactive proposed change was program and market challenges including from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the EPA proposed to set the RVO for total renewable fuel for 2021 to 18.52 billion gallons and for 2022 to 20.77 billion gallons. The portion that could be met by corn-based ethanol would be 13.32 billion for 2021 and would then increase to 15 billion gallons in 2022. The EPA also proposed to add a 250 million gallon supplemental obligation in 2022 and stated its intention to do the same for 2023. The public comment period for the proposed rules is open through February 4, 2022. 
Small refineries can petition the EPA annually for an exemption from their ethanol use requirements for the prior compliance year. The EPA granted significantly more small refinery waivers in 2018 and 2019 than in past years and did not reallocate the waived gallons to other refiners. These actions resulted in decreased ethanol demand which led to reduced market ethanol prices and negative operating margins in the ethanol industry. In January 2020, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that small refinery exemptions may only be granted to refineries that had secured them continuously each year since 2010. Consistent with this ruling, in September 2020, the EPA denied certain small refinery exemption petitions filed by oil refineries in 2020 seeking retroactive relief from their ethanol use requirements for prior years. However, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court partially reversed the decision finding that a small refinery may obtain a hardship exemption even if its earlier exemption had lapsed in one or more previous years. In December 2021, the EPA proposed to deny more than 60 small refinery 
exemption petitions for one or more compliance years between 2016 and 2021 on the grounds that the petitioners had failed to show that the EPA had a basis to approve them. 
In February 2010, the EPA issued additional regulations governing the RFS. These additional regulations have been called RFS2. The most controversial part of RFS2 involves what is commonly referred to as the lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the EPA adopted rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in greenhouse gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. RFS2 establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% greenhouse gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in greenhouse gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. However, RFS2 as adopted by the EPA provides that corn-based ethanol from modern ethanol production processes does meet the definition of a renewable fuel under the RFS program. Our ethanol plant was grandfathered into the RFS due to the fact that it was constructed prior to the effective date of the lifecycle greenhouse gas requirement and is not required to prove compliance with the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions. Certain provisions of RFS2 as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. 

Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. In recent years, the gasoline demand in the United States has been estimated at approximately 143 billion gallons. Assuming that this estimate is correct and that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol domestically would be approximately 14.3 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the “blending wall,” which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is not possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends such as E85 used in flex fuel vehicles. In addition, gasoline demand in 2020 was lower due to COVID-19.
     In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for use in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. Although there have been significant steps towards introduction of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles to meaningful market penetration by E15. Many states still have regulatory issues that hamper or prevent the sale of E15. In addition, sales of E15 may be limited because E15 is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. Previously, different gasoline blendstocks were required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which may prevent E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. In May of 2019, the EPA issued a final rule allowing the year-round sale of E15. However, in June of 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down this rule finding that the EPA had exceeded its authority.
    A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50, and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at retail stations. The increased use of blender pumps may increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost-effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the market.
In May 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") announced the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program which consists of up to $100 million in funding for grants to be used to increase the availability of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel fuels. Funds may be awarded to retailers such as fueling stations and convenience stores to assist in the cost of installation or upgrading of fuel pumps and other infrastructure. In October 2020, the USDA announced the first round of awards to recipients of $22 million worth of grants. To date, the USDA has awarded approximately $66.4 million to eligible projects.
Effect of Governmental Regulation 
The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations and increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted 
that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. For example, changes in the environmental regulations regarding the required oxygen content of automobile emissions could have an adverse effect on the ethanol industry. Additionally, any changes that are made to the ethanol plant or its operations must be reviewed to determine if amended permits need to be obtained in order to implement these changes. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $282,000 complying with environmental laws. 
Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are also subject to regulation by several other federal and state agencies including the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal and state regulations may change such that the costs of operating the plant may increase. 
    In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. On December 29, 2011, a federal district court in California ruled that the California LCFS was unconstitutional which halted implementation of the California LCFS. However, the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") appealed this court ruling and on September 18, 2013, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.    
Competition
Ethanol
We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, many of whom have greater resources than we do. Following the significant growth during 2005 and 2006, the ethanol industry has grown at a much slower pace. The Renewable Fuels Association estimates that there are approximately 210 ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with capacity to produce approximately 17.5 billion gallons of ethanol. 
Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. We have also experienced increased competition from oil companies who have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. Larger ethanol producers may be able to realize economies of scale that we are unable to realize. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. The ethanol industry is continuing to consolidate where a few larger ethanol producers are increasing their production capacities and are controlling a larger portion of the United States ethanol production. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operation margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. 
Following the acquisition of several plants by POET Biorefining from Flint Hill Resources earlier this year, the largest ethanol producers now include Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. The following table identifies the majority of the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their approximate production capacities.

                *According to information reported by the RFA on December 30, 2021    
    We face competition from ethanol produced outside of the United States, particularly from Brazil. Ethanol imports have been lower in recent years due to the increase by Brazil in 2013 of its domestic ethanol use requirement from 20% to 25% and the institution in 2017 of a quota and tariff on ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil which have likely decreased the amount of ethanol Brazil has available for export. The effect of the tariff has been mitigated somewhat by the adoption of a rate tariff quota that allowed 750 million liters of ethanol annually to be allowed into Brazil before the tariff applies. However, this rate tariff quota expired in December 2020. Although ethanol imports have decreased, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again that could negatively impact demand for ethanol produced in the United States which could result in lower operating margins.
Our ethanol plant also competes with producers of other gasoline additives having similar octane and oxygenate values as ethanol. Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and alternative ethanol production methods are also continually under development. The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to market other additives, to develop alternative products, and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. These companies also have sufficient resources to begin production of ethanol should they choose to do so.
A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While in the past there were a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been increased focus on developing these recharging stations which have made electric car technology more widely available. This additional competition from alternate sources could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
Distillers Grains 
    Our ethanol plant competes with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Distillers grains are primarily used as animal feed which replaces corn and soybean meal. As a result, distillers grains prices are impacted by corn and soybean prices. In addition, increased exports of distillers grains have positively affected demand and distillers grains prices. If distillers grains exports decline, it could result in an oversupply in the market causing distillers grains prices in the United States to decrease. 
Corn Oil Competition
    We compete with many ethanol producers for the sale of corn oil. Many ethanol producers have installed the equipment necessary to separate corn oil from the distillers grains they produce which has increased competition for corn oil sales and has resulted in lower market corn oil prices.
Employees 
We depend on our employees to operate our plant. While we face competition to attract and retain personnel with the necessary skills, we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of wages and benefits and our commitment to training and development. In addition, the safety of our employees is our highest priority. We have developed and enforce workplace safety policies and programs in order to maintain a high standard for performance in our operations and ensure the safety of our workers. As of October 31, 2021, we had 42 full-time employees. We do not expect the number of employees to materially change in the next twelve months.
