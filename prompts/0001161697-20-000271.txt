Item 1. BUSINESS.
Blockchain Generally

Distributed blockchain technology is a decentralized and encrypted ledger that is designed to offer a secure, efficient, verifiable, and permanent way of storing records and other information without the need for intermediaries. Blockchain technologies are being evaluated for a multitude of industries due to the belief in their ability to have a significant impact in many areas of business, finance, information management, and governance.
Company Overview

We are an early stage technology company focused on developing blockchain software platforms. Our plan is to develop or license intellectual property to build blockchain platforms for a variety of uses. Our initial efforts will focus on utilizing the intellectual property in two ways: to develop secure blockchain based supply chain and inventory control systems, and to develop a blockchain based trading platform in order to facilitate securities trading using either a fiat currency or cryptocurrency.

We plan to develop blockchain based supply chain and inventory control systems that will provide value to businesses across industries by optimizing inventory levels and production targets. For example, distribution companies will be able to utilize the blockchain software platform to control and organize their production and distribution networks. Further, hospital systems will be able to optimize patient care and product supply chains. Our goal in developing a blockchain based trading platform is to make securities trading easier, faster, and safer.

Competition

We expect the Company to compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on developing programming for the blockchain. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of the participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include “bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info”; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured. Several public companies (traded in the U.S. and Internationally), such as the following, may be considered to compete with us, although we believe there is no company, including the following, which engages in the same scope of activities as we do.

● | Blockchain Industries, Inc. (formerly Omni Global Technologies, Inc.)
● | DMG Blockchain Solutions

There is limited available information regarding our potential non-public competitors. The blockchain industry is a highly competitive and evolving industry and new competitors and/or emerging technologies could enter the market and affect our competitiveness in the future.

Government Regulation 

We may be subject to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations, some of which may apply to us as a result of our blockchain business.

Government regulation of blockchain is being actively considered by the United States federal government via several agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as similar entities in other countries. State government regulation also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Regulations may substantially change in the future and it is presently not possible to know how regulations will apply to our business, or when they will be effective. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws which may affect our activities.

Intellectual Property

As of April 30, 2019, we did not have any intellectual property. See, Subsequent Events.

Employees

As of April 30, 2019, we had no employees. Our officers provided services to our company on a contract basis as needed.

Corporate Information

We were incorporated in the State of Florida on April 8, 2013, with a fiscal year end of April 30th. Until June 2017, we had not established any business operations and had not achieved any revenues. Until then, we were in the process of identifying and evaluation feasible business opportunities in the consumer products and technologies industries. On December 4, 2017, the Company changed its name to “Black Cactus Global, Inc.”

A company continues to be deemed an “emerging growth company” until the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. Our first sale of common equity pursuant to an effective registration statement was during the three months ended October 31, 2013, and last day of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities was April 30, 2019. As a result, after April 30, 2019, we were no longer an “emerging growth company”.

In addition, the Company will issue an option for CMBC Limited to acquire additional shares at par value ($0.0001) per share up to 60% of any shares issued under the existing Securities Purchase Agreements with Bellridge. The closing of the License Agreement is subject to, among certain other conditions: (1) the Company obtaining a written agreement with Bellridge to increase its line of credit from $1,500,000 to $5,000,000; (2) the resignation of all the directors of the Company serving on the Board, during the quarterly period ended July 31, 2019, which was satisfied by the resignation of all of such directors on September 13, 2019, and the appointment of Lawrence P.
