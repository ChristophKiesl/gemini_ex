PFS serves as the “brand behind the brand” for companies seeking to increase order fulfillment and management and customer care efficiencies, drive customer engagement and growth, enter new markets or launch optimized sales channels. As a premier eCommerce order fulfillment provider, we offer scalable and cost-effective solutions for brand manufacturers, online retailers, and distributors across a wide range of industry segments to serve direct-to-consumer (DTC) and business-to-business (B2B) channels. We provide our clients with seamless and transparent solutions to support their business strategies, allowing them to focus on their core competencies. Leveraging our technology, expertise, and proven methodologies, we enable clients to develop and deploy new products and implement new business strategies or address new distribution channels rapidly and efficiently through our optimized solutions. Our clients engage us, both as a consulting partner to assist them in the design of a retail eCommerce solution, as well as a virtual and physical infrastructure partner to provide the mission-critical operations required to build and manage their business solution. Together, we not only help our clients define new ways of doing business, but also provide them the technology, physical infrastructure, and professional resources necessary to quickly implement their commerce objectives. We allow our clients to quickly and dramatically change how they “go-to-market” and service their customers.
Each client has a unique business model and unique strategic objectives that often require highly customized enterprise solutions. We support clients in a wide array of industries, including health, skincare, fragrance and beauty products, cosmetics, fashion apparel and accessories, footwear, luxury goods, consumer packaged goods, coins and collectibles, jewelry, housewares, computer and office products, among others. Clients turn to PFS for help in addressing a variety of business needs that include strategic consulting, customer care support, time-definite logistics, vendor managed inventory and integration, supply chain compression, cost model realignments, returns/reverse logistics, transportation management, and international expansion, among others. We also act as a constructive agent of change, providing clients the ability to alter their current distribution model, establish direct relationships with end-customers and reduce the overall time and costs associated with existing distribution channel strategies, while improving customer experience via value-added distribution solutions such as gift-wrapping and product personalization. Our clients are seeking DTC and B2B solutions that will provide them with dynamic supply chain and outsourcing efficiencies, while ultimately delivering a world-class, branded customer service experience.
Our value proposition is to serve as a well-integrated extension of our clients’ enterprises by delivering superior solutions that drive optimal customer experiences. For all the brands we serve, we strive to increase and enhance sales and market growth, bolster customer satisfaction and customer retention and drive costs out of the business through operations and technology related efficiencies. As both a virtual and a physical infrastructure for our clients’ businesses, we embrace their brand values, strategic objectives and operational processes. By utilizing our services, our clients are able to: 
Quickly Capitalize on Market Opportunities. We offer a collection of solutions focused on helping clients quickly assess opportunities that respond to the changing world of technology and assisting clients in harnessing innovation and brand experience through lean start-up methodologies. Our solutions empower clients to rapidly implement their supply chain and commerce strategies and take advantage of opportunities by utilizing our readily available advanced technology and physical infrastructure which facilitate a quick integration and implementation. The solution is designed to allow our clients to deliver consistent, quality service as transaction volumes grow and handle daily and seasonal peak periods. Our international locations allow our clients to expand the global reach of their products. 
Elevate the Customer Experience. We enable our clients to provide their customers with a high-touch, positive buying experience, thereby maintaining and promoting brand loyalty. We create omni-channel commerce experiences designed to fit into and fuel a connected digital ecosystem. Our eCommerce solutions communicate seamlessly with client stores and varying applications. Through our use of advanced technology, we help our clients respond directly to customer inquiries by email, phone or live chat and assist them with online ordering and product information. We offer our clients a “world-class” level of service, including high-touch customer care services, detailed Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) reporting, and exceptional order accuracy. Our technology platform is designed to ensure high levels of reliability and fast response times for our clients’ customers. Because of our technology, our clients benefit from being able to offer the latest in traditional customer communication and auto-response technology to their customers. Using data, we create customer relationship-building insights that drive both strategy and action. Our fulfillment facilities are designed for efficient multi-brand operations with an emphasis on creating branded fulfillment experiences featuring custom packaging, gift-wrapping, extensive personalization options and build-to-order and build-to-stock kitting and/or secondary packaging. 
Minimize Investment and Improve Operating Efficiencies. One of the most significant benefits that outsourcing provides is the ability to transform fixed costs into variable costs. By eliminating the need to invest in a fixed capital infrastructure, our clients’ costs typically become more directly correlated with volume increases or declines. Further, as volume increases drive the demand for greater infrastructure or capacity, we are able to quickly deploy additional resources. As we provide services to multiple clients, we are able to offer our clients economies of scale and resulting cost efficiencies that they may not have been able to obtain on their own. Additionally, because of the large number of daily transactions we process, we have been able to justify investments in levels of automation, security surveillance, quality control processes, and transportation carrier interfaces that are typically outside the scale of investment that our clients might be able to cost-justify on their own. 
Access a Complete Order Fulfillment Platform. We provide our clients with access to a technology platform featuring best-of-breed DTC and B2B order processing technologies together in a single, integrated, Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) certified order to cash offering. Powered by leading enterprise class software solutions, our order to cash platform is integrated into a variety of leading industry eCommerce platforms and supporting technology components and services. Built to accelerate the implementation process, the technology ecosystem allows for flexible integrations with other technology providers and client systems. 
PFS provides the operational activities required and expected of the world's leading brands. Our solutions support DTC, B2B, and retail sales channels. We have DTC and B2B experience in customizing solutions to meet the unique nuances of our clients’ internal finance, customer care, supply chain, and omni-channel operations. With approximately 2.3 million square feet of leased distribution space and proven ability to maintain approximately 1,100 contact center employees across two continents, we have the global infrastructure to meet the operational needs of our eCommerce and traditional B2B clients.
The majority of our clients are the merchants of record for the orders we process through our infrastructure on their behalf. For these clients, we do not own the inventory or the resulting accounts receivable but provide commerce solutions and other services for these client-owned assets.
For some of our clients, we are the merchant of record for the orders we process through our infrastructure. Depending on the terms under these arrangements, we record service fee revenue, may own the accounts receivable and inventory and we 
may be compensated for all or a portion of our services through the resulting profit margin. In some of these client relationships, we purchase the inventory as the product is delivered to our facility. In other of these client relationships, the client retains ownership of inventory in our facility and we purchase and sell the inventory simultaneously with each individual customer sales transaction. In all of these cases, we seek inventory financing from our clients in the form of extended terms, working capital programs or marketing funds to help offset the working capital requirements that follow accounts receivable and inventory ownership.
Order Fulfillment
We design advanced distribution operations that streamline our clients’ supply chain process and offer a flexible fulfillment model. We differentiate ourselves through the value-added services we provide and creating branded solutions – more than the brown corrugated box. Our distribution centers are located in the Memphis, Tennessee area, Dallas, Texas, Las Vegas, Nevada, Toronto, Canada, Southampton, United Kingdom, and Liege, Belgium to provide strategically located fulfillment throughout North America and Europe.
Advanced Distribution Facilities and Infrastructure. An integral part of our solution is the warehousing and distribution of our clients’ inventory. We receive client inventory in our distribution centers, verify shipment accuracy, unpack and audit packages. We generally make inventory available for sale within one business day of unloading. We pick, pack and ship customer orders and can provide customized packaging, customized monogramming, personalized laser engraving, high volume shrink packaging, inserts and promotional literature for distribution with customer orders. For many clients, we provide gift-wrapping services including unit level gifting, customized gift-wrapping paper, ribbon, gift-box and gift-messaging.
Our distribution facilities contain computerized sortation equipment, flexible mobile pick-to-light carts, powered material handling equipment and scanning and bar-coding systems. Our distribution facilities include several advanced technology enhancements, such as radio frequency technology in product receiving processing to ensure accuracy, as well as an automated package routing and a lighted paperless order fulfillment system. Our advanced distribution systems provide us with the capability to warehouse an extensive number of stock keeping units (“SKUs”), ranging from large high-end electronics to small cosmetic compacts. Our facilities are flexibly configured to process B2B and DTC orders from the same central location.
In addition to our advanced distribution systems, our proprietary pick-to-light carts, stationary pick-to-light areas and conveyor system controls provide real time productivity reporting, thereby providing our management team with the tools to implement and manage to productivity standards. This combination of computer-controlled equipment provides the tight integration of our pick-to-light systems and mass sortation capabilities. This unique combination of technologies ensures high order accuracy for each and every customer order.
We are able to take advantage of a variety of shipping and delivery options, which range from next day service to zone skipping, to optimize transportation costs. Our facilities and systems are equipped with multi-carrier functionality, allowing us to integrate with all leading package carriers and regional freight providers while providing a comprehensive freight and transportation management offering to our clients.
We offer reverse logistics management services, including issuing return authorizations, return carrier shipping labels, receipt of product, crediting customer accounts and disposition of returned product. We also leverage strategic partnerships to provide our clients with access to distributed returns centers that collect, consolidate, report on and forward returned product to our central facilities allowing us to accelerate credits to our clients’ customers, reduce freight costs for our client, provide environmentally friendly options, improve customer service and reduce complexity and cost in our facilities from handling inbound returns.
Facility Operations and Management. Our facilities management service offering includes distribution facility design and optimization, business process reengineering and ongoing staffing and management. Our expertise in supply chain management, logistics and client-centric fulfillment operations can provide our clients with cost reductions, process improvements and technology-driven efficiencies.
Kitting and Assembly Services. Our expanded kitting and assembly services enable our clients to reduce the time and costs associated with managing multiple suppliers, warehousing hubs and light manufacturing partners. As a single source provider, we provide the advantage of convenience, accountability and speed. Our kitting and assembly services include light assembly, specialized kitting and supplier-consigned inventory hubs either in our distribution facilities or co-located elsewhere. We also offer customized light manufacturing and supplier relationship management.
Pop-Up Distribution Centers. Leveraging our CloudPick℠ solution, temporary fulfillment centers allow our clients’ eCommerce fulfillment networks to flex during peak periods with all the benefits of regional distribution nodes, without the long-
term capital costs. We can deploy full pick-pack-ship operations within weeks that run off a simple Wi-Fi network and our proprietary distributed order management technology. Deployed into any real estate space, this solution allows for temporary forward stock allocation to alleviate volume from the primary fulfillment center, shorten delivery times and lower shipping costs.
Fulfillment-as-a-Service. PFS has developed and deployed technology products that facilitate the omni-channel shopping experience. Our cloud-based RetailConnectSM Store Edition is designed to streamline the pick/pack/ship operation within a retail store. Our cloud-based solution allows retailers the ability to offer ship from store and Buy Online, Pick-up In Store (BOPIS) quickly and accurately, transforming a brick-and-mortar store into an efficient, omni-channel hub which optimizes inventory and improves customer satisfaction.
Order to Cash 
Our order to cash service provides our clients with distributed order orchestration and payment processing. Our order to cash service features an Oracle-based, custom, scalable Distributed Order Management (“DOM”) technology platform built for DTC and B2B order processing with a variety of fully-integrated payment processing and fraud management platforms and technologies. Our order to cash service provides interfaces that allow for real-time information retrieval, including information on inventory, sales orders, shipments, delivery, purchase orders, warehouse receipts, customer history, accounts receivable and credit lines. These solutions are integrated with our customer contact centers, allowing for the processing of orders through shopping cart, phone, fax, mail, email, live chat and other order receipt methods. As the information backbone for our total supply chain solution, our order to cash service can be used on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with our other business infrastructure offerings. In addition, for the B2B market, our service offering provides a variety of order receipt methods that facilitate commerce within various stages of the supply chain. Our service provides the ability for both our clients and their customers to track the status of orders at any time. Our services are transparent to our clients’ customers and are seamlessly integrated with our clients’ internal system platforms and websites. By synchronizing these activities, we can capture and provide critical customer information, including:
•Statistical measurements critical to creating a quality customer experience, containing real-time order status, order exceptions, back-order tracking, allocation of product based on timing of online purchase and business rules, the ratio of customer inquiries to purchases, average order sizes and order response time;
•B2B supply chain management information critical to evaluating inventory positioning, for the purpose of improving inventory turns, and assessing product flow-through and end-user demand;
•Reverse logistics information, including customer response and reason for the return or rotation of product and desired customer action; and
•Detailed marketing information about what was sold and to whom it was sold, by location and preference.
Technology Collaboration. We have created a suite of technology services that enable buyers and suppliers to fully automate their business transactions within their supply chain using our order management interfaces. Our collaboration technologies operate in an open systems environment and feature the use of industry-standard JavaScript Object Notation ("JSON") or Extensible Markup Language (“XML”) and Service-Oriented Architecture (“SOA”) web services, enabling customized eCommerce solutions with minimal changes to a client’s systems or our systems. The result is a faster implementation process. We also support information exchange methods, such as Applicability Statement 2 (“AS2”), Secure File Transfer Protocol (“SFTP”), Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”), Message Queue Series (“MQ Series”), Application Link Enabling (“ALE”), and Representational State Transfer / Simple Object Access Protocol (“REST/SOAP”) over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (“HTTPS”).
Information Management. We have the ability to communicate with and transfer information to and from our clients through a wide variety of technology services, including real-time web service enabled data interfaces, file transfer methods and electronic data interchange. Our distributed order orchestration systems are designed to capture, store and electronically forward to our clients critical information regarding customer inquiries and orders, product shipments, inventory status (for example, levels of inventory on hand, on back order, on purchase order and inventory due dates to our warehouse), payment reconciliation product returns and other information. Our clients are able to utilize inventory and order information for use in analyzing sales and marketing trends and introducing new products. We also offer customized reports and data analyses based upon specific client needs to assist them in their budgeting.
Payments. Protecting our clients’ brand with secure payment processing and fraud management services is critical to a successful operation. We also provide flexible global payment options as well as gift cards, B2B invoicing and VAT services.
Our payment services are divided into two major financial management areas: 1) billing, credit, collection and cash application services for B2B clients and 2) fraud review, chargeback management and processing and settlement of credit card services for DTC clients.
Business-to-Business Financial Management. For B2B clients, we offer full-service accounts receivable management and collection capabilities, including the ability to generate customized invoices in our clients’ names. We assist clients in reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding, while minimizing costs associated with maintaining an in-house collections staff. We offer electronic credit services in the format of EDI and XML communications direct from our clients to their vendors, suppliers and retailers.
Direct-to-Consumer Financial Management. For DTC clients, we offer secure credit card processing related services for orders made via a client web site or through our customer contact center. We offer manual credit card order review as an additional level of fraud protection. We also calculate sales taxes, goods and services taxes or value added taxes, if applicable, for numerous taxing authorities and on a variety of products. Using third-party leading-edge fraud protection services and risk management systems, we can offer high levels of security and reduce the level of risk for client transactions.
Customer Care
Our internal contact center operations are focused on providing essential services such as order entry, returns authorization, product inquiry and order tracking. Our unique multi-lingual capabilities are possible through our strategically placed management locations in the United States (“US”), Belgium, United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and Canada, as well as partnerships delivering multi-lingual capability in Mexico. We have also deployed technology which allows for full customer care capabilities to be deployed for agents in a work from home ("WFH") capacity, which has greatly increased our access to skilled staff while reducing attrition. 
Customer Service Application. Through our web enabled iCommerce Agent application, our unique technology leverages the client’s website by wrapping the Customer Service Application around the existing website. Using iCommerce Agent, agents provide customer service functions, such as placing orders, checking order status, facilitating returns, initiating upsell and cross sell, managing escalations and gathering “voice of the customer” information to help our clients evolve with their customers’ changing needs. iCommerce Agent is fully integrated into the client’s website, our data analytics platform, and our order processing system, allowing full visibility into customer history and customer trends. Through this fully integrated system, we are able to provide a complete customer care solution in a contact center or on a license basis to our clients’ owned or outsourced contact centers.
Customer Assistance. An important feature of customer assistance is the ability for the customer to communicate with a live customer service representative. Our contact center services utilize features that integrate voice, email, standard mail and live chat communications to respond to and handle customer inquiries. Our customer care representatives answer various questions, acting as virtual representatives of our clients’ organization, regarding order status, shipping, billing, returns and product information and availability as well as a variety of other questions. We utilize technology that allows us to route each customer contact automatically to the appropriate customer care representative who is individually trained in the clients’ business and products.
Our contact centers are flexibly designed so that our customer care representatives can handle either several different clients and products in a shared agent environment, thereby creating economy of scale benefits for our clients, or through a highly customized dedicated agent support model that provides the ultimate customer experience and brand reinforcement.
Quality Monitoring. Quality is essential in our client solutions. As representatives of our clients, our customer care representatives must adhere to the unique quality standards of each client for each contact type. We continually monitor the quality of our customer care representatives against each client quality standard and use the results to provide agent-level feedback to continually improve the customer care experience. Clients may participate in the quality process by remotely listening to calls, assisting in the grading of recorded calls and providing ongoing direction to improve quality standards through our calibration process.
Customer Self-Help. With the need for efficiency and cost optimization for many of our clients, we have integrated secure interactive voice response (“IVR”) as another option for customer contacts. IVR creates an “electronic workforce” with virtual agents that can assist customers with information at any time of the day or night. IVR allows for our clients’ customers to deal interactively with our order payment system to handle basic customer inquiries, such as account balance, order status, shipment status and customer satisfaction surveys. The inclusion of IVR in our service offering allows us to offer a cost-effective way to handle high volume, low complexity calls.
INDUSTRY INFORMATION AND COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
Industry Overview
Business activities in the public and private sectors continue to operate in an environment of rapid technological advancement, increasing competition and continuous pressure to decrease costs by improving operating and supply chain efficiency. We currently see the following trends within the industry:
•Manufacturers strive to restructure their supply chains to maximize efficiency and reduce costs in both B2B and DTC markets, and to create a variable-cost supply chain able to support the multiple, unique needs of each of their initiatives, including traditional retail and eCommerce.
•Companies in a variety of industries seek outsourcing as a method to address one or more business functions that are not within their core business competencies, to reduce operating costs or to improve the speed or cost of implementation.
•Retailers, both traditional and eCommerce, partner with providers that offer them the most flexibility both short and long-term. However, many companies today seek to diversify their eCommerce operations across in-house capabilities and outsourced components on an à la carte basis.
•The “seamless customer experience” is a major industry trend that retailers and brand manufacturers are embracing to differentiate and remain relevant to a more sophisticated consumer. As consumers desire a shopping experience that blends sales channels, the integration and flexibility of front and back-end systems and operations becomes more critical to retailers and manufacturers.
•Consumer branded manufacturers and retailers are focused on driving improvements in their online presence through incremental investments in their website presence and infrastructure to support evolving consumer buying patterns and requirements. 
Supply Chain Management Trend
As companies maintain focus on improving their businesses and balance sheet financial ratios, significant efforts and investments continue to be made in identifying ways to maximize supply chain efficiency and extend supply chain processes. Working capital financing, vendor managed inventory, supply chain visibility software solutions, distribution channel skipping, direct-to-consumer eCommerce sales initiatives and complex upstream supply chain collaborative technology are products that manufacturers seek to help them achieve greater supply chain efficiency. Certain clients were impacted by supply chain issues in 2022 which made our ability to offer omni-channel solutions, which could optimize retail inventory for eCommerce orders, even more important. Additionally, our distribution center expansion into Las Vegas allows our clients to utilize a multi-node distribution strategy by leveraging multiple operations within PFS, which often shortens delivery times for product to our facilities as well as improves delivery times from our fulfillment network to the end consumer.
A key business challenge facing many manufacturers and retailers as they evaluate their supply chain efficiency is determining how the trend toward increased omni-channel business activity will impact their traditional DTC commerce business models. Ship-from-store, pick-up-in-store, return-to-store and other omni-channel capabilities are becoming increasingly important processes to accommodate. We believe manufacturers will look to outsource their non-core competency functions to support this modified business model. We believe companies will continue to strategically plan for the impact that technology advancements will have on their traditional commerce business models and their existing technology and infrastructure capabilities. Additionally, B2B opportunities exist as companies look to leverage the technology and enhanced customer experience that currently exists within eCommerce channels, or co-locate their inventory and fulfill retail wholesale and DTC orders from a single location.
Outsourcing Trend
In response to growing competitive pressures and technological innovations, we believe many companies, both large and small, are focusing their critical resources on the core competencies of their business and utilizing eCommerce service providers to accelerate their business plans in a cost-effective manner and perform non-core business functions. Outsourcing can provide many key benefits, including the ability to:
•Enter new business markets or geographic areas rapidly;
•Increase flexibility to meet changing business conditions and demand for products and services;
•Enhance customer satisfaction and gain competitive advantage;
•Reduce capital and personnel investments and convert fixed investments to variable costs;
•Improve operating performance and efficiency; and
•Capitalize on skills, expertise and technology infrastructure that would otherwise be unavailable or expensive given the scale of the business.
Typically, many outsourcing service providers are focused on a single function, channel or geography, such as information technology, contact center management, credit card processing, warehousing or package delivery, etc. This focus creates several challenges for companies looking to outsource more than one of these functions, including the need to manage multiple outsourcing service providers, to share information with service providers and to integrate that information into their internal systems. Additionally, the delivery of these multiple services must be transparent to the customer so the client maintains brand recognition and customer loyalty. Furthermore, traditional commerce outsourcers are frequently providers of domestic-only services versus international solutions. As a result, companies requiring global solutions must establish additional relationships with other outsourcing parties.
Another vital point for major brand name companies seeking to outsource is the protection of their brand. When looking for an outsourcing partner to provide order fulfillment solutions, brand name companies must find a company that can provide the same quality performance and superior experience their customers expect from their brands. Working with an outsourcing partner requires finding a partner that can maintain the consistency of their brand image, which is one of the most valuable intangible assets that recognized brand name companies possess.
Competition
We compete with eCommerce focused order fulfillment providers such as Radial and GEODIS (formerly OHL), as well as, depending on the client’s retail and/or supply chain strategy, Saddle Creek Logistics, Maersk (formerly Visible Supply Chain Management), Capacity Logistics, FedEx Supply Chain, GXO, OceanX, Kuehne + Nagel, and other “pure-play” fulfillment or contact center providers.
We face competition from many different sources depending upon the type and range of services requested by a potential client. Many other companies offer one or more of the same services we provide on an individual basis. Our competitors include vertical outsourcers, which are companies that offer a single function solution. We compete with transportation logistics providers, known in the industry as 3PL’s and 4PL’s (third or fourth party logistics providers), who offer product management functions as an ancillary service to their primary transportation services. In many instances, PFS competes with the in-house operations of our potential clients. Occasionally, the operations departments of potential clients believe they can perform the same services we do, at similar quality levels and costs, while others are reluctant to outsource business functions that involve direct customer contact. We cannot be certain we will be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors in the future.
Although many of our competitors offer one or more of our services, we believe our primary competitive advantage is our ability to offer branded eCommerce operations, helping brands differentiate their DTC channel with consumer experiences that match their brand values.
We also compete on the basis of many other important additional factors, including:
•vertical industry expertise;
•bundled service offerings;
•omni-channel strategy; 
•design and implementation experience;
•operating performance and reliability;
•ease of implementation and integration;
•experience of the people required to successfully and efficiently design and implement solutions;
•experience operating similar solutions dynamically;
•global reach; and
•price. 
We believe we can compete favorably with respect to many of these factors. However, the market for our services is competitive and continually evolving, which will require PFS to continue to innovate and invest in its operations to be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.
COMPANY INFORMATION
Clients and Marketing
Our target clients include branded manufacturers, online retailers and leading consumer goods brands looking to quickly and efficiently implement or enhance online and offline business initiatives and operations, adapt their digital strategies or introduce new products, programs or geographies, without the burden of modifying or expanding their technology, customer care, supply chain and logistics infrastructure. Our solutions are applicable to a multitude of industries and business types and we have provided solutions for such companies as:
L’Oréal USA (health & beauty), ON (sporting goods/apparel), Thrive Causemetics (health & beauty), Kendra Scott (jewelry), PANDORA (jewelry), Moleskine (stationery), Champion (apparel), Procter & Gamble (consumer packaged goods), Shiseido Americas (health & beauty), The United States Mint (collectible coins), and Wimbledon (sports & lifestyle), among many others.
We target potential clients through an extensive integrated marketing program comprised of a variety of direct marketing techniques, email marketing initiatives, trade event participation, search engine marketing, public relations, social media, thought leadership, and a targeted outbound tele-sales lead generation model. We have also developed a global business development methodology which allows us to effectively showcase our various commerce service solutions and products. We also pursue strategic marketing alliances with consulting firms, private equity firms, technology companies, and other logistics providers to increase market awareness and generate referrals and customer leads.
Because of the highly complex nature of the solutions we provide, our clients demand significant competence and experience from a variety of different business disciplines during the sales cycle. As such, we often utilize a member of our executive team to lead the design and proposal development of each potential new client we choose to pursue. The executive is supported by a select group of highly experienced individuals from our professional services and operations groups with specific industry knowledge of, or experience with, the solutions development process. We employ a team of highly trained implementation managers whose responsibilities include the oversight and supervision of client projects and maintaining high levels of client satisfaction during the transition process between the various stages of the sales cycle and steady state operations.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonality due to our client mix and their increased business volumes which are highest in our fourth quarter which coincides with the holiday retail peak season. We cannot predict the volume of sales of our clients or the impact of such seasonality of our clients or the sales they will implement during such peak season nor those of any future client business. We expect this seasonality to continue, or possibly increase in the future, which may cause fluctuations in our business operations and operating results. Increased online buying due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions drove substantially increased fulfillment volume starting in 2020 and sustaining through 2022. 
Concentration of Clients
During 2022, two clients each represented more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues. These clients each represented $34.7 million, or 12%, of total revenues. During 2021, two clients each represented more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues. These clients represented $37.6 million, or 14%, and $31.6 million, or 11%, of total revenues. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, one client exceeded 10% of the Company’s total accounts receivable at each period end. 
Human Capital Resources
Workforce Composition and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our business is operated by a diverse and global workforce, with employees in the following key geographies as of December 31, 2022:

 | Workforce Totals

We believe that providing a diverse workplace that promotes mutual respect and inclusion for all employees is critical to our business success and to driving innovation and growth. Since 2018, all U.S. employees were trained on diversity and inclusion. In 2019, this training was expanded to our non-U.S. employees and managers. In 2020, we launched an expanded Diversity & Inclusion effort and hired a firm to help develop a phased approach to increase diversity and ensure inclusion. As part of this process, the Company is engaging its workforce and seeking feedback from various groups within the Company, including, but not limited to, women, African Americans, and LGBTQ employees, to better determine if there are areas within the Company that warrant changes. In 2021, we reviewed the data from the Organizational Culture Index with business leaders. We continue to work through the phased approach and believe this is an ongoing effort that will drive permanent change in our Company and our practices.

In the U.S., Canada and India, we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and while our European subsidiaries are not a party to a collective-bargaining agreement, certain of them are required to comply with certain rules agreed upon by their employee Works Councils.
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention. 
We are focused on attracting the best employees, recognizing and rewarding their performance. The future success of our business initiatives relies heavily on our employees and in recruiting, hiring and training large numbers of skilled employees, and obtaining large numbers of hourly employees and temporary staff during peak periods for distribution and call center operations is critical to our ability to provide high quality services. To attract talented and experienced employees, we utilize multiple online search tools, specialized recruiting firms and temporary resourcing firms, as well as, an employee referral program to ensure a varied outreach approach for candidates.
Compensation, Benefits and Wellness.
We aim to offer marketable and competitive compensation and benefits to our employees relative to our industry and size. Varying by level, our compensation strategy is built around providing a mix of salary or hourly pay, cash based short-term incentives, and equity based long-term incentives to employees. In addition, we offer a comprehensive suite of health and retirement benefits, including medical, dental and prescription drug coverage, as well as paid parental leave, and 401(k) matching contributions. We have also instituted a Wellness Program to foster employee health, wellness, and engagement, which program includes fitness challenges and classes. We have attempted to maintain our Wellness Program with online course offerings for the majority of our employees that work from home. For employees based in the distribution centers, we provide free vaccines, and mobile health units (e.g. dental and mammograms).
Government Regulation
We are subject to significant and complex governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and internationally, which requires and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance and may, depending on specific facts and circumstances, impact our competitive position. 
Health and Safety
Our distribution center employees provide essential services to keep goods flowing to our clients' customers. Their protection and safety is important to us, and we are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees, temporary employees, contractors and visitors. We expect all employees, temporary employees, contractors and visitors to share in this commitment for the mutual benefit of everyone. With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the continuing and varied effects of the same, we began using a combination of protective measures and virtual communications to maintain a safe workplace environment including maintaining social distancing when possible. We continue to implement the recommended Center for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) guidelines in our distribution facilities. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
We recognize our responsibility to reduce environmental impact from our operations. We believe that solidifying our commitment to ESG efforts is a natural integration into our long-term corporate strategy and will enable us to better serve our stakeholders. In 2022, we entered a partnership with 3R Sustainability to develop a comprehensive Sustainability and ESG program. Through this partnership, we will:
•Identify and prioritize relevant ESG topics through a materiality assessment
•Establish a Sustainability Plan and ESG Strategic Roadmap
•Develop ESG reporting referencing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) frameworks
•Support the communications efforts around our ESG program
•Strategize in alignment with industry best practices and frameworks (SASB, TCFD and CDP)
Consumer and Data Protection Laws
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign consumer protection laws and data privacy laws, protecting our customers’ personally identifiable information and other non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices to name a few. Moreover, there is a trend toward regulations requiring companies to provide consumers with greater information regarding, and greater control over, how their personal data is used, and requiring notification when unauthorized access to such data occurs. Furthermore, the growth and demand for online commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens and greater penalties on online companies with online operations. 
These laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines and other penalties. For example, many states and foreign countries currently require us to notify each of our clients or customers who are affected by any data security breach (as such term may be defined by jurisdiction) in which an unauthorized person, such as a computer hacker, could obtain customer information. Nonetheless, we may be subject to data incidents for which, though not required to do so by law, we may disclose to our clients and customers under certain contractual obligations and/or data privacy agreements. In addition, several jurisdictions, including foreign countries, have adopted privacy-related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited email promotions, commonly known as “spam,” that impose significant monetary and other penalties for violations. 
In an effort to comply with these laws, internet service providers may increasingly block legitimate marketing emails. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and a time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms and training to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules in the future which could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.
As we receive, store and process personal information and other customer data in connection with our services, and in some cases we are deemed a controller of data, we are required to comply with numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, access, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information, personal data and other client data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules. Specifically, we are subject to the European Union (“E.U.”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and applicable national implementing legislation of the GDPR, and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation and U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, “U.K. GDPR”). 
The GDPR/U.K. GDPR imposes stringent data protection requirements and, where we are acting as a controller, includes requirements to provide detailed disclosures about how personal data is collected and processed, among many other requirements, along with complying with the principle of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures and audit. Where we act as a processor and process personal data on behalf of our clients, we are required to execute mandatory data processing clauses with those customers and maintain a record of data processing, among other requirements under the GDPR/U.K. GDPR. Further, in compliance with GDPR, we have adopted and transitioned to the European Commission’s new standard contractual clauses (“New SCCs”) to govern data transfers outside of the EU and have been updating our contracts to reference the New SCCs. 
Additionally, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which came into effect in 2020 and increases privacy rights for California consumers and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for security breaches that may increase the likelihood of, and the risks associated with, security breach litigation. Additionally, in November 2020, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which expands the CCPA significantly, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Many of the CPRA’s provisions became effective on January 1, 2023. Further, Virginia, Utah, Connecticut and Colorado have enacted state data protection and privacy laws requiring us to continually assess, update and review our policies for compliance. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, specifically, "We process, store and use personal information and other confidential data that we must safeguard the security and privacy of in compliance with laws that govern such data, including governmental regulations in the U.S., E.U., U.K. and Canada and we may be liable for an actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws, regulations and contractual obligations which could result in significant liability."
Further, with the U.K.’s exit from the E.U. (referred to as “Brexit”) and the subsequent Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “TCA”) entered into thereafter which became effective in May 2021 has resulted in continuing instability and uncertainty, adding cost and complexity to our operations and compliance efforts, including staffing and cross border supply chain implications. Brexit and the TCA has and may continue to contribute to volatility of currency exchange rates, including of the euro and British pound, issues with import and export controls, trade barriers, tariffs, and the movement of employees. The U.K. 
is an important geography for us and we have structured our privacy and data protection compliance program based on the GDPR. As a result of Brexit, we have implemented and introduced practices in the U.K. to comply with the U.K. GDPR and ensure compliance with the International Data Transfer Addendum to the New SCCs for transfers of personal data occurring from the U.K. to other countries on or before March 21, 2024. 
Lastly, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI-DSS”), a security standard applicable to companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, holders and transactions. We rely on vendors to handle PCI DSS matters and to ensure PCI-DSS compliance.
