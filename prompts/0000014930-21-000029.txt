The P&A segment includes engine parts and consumables, electrical products, boat parts and systems, and our distribution business. The Boat segment manufactures and distributes recreational boats and includes Business Acceleration, which operates Freedom Boat Club, dealer finance and ancillary services, and develops other emerging marine business models.
Refer to Note 6 – Segment Information and Note 3 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments and discontinued operations.
Propulsion Segment
The Propulsion segment, which we believe is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines, had 2020 net sales of $1,878.4 million. 

The Propulsion segment manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines, as well as propulsion-related controls, rigging, and propellers. The Propulsion segment primarily markets under the Mercury Marine, Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, and Mercury Diesel brands. These products are principally sold directly to independent boat builders, local, state, and foreign governments, and Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, the Propulsion segment sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers, and marine service centers.

Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 600 horsepower. Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, ProXS, SeaPro, and Race variations that include naturally aspirated and supercharged engines offered in a multitude of configurations designed for use in recreational, commercial, and racing applications. Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,750 horsepower. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States. Most of Mercury Marine's sterndrive and inboard engines are available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all are compliant with applicable U.S. state and federal environmental regulations. Mercury Marine's engines also comply with applicable global emissions and noise regulations.
In terms of innovation and technology development, the Propulsion segment continues to excel. In 2020, Mercury Marine launched the Bravo Four S forward-facing drive with Smart-Tow control system. Mercury Racing won an NMMA Innovation Award at the 2020 Miami International Boat Show for its 450R engine, and successfully launched the new 360APX competition four-stroke V8 outboard engine, designed for tunnel-boat racing competition on the Powerboat Formula 1 World Championship circuit. In December 2020, the Consumer Technology Association (CES) announced that Mercury's 1st Mate Marine Safety and Security System had been named a CES 2021 Innovation Awards Best of Innovation Honoree as part of an annual competition honoring outstanding design and engineering in consumer technology products. 

Mercury Marine produces gasoline outboard and sterndrive engines domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50, and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources engine components from a global supply base and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico. Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin. 
The Propulsion segment continues to be dedicated to its sustainability efforts and programs:
•In 2020, for the tenth consecutive year, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council (Council) awarded Mercury Marine a "Green Masters" designation under a program that measures a broad range of sustainability issues including energy and water conservation, waste management, community outreach, and education. 
•Mercury Marine's commitment to sustainability is highlighted in its 2019/2020 Sustainability Report, detailing specific goals Mercury Marine has met or exceeded related to energy, environment, products, and people. 
•Mercury Marine was named a winner of the 2020 Energy Efficiency Excellence Award by Wisconsin's Focus on Energy program. The award honors Wisconsin businesses, organizations, and communities that make outstanding efforts toward energy efficiency. 
In addition to marine engines and propulsion systems, Mercury Marine manufactures, markets, and supplies propulsion-related controls, rigging, and propellers. These products are designed for and sold to original equipment manufacturers (including Brunswick brands) and aftermarket retailers, distributors, and distribution businesses. 
Intercompany sales to our Boat segment represented approximately 14 percent of the Propulsion segment's sales in 2020. Domestic demand for the Propulsion segment's products is typically seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second quarter of the calendar year.
Parts & Accessories Segment
The P&A segment consists of the Engine Parts and Accessories and the Advanced Systems Group operating segments, which are aggregated and presented as a single reportable segment. P&A manufactures and markets parts and accessories, including engine parts and consumables, electrical products, and boat parts and systems, and supplies parts and accessories through the distribution business. These products are designed for and sold mostly to aftermarket retailers, distributors, and distribution businesses, as well as original equipment manufacturers (including Brunswick brands) for both marine and non-marine markets. The P&A segment had 2020 net sales of $1,508.8 million.
Branded Engine Parts and Accessories include consumables, such as engine oils and lubricants, and are sold under the Mercury, Mercury Precision Parts, Quicksilver, and Seachoice brands. Engine Parts and Accessories distribution businesses include Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Lankhorst Taselaar, BLA, and Payne's Marine Group. These businesses are leading distributors of both third party and Company marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. 
Brunswick formed the Advanced Systems Group (ASG) effective January 1, 2020. ASG includes the collection of brands 
acquired with Power Products in 2018 and certain other parts and accessories brands. ASG conducts business under the Ancor, Attwood, BEP, Blue Sea Systems, CZone, DelCity, Garelick, Lenco Marine, Marinco, Mastervolt, MotorGuide, NAUTIC-On, ParkPower, Progressive Industries, ProMariner, and Whale brand names. ASG products include marine electronics and control systems, instruments, trolling motors, fuel systems, and electrical systems, as well as specialty vehicle, mobile, and transportation aftermarket products. 
The P&A segment is similarly invested in developing innovative products. In 2020, Attwood launched several new products, including the all new Sahara Mk2 Automatic Bilge Pump Series, which won a 2020 IBEX Innovation Award in the Mechanical Systems Category. Progressive Industries developed a Portable Surge Protector Kit which protects recreational vehicles (RVs) from faulty pedestal wiring and dangerous power surges, and has been named the Aftermarket Product of the Year by the RV Industry Association (RVIA). The P&A businesses are also engaged in sustainability efforts, including focusing on electrification initiatives and reducing packaging.
P&A's manufacturing and distribution facilities are primarily located in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Intercompany sales to our Boat segment represented approximately 2 percent of the segment's sales in 2020. Domestic demand for the P&A segment's products is typically seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second quarter of the calendar year.
Boat Segment
The Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group, which manufactures and distributes recreational boats, and Business Acceleration, which provides innovative service models, shared access solutions, dealer services, and emerging technology to attract a wide range of customers to the marine industry. We believe that the Boat segment, which had net sales of $1,250.3 million during 2020, is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats.
The Boat segment manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability, including through its Business Acceleration initiatives; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes.
The Boat Group designs, manufactures, and markets the following boat brands and products: Sea Ray sport boats and cruisers; Bayliner sport cruisers and runabouts; Boston Whaler fiberglass offshore boats; Lund fiberglass fishing boats; Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund, and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats, and deck boats; Heyday tow/wake boats; and Thunder Jet heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat segment procures substantially all of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines, and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Propulsion segment. 
The Boat Group also includes Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which include Quicksilver, Uttern, and Rayglass (including Protector and Legend) that are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other parts and accessories supplied by the Propulsion and P&A segments. 
The Boat segment's manufacturing facilities include Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Washington, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal. The Boat Group also uses two contract manufacturing facilities in Poland.
The Boat Group continues to invest in new product development, innovation, and services, experiences, and products for the next generation of boaters. Sea Ray won a National Marine Manufacturers Association Innovation Award at the 2020 Miami International Boat Show for its groundbreaking SLX-R 400e outboard which debuted at CES earlier in the year. In addition, the Bayliner Trophy 22CC was named a finalist for the prestigious European Powerboat of the Year Award for 2021, and the Quicksilver 805 Pilothouse won the Best of Boats 2020 Award. 
The Boat Group is also advancing its sustainability initiatives, with our Fort Wayne Operations achieving Zero Waste to Landfill Status in 2020, with more than 90% of the plant's waste materials being recycled, reused, or otherwise sustainably eliminated. Forbes named Brunswick on its annual list of America's Best-In-State Employers 2020 in Minnesota, where the Boat Group's New York Mills Operation is located, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune named the New York Mills Operation a Top 150 Workplace in 2020 for the second consecutive year. In 2020, we also announced the formation of Ripl, a consumer advisory board dedicated to shaping the future of recreational boating through perspectives of boating and other marine consumers.
The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of more than 1,300 dealers and distributors, with some dealers operating in more than one location and some dealers carrying more than one of our boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's 
largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 27 percent of Boat Group sales in 2020. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is typically seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second quarter of the calendar year.
Business Acceleration
The Business Acceleration Group is dedicated to developing emerging and disruptive business models, focusing on services and subscriptions, engaging the next generation of boaters, and investing in early-stage innovative marine companies. Business Acceleration businesses accounted for 3 percent of Boat segment sales in 2020.
Business Acceleration businesses include Freedom Boat Club (FBC), which we believe is the world's leading boat club network. FBC is made up of more than 250 Company-owned and franchised boat club locations across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. These locations sell memberships comprised of an initiation fee and ongoing monthly payment in exchange for which members gain shared access to their local club’s diverse fleet of boats and reciprocal privileges at other FBC locations. We believe this boat club membership model provides access to the boating lifestyle in a way that attracts new entrants, keeps disaffected boaters in the fold, and helps grow the broader boating community. FBC also provides a channel for sales of our boats, marine engines, parts and accessories, and various other services we offer. In 2020, Entrepreneur Magazine named FBC among the 150 "Top Growth Franchises," an award for companies that have achieved the greatest positive franchisee unit growth in North America over a three-year period.
The Business Acceleration Group also includes Boating Services Network, a dealer finance and ancillary service business unit that provides floor plan finance through Brunswick Acceptance Company (USA) and Brunswick Commercial Finance (Canada), retail finance through Blue Water Finance and Mercury Repower Finance, retail extended warranties under the Passport and Passport Premier brands through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, retail insurance through Boater's Choice Insurance, and close to 50 name brand marine dealer service providers through Brunswick Dealer Advantage. Each offering allows us to deliver a more complete line of financial services and product offerings to our boat and marine engine dealers and their customers. See the "Financing Joint Venture" section below for details about our related financing joint venture that operates closely with the Boating Services Network.
Financing Joint Venture
Through our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement (JV Agreement), BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to our boat and engine dealers. A subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company owns the remaining 51 percent.
The JV Agreement contains a financial covenant that conforms to the maximum leverage ratio test in the Credit Facility described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The JV Agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the JV Agreement or the purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the JV Agreement at the end of its term.
Refer to Note 10 – Financing Joint Venture in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services offered through BAC.

Distribution
We utilize independent distributors, dealers, and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales and some sales of marine engines as well. We have over 16,000 active Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories: boats, engines, and parts and accessories.

We own Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Payne's Marine Group, BLA, and Lankhorst Taselaar, which comprise our primary P&A distribution platforms. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are leading distributors of marine parts and accessories, with a network of distribution warehouses located throughout the markets they service, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. 

Our Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitor and complementary products. We partner with our boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution, and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience.

Demand for a significant portion of our products is seasonal, and a number of our Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to stock product in advance of the peak selling season and provide stable channels for our products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, we may also provide our Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments, and financing receivable arrangements, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 8 – Financing Receivables and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.
Technology and Innovation
We believe Brunswick is uniquely positioned to define the future of the global marine industry. We are continuously and consistently innovating the future of recreational boating through growing service, connectivity, and alternative participation capabilities and businesses. To support our goal, we have established cross functional and cross business investments and initiatives, and hired new leaders with strong technology experience. We continue to develop solutions to further improve boater experiences both by advancing the efficiency and capabilities of our core product lines and through our ACES strategy. An example of this strategy is Mercury's Joystick Piloting System with advanced capabilities, including docking assistance. In addition, we continue to invest in electrification technology, personnel, and programs. The Fathom e-Power system, introduced in 2020 on the Sea Ray SLX-R 400e Outboard model, replaces a traditional gas-powered generator with a first-of-its-kind boat electrification feature. The Fathom system includes a high-capacity lithium-ion battery pack with an intuitive power management system to power the boat’s accessory systems for a longer, quieter, and more eco-friendly day on the water. We are driving the implementation of a full portfolio of 'digital first' initiatives that span our business units and product categories, and the consistent expansion of Freedom Boat Club demonstrates our commitment to shared access models. We also continue to partner with TechNexus Holdings, LLC to identify and incubate innovative start-up ventures with strategic marine applications to help drive long-term growth. 
International Operations
Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 6 – Segment Information and Note 2 – Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details our non-U.S. sales by region:

(in millions) | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Europe | $ | 550.1 | | | $ | 516.7 | | | $ | 494.3 
Canada | 246.3 | | | 279.9 | | | 287.3 | 
Asia-Pacific | 383.9 | | | 274.9 | | | 262.0 |

Total | $ | 1,349.5 | | | $ | 1,237.3 | | | $ | 1,202.9
Total International Sales as a Percentage of Net Sales | 31 | % | | 30 | % | | 29 | %

We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. 
Propulsion non-U.S. sales represented approximately 47 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2020. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following: 
•Distribution, sales, service, engineering, or representative offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland; 
•Light assembly facilities in Mexico;
•An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China; and
•An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan.
P&A non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 31 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2020. P&A's principal non-U.S. operations include manufacturing and distribution facilities in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico.
Boat non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 22 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2020. The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for us, which are sold mostly in international markets through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Of our boat sales in Canada and Europe, approximately 48 percent and 92 percent of the units, respectively, were produced in the region. 
Raw Materials and Supplies
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including commodities such as aluminum, resins, oil, and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise our production costs, which could reduce profitability if we did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved efficiencies.

Our global procurement operations continue to better leverage purchasing power across our divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts or derivatives to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices.

Intellectual Property
We have, and continue to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of our products and processes. By law, our patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. We believe that our patent rights are important to our competitive position in all of our business segments. Our trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Most of our intellectual property is owned by U.S. entities. 

In Propulsion, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives, and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch, and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers.

In P&A, patent rights principally relate to features of trolling motors as well as parts and accessories for marine and recreational vehicles.

Competitive Conditions and Position
We believe that we have a reputation for quality in each of our highly competitive lines of business. We compete in various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening our leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising, and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket products.

Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities.
 The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment:

Propulsion: We believe the Propulsion segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and related controls, rigging, and propellers. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance, manufacturing capabilities, depth of product portfolio, intuitive product controls, and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. 
P&A: We believe the P&A segment is a world leader in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing parts and accessories, including engine parts and consumables, electrical products, and boat parts and systems. The parts and accessories and distribution market is highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitive advantage in this market includes our product breadth, proprietary parts and technology, global distribution network, extensive portfolio of recognized brands, sales team, delivery timing, and service.

Boat: We believe the Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. However, few major manufacturers compete in the breadth of categories or geographies in which our Boat segment competes. Consequently, this business is highly competitive by category but also highly fragmented. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the bases of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution. In addition, we believe Freedom Boat Club is the largest operator of boat club locations in the world, with more than 250 locations, either Company-owned or franchised. This operating model providers boaters a unique and lower cost means to participate in boating. 
Human Capital Resources
Our business strategy relies on attracting, training, developing, and retaining a skilled workforce. We provide opportunities for continuous learning and development, such as Brunswick University, a program that offers courses in leadership and innovation, effective communication, and strategic thinking. In addition, we have instituted rotational leadership programs to attract, develop, and retain management and financial talent. We recognize that we operate in competitive marketplaces when it comes to finding top talent, particularly in technical fields. We strive to offer our employees career-specific tools and resources and support development opportunities through apprenticeships and robust training opportunities.
Employee safety is a top priority. We foster an environment with a strong emphasis on understanding, proactively identifying, and addressing potential safety risks in our business and operations. With respect to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have updated and implemented our pandemic plans and operations to ensure the continuation of safe and reliable service to customers and to maintain the safety of our employees, as well as to incorporate any new governmental guidance, rules, and regulations regarding workplace safety.
Our compensation philosophy is to encourage performance that creates sustainable, long-term shareholder value,
motivates achievement of financial and strategic goals, attracts, retains, and motivates talent, and reinforces our pay-for-performance culture. We continuously evolve our benefits programs, for example, by implementing paid parental leave and by instituting a long-standing, robust wellness program to encourage employees to build and maintain healthy lifestyles.
We are dedicated to enhancing diversity and inclusion in our workforce, because we believe both are key to the most
successful business outcomes. We strive to embrace a global, ethical, and respectful work culture. In 2020, we established an enterprise-wide Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team, designed to influence our actions and collectively drive progress to ensure DEI becomes more clearly visible and firmly embedded in our workplace culture. Also in 2020, we were proud that Forbes named Brunswick to its lists of Best Employers for Veterans and Women and America's Best-in-State Employers for both Wisconsin and Minnesota.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 14,382 people around the world. Less than 20% of our U.S. employees belong to labor unions, and we believe that the relationships between our employees, the unions, and the Company remain stable. The collective bargaining agreement between Mercury Marine and its largest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Lodge 1947, remains in place until August 26, 2023.
