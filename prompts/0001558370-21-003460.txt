Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the development of immune therapies and vaccines. Our gp96 platform is designed to activate the immune system. This platform has broad applications in cancer and infectious disease. Our platform leverages gp96’s role as a natural molecular warning system that presents antigens to the immune system. HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) is our first allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) cell line biologic product candidate in a series of proprietary immunotherapies designed to stimulate a patient’s T-cells to destroy cancer utilizing our gp96 platform. HS-130 is an allogeneic cell line engineered to express the extracellular domain of OX40 ligand fusion protein (OX40L-Fc), a key costimulator of T-cells, with the potential to augment antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell responses when combined with our gp96 platform. We have also initiated development of a new COVID-19 vaccine program under our Zolovax, Inc. subsidiary (“Zolovax”) that utilizes our gp96 platform to secrete SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We proposed a prototype vaccine directed against eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), a known biothreat to the United States and on the CDC list for needed vaccine therapeutics. Our subsidiary Pelican Therapeutics, Inc. (“Pelican”), is developing PTX-35, a novel T-cell co-stimulator agonist antibody targeting TNFRSF25 for systemic administration.
​
These programs are designed to harness the body's natural antigen specific immune activation and tolerance mechanisms to reprogram immunity and provide a long-term, durable clinical effect. We have completed recruiting patients in our Phase 2 HS-110 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trial and are enrolling patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial of HS-130 in combination with HS-110 and in our Phase 1 clinical trial of PTX-35. We are also providing pre-clinical, CMC development, and administrative support for these efforts; while constantly focusing on protecting and expanding our intellectual property in areas of strategic interest. As we advance our clinical programs, we are in close contact with our CROs and clinical sites and are assessing the impact of COVID-19 on our studies, current timelines and costs.
​
About our gp96 platform
Our gp96 platform, which includes ImPACT ® and ComPACT ™, is designed to activate and expand tumor antigen specific “killer” T-cells to destroy a patient’s cancer. By turning immunologically “COLD tumors HOT,” we believe our platform has the potential to become an essential component of the immuno-oncology regimen to enhance the effectiveness and durability of checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer therapies, thereby improving outcomes for those patients less likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors alone.
​
We believe this is a highly differentiated approach as our platform delivers a broad range of tumor antigens that are previously unrecognized by the patient’s immune system. Our gp96 platform combines these tumor antigens with a powerful, naturally occurring immune adjuvant, gp96, to actively chaperone these antigens. Our gp96 product candidates are non-replicating, “off-the-shelf”, allogenic cell-based therapies that are locally administered into the skin. The treatment primes local natural immune recognition to activate T-cells to seek and destroy the cancer cells throughout the body. These gp96 agents can be administered with a variety of immuno-modulators to enhance a patient’s immune response through T-cell activation.

Unlike many other “patient specific” or autologous immunotherapy approaches, our drugs are fully allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” products which means that we can administer them immediately without the extraction of blood or tumor tissue from each patient or the creation of an individualized treatment based on these patient materials. Our gp96 product candidates are produced from allogeneic cell lines expressing tumor-specific proteins common among cancers. Because each patient receives the same treatment, we believe that our immunotherapy approach offers superior speed to initiation, logistical, manufacturing and importantly, cost benefits, compared to “personalized” precision medicine approaches.
About ImPACT®
Our gp96 platform is an allogenic cell-based, T-cell-stimulating platform that functions as an immune activator to stimulate and expand T-cells. The key component of this innovative immunotherapy platform is the dual functionality of the heat shock protein, gp96.
​
As a molecular chaperone, gp96 is typically found within the cell’s endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates the folding of newly synthesized proteins for functionalized tasks. When a cell abnormally dies through necrosis or infection, gp96 is naturally released into the surrounding microenvironment. At this moment, gp96 becomes a Danger Associated Molecular Protein, or “DAMP”, a molecular warning signal for localized innate activation of the immune system. In this context, gp96 serves as a potent adjuvant, or immune stimulator, via Toll-Like Receptor 4/2 (TLR4 and TLR2) signaling which serves to activate professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells that upregulate T-cell costimulatory ligands, major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules and immune activating cytokines. It is among the most powerful adjuvants found in the body and uniquely shows exclusive specificity to CD8+ “killer” T-cells through cross-presentation of the gp96-chaperoned tumor associated peptide antigens directly to MHC class I molecules for direct activation and expansion of CD8+ T-cells. Thus, gp96 plays a critical role in the mechanism of action for our T-cell activating platform immuno-therapies; mimicking necrotic cell death and activating a powerful, tumor antigen-specific T-cell immune response to attack the patient’s cancer cells.
About ComPACT®
Our gp96 platform delivers antigen-driven T-cell activation and specific co-stimulation in a single product by providing
specific co-stimulation to enhance T-cell activation and expansion. This approach has the potential to simplify combination immunotherapy development for oncology patients, as it is designed to deliver the gp96 heat shock protein and a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (OX40L) as a single therapeutic, without the need for multiple, independent biologic products. This dual approach has several potential advantages including: (a) enhanced activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells; (b) boosting the number of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells compared to OX40L alone; (c) stimulation of T-cell memory function to remain effective after treatment, even if the cancer comes back; (d) demonstration of less toxicity, as the source of cancer associated antigens and co-stimulator are supplied at the same time locally in the draining lymph nodes, which drives targeted, cancer specific immunity towards the tumor rather than throughout the body; and (e) simplification of combination cancer immunotherapy versus systemic co-stimulation with conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).
​
About COVID-19 Program
Besides its utility in oncology, our gp96 platform has been shown to activate the human immune system to combat infectious diseases. Our collaborators have laid a solid foundation by engineering different pathogenic antigens into our platform. Previous preclinical studies using our gp96 platform includes SIV/HIV, malaria and Zika. We initiated a COVID-19 vaccine program in collaboration with the University of Miami in March 2020.
​
During the year we commenced preclinical testing of the vaccine under a sponsored research agreement and have continued development of a cell-based vaccine expressing gp96-Ig, OX40L-Ig and SARS-CoV-2 protein. In July 2020, we announced generation of proof-of-concept data demonstrating vaccine immunogenicity in relevant preclinical models, including expansion of human-HLA-restricted T-cells against immunodominant epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In August 2020, we reported preclinical data for our gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine generated at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, showing robust T cell mediated immune response directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Also in August 2020, we announced publication of positive preclinical COVID-19 vaccine results, which included

supporting data that our gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine induces systemic and tissue-specific (lung) memory CD8+ T cells and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells.
​
The strategy for this program includes providing prophylactic protection to elderly patients and those with underlying health conditions and driving a cellular immune response via CD8+ T cells, in addition to a humoral immune response. We have submitted grant applications to fund and accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development; however, there can be no assurance that our grant application will be approved and if approved, the amount of funding that we will receive.
​
About PTX-35
Pelican is focused on developing an agonist mAb, PTX-35, against a T-cell costimulatory receptor, TNFRSF25. PTX-35 is designed to harness the body's natural antigen specific immune activation and tolerance mechanisms to reprogram immunity and provide a long-term, durable clinical effect. TNFRSF25 agonism has been shown to provide highly selective and potent stimulation of antigen experienced ‘memory’ CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, which are the class of long-lived T-cells capable of eliminating tumor cells in patients. Due to the preferential specificity of PTX-35 to antigen experienced CD8+ T-cells, this agent represents a promising candidate as a T-cell co-stimulator in cancer patients.
​
When combined in preclinical studies with Heat’s gp96 platform immunotherapies and an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, PTX-35 has been shown to enhance antigen specific T-cell activation to eliminate tumor cells. Pelican is also developing other biologics that target TNFRSF25 modulators for various immunotherapy approaches.
​
​
Clinical Pipeline
HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) – Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Using our licensed ImPACT® platform technology, we developed the product candidate, HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) as a potential treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. HS-110 is our first lead biologic product candidate designed to stimulate a patient’s own T-cells to attack tumor cells. HS-110 is made of a lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line that has been genetically modified to secrete a wide range of cancer-associated antigens bound to gp96 proteins, thereby activating a broad, T-cell medicated immune response against a patient’s cancer.
We have completed enrollment in our Phase 2 trial of HS-110, in combination with either nivolumab (Opdivo®), a Bristol-Myers Squibb anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor or more recently, Merck’s anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), to treat patients with advanced NSCLC. The multicenter clinical trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of HS-110 in combination with nivolumab in a second line or greater setting, or with pembrolizumab in the front-line maintenance setting. 
On February 9, 2021, we announced positive interim data from the Phase 2 trial. Substantial survival benefit was observed in a cohort of previously treated, checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients with advanced NSCLC (Cohort A, N = 47). A median progression free survival (PFS) of 1.8 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 24.6 months was observed with a median follow-up time of 19.4 months. The one-year survival rate of Cohort A is 61.7%. The median OS data was 12.2 months and the 1-year survival rate was 50.7% in previously treated, advanced NSCLC patients who received nivolumab as a single agent, according to published data of the BMS CheckMate 057 study.
For NSCLC patients who had previously been treated with a checkpoint inhibitor and whose disease had subsequently progressed (Cohort B, N = 68), a median PFS of 2.8 months and median OS of 11.9 months was observed with a median follow-up time of 11.9 months. Published data from other studies reported median OS of 6.8 to 9.0 months for NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapies after PD-(L)1 progression.
As of this data cut, 30% of the patients in Cohort A and 26% of the patients in Cohort B were still alive. HS-110 has a favorable safety profile and has been administered in approximately 200 patients to date. As of this data cut, there have been no treatment-related serious adverse reactions. A review of immune-related adverse events reported in the study raised no safety concerns. The data to date demonstrate that combination of HS-110 and nivolumab is well-tolerated.

HS-130
We have initiated clinical development of HS-130 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. This product is designed to test our ComPACT™ technology approach. HS-130 intradermal delivers a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (OX40L). We have completed preclinical characterization and manufacturing activities for this product candidate.
Our first-in-human study is an open label dose-escalation study evaluating escalating doses of HS-130 in combination with HS-110 in up to 30 patients. The primary endpoints are to evaluate patient safety (treatment emergent adverse events, serious adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities) and to determine the optimal dose for a subsequent Phase 2 trial. We began enrolling patients in this study in 2019 and continue to enroll patients in this study.
Preclinical Pipeline
COVID-19 Vaccine
Our Zolovax subsidiary is focused on developing vaccines for infectious diseases based on our gp96 platform. Our collaborators have laid a good foundation on engineering different pathogenic antigens into our platform. Previous preclinical animal studies conducted includes simian immunodeficiency virus, malaria and Zika. We have initiated development of a COVID-19 vaccine program in collaboration with the University of Miami in March 2020. We utilize our proprietary gp96 platform to engineer multiple protein regions of the virus to activate the human immune system to combat COVID-19. Such design has the potential of generating long-term immune responses and may confer immunity to different coronaviruses. 
​
During the third quarter of 2020 we commenced preclinical testing of the vaccine under a sponsored research agreement. In July 2020, we announced generation of proof- of -concept data demonstrating vaccine immunogenicity in relevant preclinical models, including expansion of human-HLA-restricted T-cells against immunodominant epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In August 2020, we reported preclinical data for our gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine generated at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, showing robust T cell mediated immune response directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Also, in August 2020, we announced publication of positive preclinical COVID-19 vaccine results, that included data supporting that our gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine induces systemic and tissue-specific (lung) memory CD8+ T cells and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells.
​
On December 16, 2020 we announced completion of the gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine cell line ("ZVX-60"), which is being developed for use as either a standalone vaccine, or in combination with other vaccines to enhance prophylactic protection. Additional data collected since this announcement using ZVX-60 (gp96/OX40L-Ig, Spike vaccine), includes an in vivo dose-response test in mice showing that ZVX-60 induces HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T-cells at 0.5 million cells (1000 ng of gp96-Ig). ZVX-60 also upregulates CD69 and CXCR6 markers on CD8+ T-cells in the spleen, lung and BALF, with greatest increase in the BALF. ZVX-60 was able to increase the generation of effector and central memory cells over that of ZVX-55 (i.e., showing the contribution of OX40L addition), and was able to generate anti-Spike IgG and IgM antibodies, greater than ZVX-55.
​
On January 19, 2021, we announced that we have transferred our gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine cell line ("ZVX-60") to Waisman Biomanufacturing to initiate the manufacturing process for ZVX-60, which is being developed for use as either a standalone vaccine, or in combination with other vaccines, to enhance prophylactic protection against COVID-19.
​
PTX-35
Pelican Therapeutics is focused on the development of monoclonal antibody and fusion-protein based therapies designed to activate antigen experienced T-cell subsets of the immune system. Pelican’s lead product PTX-35 is a humanized, affinity matured, monoclonal antibody that serves as a functional agonist of human tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 25 (TNFRSF25), also known as death receptor 3 (DR3). This antibody stimulates antigen experienced ‘memory’ CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells with high specificity and potency. These cells are instrumental in destruction of tumor cells. Prior to our acquisition of 80% of Pelican in 2017, Pelican completed (1) humanization and affinity maturation of PTX-35; (2) PTX-35 epitope mapping or mapping of the binding site on the TNFRSF25 that is recognized by PTX-35; 

6



and (3) stability/development studies of PTX-35. Manufacturing and IND-enabling studies for PTX-35 were successfully completed in preparation for an IND filing for oncology.
Mouse surrogate of PTX-35 (i.e., human CDRs 1-3, but mouse Ig backbone), has shown activity in mouse models of corneal allograft, beta-islet transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, auto/inflammatory models of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), colitis and asthma. This mouse surrogate version of PTX-35 is a translation tool that allows predictability between in vivo model data and potential human activity.
In June 2020, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for PTX-35. In June 2020, we treated the first patient in our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating PTX-35. This first-in-human study is expected to enroll up to 30 patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard of care. The Phase 1 clinical trial of PTX-35 is an open-label, single arm, first in human intravenous administration of PTX-35 to patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, or who refuse available standard of care. Escalating dose levels of PTX-35 will be explored until optimal immunological dose or maximum tolerated dose is established. The primary objectives of the study include safety evaluation, determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose as well as exploratory analyses of clinical benefit and immunological effect of PTX-35. This trial is supported by a $15.2 million grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.
Preclinical studies with the murine precursor of PTX-35 have shown advantages over competing T-cell co-stimulator programs based on the expansion of tumor antigens specific CD8+ T-cells. In preclinical studies in colon, lung and breast cancer models, we have seen favorable results and favorable safety profiles in monkey and mouse studies.
Other TNFRSF25 Modulators
Next generation TNFRSF25 modulators (PTX-45 and others) that are differentiated from PTX-35 are in development. These novel TNFRSF25 immunomodulators may be designed for specific disease indications. 
Additional Indications
We continue to evaluate additional indications for the ImPACT® and ComPACT™ platform technologies, along with PTX-35 and next generation TNFRSF25 modulator compounds. Specifically, using ComPACT™, we have developed cell lines for several other cancers with the first product candidate being a second-generation therapy with similar cancer associated antigen overlap in multiple solid tumors (HS-130). Our decision to further pursue any product candidates, or any additional product candidates, will be based in part upon available funding and partnering opportunities.
The success of our ImPACT® and ComPACT™ platform therapies will depend on the clinical and regulatory success of our product candidates and our ability to retain, on commercially reasonable terms, financial and managerial resources, which are currently limited. To date, we have not received final regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derived any revenues from their sales. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will ever receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or derive any revenues from their sales.
Zolovax is in preclinical studies to develop therapeutic and preventative medicines to treat infectious diseases based on our gp96 therapeutic technology, with a current focus on the development of a vaccine to target the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

The Oncology Market and Current Treatments
The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 1.9 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2021. The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer is approximately 40.5% for men and 38.9% for women. It is projected that 608,570 Americans will die from cancer in 2021.
Lung cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 235,760 new cases of lung cancer in the United States diagnosed in 2021, accounting for about 12% of all cancer diagnosis. Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there remains a 

7



significant unmet medical need, as the overall five-year relative survival rate for lung cancer patients is 17% for men and 24% for women. Only 17% of lung cancers are diagnosed at a localized stage, for which the five-year survival is 59%. The American Cancer Society estimates that one in four deaths in the United States is due to cancer. Approximately 84% of all lung cancer is NSCLC.

ImPACT®/ComPACT™ Platform Technology Advantages
We seek to increase the percentage of patients with long-term benefit to checkpoint inhibitors with a combination treatment that is designed to activate and expand the T-cell’s immune defense mechanisms to seek out and kill cancer cells. ImPACT® and ComPACT™, variations of Heat’s gp96-based therapies, have been shown to stimulate an immune response based on a full antigenic repertoire of cancer cell associated proteins, not just one or a handful of antigens. The technologies are designed to combine a broad antigen repertoire of known tumor associated antigens, complexed with a potent immune adjuvant (gp96). The activated immune response generated by our gp96-based therapies may be useful in treating a wide range of cancers and infectious diseases. The advantages include:

● | gp96 therapies are administered with checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-modulators with the goal of enhancing immune response through T-cell activation. Genetically engineered allogenic cells are injected into the dermal layers of the skin of patients to elicit an immune response against the patient’s own tumor. The treatment primes immune recognition and triggers the body to stimulate a robust adaptive, T-cell mediated immune system to seek and destroy the cancer cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | gp96 therapies are allogeneic, off-the-shelf treatments designed to activate the immune system to turn immunologically "cold" tumors "hot." With ImPACT®, therapies can be administered alongside checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-modulators to increase effectiveness. Our ComPACT™ therapy combines antigen delivery and cross presentation with a highly selective T-cell co-stimulator within a single treatment, simplifying combination immunotherapy, while providing superior immune activation/expansion with reduced treatment costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our “off-the-shelf,” cancer-fighting therapies are designed to expand cancer reactive immune cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. They jump-start immune recognition of common, cancer associated neo-antigens (proteins expressed normally in development prior to the upregulation of MHC expression) that are re-expressed in the cancer upon malignant transformation. When used alongside checkpoint inhibitors, they have been shown to boost T-cell activity to more effectively target and destroy cancer cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We don’t require invasive procedures or the isolation of patient tissues. We are not extracting anything from anyone. This eliminates the inconvenience and costs associated with securing, expanding, storing and transporting patient samples, while eliminating potential surgical risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our therapies do not require an additional adjuvant, or immune stimulant. Other immunotherapies may require the addition of an adjuvant to enhance effectiveness and reduce toxicity. Our product candidate incorporates gp96, itself a powerful biological adjuvant, ensuring that no additional immune adjuvants are necessary to generate an activated, T-cell mediated immune response.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Custom manufacturing is not necessary. Our products are mass-produced and readily available for immediate patient use. Each patient receives the same treatment, offering logistical, manufacturing and other cost benefits, compared to patient-specific or “personalized” medicine approaches.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PTX-35 and Next Generation TNFRSF25 Modulator Advantages
The advantages include:

● | Pelican provides access to a T-cell co-stimulator and novel TNFRSF25 modulators in development that further broadens our pipeline and strengthens our portfolio within the emerging T-cell co-stimulation space. We believe the use of these therapeutic agents, in combination with other immunotherapies, have the potential to be synergistic with our TCAP to dramatically improve patient outcomes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pelican is the only company with a disclosed preclinical pipeline targeting the T-cell co-stimulator, TNFRSF25. We believe PTX-35 can activate antigen-specific memory CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells that has the potential to eliminate patient’s tumor cells. This approach is designed to harness the body’s natural antigen specific immune activation and tolerance mechanisms to reprogram and expand antigen experienced immunity, to support a long-term, durable therapeutic effect. When combined with immunotherapies, including the ImPACT® and ComPACT™ platform technologies, PTX-35 enhances antigen specific T-cell activation to eliminate tumor cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preclinical studies with the murine precursor to PTX-35 show advantages over competing T-cell co-stimulator programs based on CD8+ T-cell specificity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Next generation TNFRSF25 modulators may improve on PTX-35 and have unique properties such as improved affinity or avidity or a shorter half-life.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COVID-19 Vaccine Advantages
This is a potential first-in-class COVID-19 vaccine designed to generate long-term immune responses and may confer immunity to different coronaviruses. Our COVID-19 vaccine program is incorporating multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens using our gp96 platform. We are mimicking the natural immune process to induce long-term immunity and to confer protection for individuals against future infections. In contrast to other vaccine approaches, our platform offers the following advantages:

● | No anti-vector immunity given that we are not using a virus-based vector-system
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No viral activation as we do not utilize any attenuated virus
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Both T cells and B cells are activated with high immunogenicity to drive induction of mucosal immunity and long-term memory response
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategy
Our objective is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development and commercialization of allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” immunotherapies. ImPACT® and ComPACT™ are designed to address synergistic mechanisms of action: natural delivery of a robust repertoire of cancer associated antigens (CTAs) coupled with the activation, co-stimulation and expansion of cancer-specific killer T-cells to further enhance patients’ immune activity and immune memory. Pelican’s lead compound, PTX-35, is a humanized affinity matured TNFRSF25 agonist antibody, and potential best-in-class T-cell co-stimulator due to its preferential antigen specific memory CD8+ T-cells that are considered most potent in eliminating cancer cells. Preclinical studies with systemically administered PTX-35 show advantages over competing T-cell co-stimulator programs. In addition, Pelican is the only company with a disclosed program targeting TNFRSF25 for use in immuno-oncology, with a broad, pioneering intellectual property estate. Our gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine program is being developed for use as either a standalone vaccine, or in combination with other vaccines, to enhance prophylactic protection against COVID-19.

We believe future cancer immunotherapies will involve multiple agents and our platforms could work synergistically with therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to reverse tumor-induced immune exhaustion and suppression. We are focused on discovering, developing, and applying the ImPACT® and ComPACT™ platform technologies, and our PTX-35 compound in combination with other immunotherapies towards a number of disease indications. The key elements of our strategy are:

● | Develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We have completed enrollment of the HS 110 trial in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab to treat patients with advanced NSCLC. We have initiated enrollment in our Phase 1 trial of HS-130 in combination with H-110 for treatment of solid tumors and our Phase 1 trial of PTX-35 for the treatment of solid tumors. Beyond these trials – depending upon funding and partnering opportunities – we plan to initiate new clinical trials of combined immunotherapy agents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize commercial opportunity for the ImPACT® and ComPACT™ technology, as well as our PTX 35 and next generation TNFRSF25 modulator compounds. Our current product candidates target large markets with significant unmet medical needs. For each of our product candidates, we seek to maximize the economic potential of any future U.S. or international commercialization efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance our partnering efforts. We are continually exploring partnerships for licensing and other collaborative relationships and remain opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships that maximize our economic potential.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further expand our broad patent portfolio. We have made a significant investment in the development of our patent portfolio to protect our technologies and programs, and we intend to continue to do so. We have obtained exclusive rights to six different patent families directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to our platform and preclinical development programs for cancer, and have filed additional patent applications that are owned by us. The ImPACT®/ComPACT™ patent portfolio comprise more than 30 granted patents and 40 pending patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe, and Japan, as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets. In total, Pelican holds approximately 50 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 20 U.S. and foreign patents are pending.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manage our business with efficiency and discipline. We believe we have efficiently utilized our capital and human resources to develop and acquire our product candidates and programs and create a broad intellectual property portfolio. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced management team with backgrounds in developing and commercializing product candidates. We use project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic program decisions and to attempt to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtain additional non-dilutive grant funding in addition to Pelican’s $15.2 million CPRIT Grant. To develop our technologies and compounds more fully, and their application to a variety of human diseases, we plan to continue to seek and access external sources of grant funding on our own behalf and in conjunction with our academic and other partners, including retention of lobbyists, to support the development of our pipeline programs. While we intend to work with our academic partners to secure additional grant funding, these partners have no obligation to work with us to secure such funding. We also intend to continue to evaluate opportunities and, as appropriate, acquire or license technologies that meet our business objectives.

On April 28, 2017, we consummated the acquisition of 80% of the outstanding equity of Pelican, a related party, and Pelican became our majority owned subsidiary as contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) that we entered into with Pelican, and certain stockholders of Pelican holding a majority of the outstanding shares.

10



Pelican is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibody and fusion protein-based therapies that are designed to activate the immune system. In exchange for 80% of the outstanding capital stock of Pelican on a fully diluted basis, we paid to the Pelican Stockholders that executed the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Participating Pelican Stockholders”) an aggregate of $0.5 million minus certain liabilities (the “Cash Consideration”), and issued to the Participating Pelican Stockholders 19,015 shares of our restricted common stock representing 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the date of the initial execution of the Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Consideration”). The Pelican Stockholders that sold their shares in Pelican to us (the “Participating Pelican Stockholders”) included Jeffrey Wolf, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, John Monahan and Edward Smith, two of our directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Committee at the time of the closing and/or entities controlled by them. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Cash Consideration of approximately $0.3 million was distributed to the Participating Pelican Stockholders and the remainder of approximately $0.2 million for certain Pelican liabilities not satisfied was retained by us and recognized as other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we distributed to the Participating Pelican Stockholders $2.0 million upon dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 trial of PTX-35, of which approximately of 22% was distributed to our executive officers and directors who are Participating Pelican Stockholders.
Under the Purchase Agreement, we are also obligated to make future payments based on the achievement of certain clinical and commercialization milestones, as well as low single digit royalty payments and payments upon receipt of sublicensing income:

(1) | $1.5 million upon Pelican’s dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 2 trial for an oncology indication;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | $3.0 million upon successful outcome of the first Phase 2 trial for an oncology indication;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | $6.0 million upon Pelican’s dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 3 trial for an oncology indication;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | $3.0 million upon Pelican’s dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 3 trial for a non-oncology indication;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | $7.5 million upon successful outcome of the first Phase 3 trial for an oncology indication;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | $3.0 million upon successful outcome of the first Phase 3 trial for a non-oncology indication;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(7) | $7.5 million upon acceptance of a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for an oncology indication;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(8) | $3.0 million upon acceptance of a BLA submission for a non-oncology indication;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(9) | $7.5 million upon first product indication approval in the United States or Europe for an oncology indication; and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(10) | $3.0 million upon first product indication approval in the United States or Europe for a non- oncology indication.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pelican has been awarded $15.2 million to fund preclinical and some clinical activities from Cancer Prevention Institute of Texas (CPRIT) grant (the “CPRIT Grant”). The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement where Pelican will match $0.50 for every $1.00 from CPRIT, which totals $7.6 million over the life of the project. 
In connection with the Pelican Acquisition, the Participating Pelican Stockholders entered into a Stockholders’ Agreement (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”) with us with respect to the Pelican common stock retained by the Participating Pelican Stockholders (the “Retained Shares”). The Stockholders’ Agreement, contains restrictions on transfer of the Retained Shares and drag-along rights in the event of a consolidation or merger of Pelican with another entity after the date of the Purchase Agreement or the sale of all or substantially all of Pelican’s assets or a transaction in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting rights attached to the Pelican securities are sold. In addition, Participating Pelican Stockholders will have co-sale rights in connection with our transfer of the Pelican common stock that we own.
In October 2018, we entered into an agreement with the University of Miami (“UM”) whereby UM exchanged its shares of Pelican stock, of which it owned 5% equity on a fully diluted basis for a certain number of shares along with UM shares in Heat Biologics I, Inc., of which it owned 7.5% equity (together herein the “Subsidiary Shares”) for 5,000 shares of Heat Biologics, Inc. common stock, $0.0002 par value; resulting in Heat owning 85% of Pelican and 100% of its subsidiary Heat Biologics I.
CPRIT Grant
In May 2016, Pelican was awarded a $15.2 million CPRIT Grant from CPRIT for development of Pelican’s lead product candidate, PTX-35. The CPRIT Grant is expected to allow Pelican to develop PTX-35 through a 40-50 patient Phase 1 

11



clinical program. The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement where Pelican will match $0.50 for every $1.00 from CPRIT. Consequently, Pelican is required to raise $7.6 million in matching funds over the life of the project.
As of December 31, 2020, CPRIT has provided $13.7 million of the total $15.2 million grant. The remaining $1.5 million will be awarded, on a reimbursement basis, after we have fulfilled every requirement of the grant and the grant has been approved to be finalized, rather than in advance of expending the funds as in the prior grant years. As of December 31, 2020, we have provided approximately $6.6 million which was used to satisfy Pelican’s matching fund obligation under the first four years of the CPRIT Grant. Approximately $1.0 million is remaining to provide in the fifth year of the CPRIT grant.
The CPRIT Grant, as is customary for all CPRIT awards, contains a requirement that Pelican pay CPRIT a royalty on sales of commercial products developed using CPRIT funds equal to between three and five percent of revenue until such time as CPRIT has been paid an aggregate amount equal to 400% of the grant award proceeds. After 400% of the grant award proceeds has been paid, Pelican will pay CPRIT a royalty of 0.5% in perpetuity. After the CPRIT Grant terminates, Pelican is not permitted to retain any unused grant award proceeds without CPRIT’s approval, but Pelican’s royalty and other obligations, including its obligation to repay the disbursed grant proceeds under certain circumstances, to maintain certain records and documentation, to notify CPRIT of certain unexpected adverse events and Pelican’s obligation to use reasonable efforts to ensure that any new or expanded preclinical testing, clinical trials, commercialization or manufacturing related to any aspect of our CPRIT project take place in Texas, survive the termination of the agreement. In addition, if Pelican relocates its principal place of business outside of Texas within the three year period after the date of final payment of grant funds (which final payment has not yet occurred), we are required to repay to CPRIT all grant funds received. Pelican expects to have received and expended all of the grant award proceeds by the agreement termination date.
The CPRIT Grant is subject to Pelican complying with all terms set forth in the CPRIT Grant, including Pelican maintaining its status with CPRIT as a Texas-based entity. In order to qualify as a Texas-based entity, a company must fulfill a majority of the following seven requirements: (i) its US headquarters must be physically located in Texas; (ii) its chief executive officer must reside in Texas; (iii) a majority of its personnel, including at least two other senior-level employees, must reside in Texas; (iv) its manufacturing activities must take place in Texas; (v) at least 90% of its grant award funds must be paid to individuals and entities in Texas, including salaries and personnel costs for employees and contractors: (vi) at least one clinical trial site must be in Texas; and (vii) it must collaborate with a medical research organization in Texas, including a public or private institution of higher education. Currently, Pelican meets a majority of these seven requirements.
Intellectual Property
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies; preserve our trade secrets and exclusive rights in our unique biological materials; and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the strongest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates and our subsidiaries’, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business – We have limited protection for our intellectual property, which could impact our competitive position.”
We will continue to depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

Our and our subsidiaries’ programs are supported by growing patent estates that are comprised of intellectual property owned by us and our subsidiaries’, or exclusively licensed from UM. ImPACT®, ComPACT™, PTX-35, next generation TNFRSF25 modulators, and ZVX-060 are protected by issued patents and various pending patent applications. In total, Heat holds approximately 30 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 40 U.S. and foreign patents pending. In total, Pelican holds approximately 50 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 20 U.S. and foreign patents are pending.
Heat’s ImPACT® coverage is found in: the “Allogeneic Cancer –Based Immunotherapy” patent family patented in the US (US Patent Nos. 8,475,785 and 9,238,064), Europe, Israel, Australia and Canada and the “Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same” patent family, which is granted in the US (US Patent No. 8,968,720). Both of these patent families are subject to exclusive license agreements with UM and provide protection to 2029 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions). Various recently filed provisional and international (PCT) patent applications assigned to Heat and relating to ImPACT® are also pending.
Heat’s ComPACT™ technology is covered by US Patent Nos. 10,046,047 and 10,780,161 and a series of patents pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions (i.e. Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, India, Korea, Russia, Singapore and South Africa) and assigned to Heat. Various recently filed provisional, international (PCT), US, and foreign patent applications assigned to Heat and related to ComPACT™ are also pending and may provide coverage to 2038 to 2042, if granted (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions).
Pelican’s PTX-35 and next generation TNFRSF25 modulators coverage stems from three exclusive license agreements with UM (i.e. “UM03-31 UM05-39” of July 11, 2008; “UMI176” of December 12, 2010, as amended December 7, 2020; and “UM-143 UMN-106” of November 19, 2013). Patents are granted or pending in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions (such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Korea, Israel, Singapore, and Hong Kong). US Patent No. 9,603,925, with term to 2034 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers novel TNFRSF25 modulator compositions in combination with additional therapies. US Patent No. 9,499,627, with term to 2030 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers novel TNFRSF25 modulator uses in therapies to delay transplant rejections. US Patent No. 9,839,670, with term to 2026 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers PTX-35 compositions in combination with a tumor antigen. US Patent No. 9,017,679 with term to 2026 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers methods of using PTX-35, among other things. Recent patent applications assigned to Pelican are intended to provide further compositional coverage for PTX-35. US Patent Nos. 9,982,057 and 10,005,843 provide composition of matter coverage for PTX-35 and have term to 2035 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions).
Heat’s COVID-19 (2019-nCoV virus) efforts are supported by four patent families. The Company co-owns one family which currently consists of an international (PCT) and a US patent application, with University of Miami, on a vaccine approach. The Company is the exclusive licensee of University of Miami’s rights in these patent applications.
License Agreements
The “Modified Heat Shock Proteins-Antigenic Peptide Complex” patent family is licensed pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement that was entered into by Heat in July 2008 and subsequently assigned to our subsidiary Heat Biologics I, Inc. which issued to UM shares of its common stock representing seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of its common stock, of which UM transferred to Heat in exchange for shares of our common stock in October 2018. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent, unless terminated earlier. The license agreement grants Heat Biologics I, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the patent-related rights. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, Heat Biologics I, Inc. was obligated to pay the University an upfront license fee of $150,000, additional yearly payments initially of $10,000 that increased to $20,000 in 2013 and a milestone payment of $500,000 upon approval of a BLA for the lung cancer vaccine covered by the patents rights being licensed.
The “Allogeneic Cancer-Based Immunotherapy” patent family is licensed to Heat Biologics I, Inc. pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement that was entered into with UM in February 2011 and the “Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same” patent family is licensed to Heat Biologics 1, Inc. pursuant to the terms of an 

13



exclusive license agreement that was also entered into with UM in February 2011. No upfront, annual or milestone payments are required to be paid to the University under either of these license agreements. The license agreements grant Heat Biologics I, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the patent-related rights.
As consideration for the rights granted in each of these three license agreements, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights in the respective license agreements. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to UM equal to a percentage of sublicense income. Each of these additional license agreements also provides that the licensee will not have to pay more than the above-noted royalty rates and sublicense fees if more than one license from UM is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights.
All of the above-described license agreements, as amended, provide that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee: (1) has not introduced, or at least used its best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the United States, European Union, or Japan by December 31, 2025; (2) has not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (3) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it. Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation under any one of the above license agreements by a party, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement upon 90 days’ notice or 30 days’ notice if the breach relates to payments due to UM. In the event of a termination, Heat Biologics I, Inc. will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. Each of the above license agreements also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensee’s agreement to indemnify UM for liabilities arising out of the negligence of the licensee, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements.
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Shattuck Labs, Inc. (“Shattuck”) pursuant to which we licensed to Shattuck certain provisional patent applications and know-how related to fusion proteins to treat cancer and other diseases that were not being developed by us. Shattuck paid us an initial license fee of $50,000 and is obligated to pay us fees upon its receipt of sublicensing income, achievement of certain milestones and royalties upon sales of commercial products. Inasmuch as the technology that we out-licensed is in the early stages of development and there is a low likelihood of success for any technology at such stage, there can be no assurance that any products will be developed by Shattuck or that we will derive any revenue from Shattuck.
Zolovax Licenses
In October 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc., entered into an agreement with UM for the license and development of a portfolio of patents leveraging its gp96 platform to target the Zika virus and other infectious diseases. The preclinical studies using the licensed technology have been initiated and are progressing. The term of the license is the length of the last to expire patent, unless terminated earlier. The license agreement grants Zolovax, Inc. exclusive, worldwide rights to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the patent-related rights. As consideration for the rights granted in this license agreement, the licensee paid an upfront fee, is obligated to pay annual payments commencing on the third anniversary of the license agreement and royalties equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights in the respective license agreements. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Zolovax, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to UM equal to a percentage of sublicense income. The license agreement provides for diligence milestones payments of up to an aggregate of $1,450,000 that include pre-IND meeting with the FDA, IND submission to the FDA and dosing first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The license agreement also provides that the licensee will not have to pay more than the above-noted royalty rates if more than one license from UM is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. The license agreement provides that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee has engaged in certain bankruptcy events or has breached the terms of the license agreement which includes having (i) failed to make a required payment; (ii) failed to 

14



achieve a milestone or not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; (iii) failed to possess insurance coverage, or (iv) filed a false report. Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation that remains uncured for 30 days’ after notice thereof, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement. In March 2020, we entered into a research agreement with UM pursuant to which we sponsor the research and development of COVID-19 vaccine using our gp96 platform and a research agreement with UM for the development of a COVID-19 point-of-care diagnostic test. In May 2020, we suspended the point-of-care diagnostic program due to the progress made by other diagnostic manufacturers utilizing a similar approach, and our desire to focus resources on the COVID-19 vaccine program. In the process, we developed our own unique diagnostic intellectual property, and plan to opportunistically explore partnership opportunities around this technology.
​
On December 31, 2020, Zolovax entered into an exclusive license agreement with UM for the license and development of a portfolio of patents leveraging its UMIP-510 platform to target the COVID-19 virus and other infectious diseases. The license agreement grants Zolovax exclusive, worldwide rights to research, develop, make, use or sell Licensed Products (as defined in the license agreement) based upon patent-related rights. The term of the license is the later of the length of the last to expire patent or fifteen (15) years from the date of the first sale of a Licensed Product unless terminated earlier. As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, Zolovax paid an upfront fee of $2,500, is obligated to pay certain annual payments and to pay royalties equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of Licensed Products. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize the Licensed Products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Zolovax is obligated to pay royalties to UM equal to a percentage of sublicense income. The license agreement provides for diligence milestones that include IND submission to the FDA or EMA within twenty-four months of the effective date of the license agreement, dosing first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial within nine months of approval of an IND, and making commercially reasonable efforts towards obtaining regulatory marketing approval for a Licensed Product form either the FDA or EMA. The license agreement also provides for commercial milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $7,750,000 upon the achievement of $10,000,000, $100,000,000 and $500,000,000 of cumulative net sales of License Products. The License Agreement provides that Zolovax may terminate the license agreement upon ninety days’ notice to UM, UM has the right to terminate the license agreement if Zolovax has engaged in certain bankruptcy events and each party has the right to terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the terms of the license agreement, and such breach remains uncured for thirty days.
​
Pelican License Agreements
Under license agreements with UM, Pelican has obtained exclusive rights to six different patent families each directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to targeting TNFRSF25/TL1A for the purpose of modulating immune responses. These families comprise approximately 45 granted U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 30 U.S. and foreign patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe and Japan as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets. As partial consideration for the initial two license agreements with UM, Pelican issued UM 300,000 shares of its common stock of which UM transferred to Heat in exchange for shares of our common stock in October 2018.
As consideration for the rights granted under the initial license agreement, UM-143 and UMN-106 non-oncology, Pelican is obligated to pay UM certain upfront license fees and milestone payments of ((i) $25,000 upon submission of an IND, (ii) $25,000 upon approval of an IND, (iii) $100,000 upon completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial and (iv) $250,000 the earlier of May 2022 or approval of a NDA), an annual minimum royalty payment $20,000 and royalties (mid-range single digits) based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. 
As consideration for the rights granted under the second license agreement, UMI-176, Pelican is obligated to pay UM certain upfront license fees, and aggregate milestone payments of (i) $25,000 upon submission of an NDA, (ii) $25,000 upon approval of a NDA; (iii) $100,000 upon completion of Phase 1 clinical trial and (iv) $500,000 the earlier of May 2022 or approval of an NDA), an annual minimum royalty payment $20,000 and royalties (mid-range single digits) based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. 
As consideration for the rights granted in the third license agreement, UM03-31 and UM05-39, Pelican is obligated to pay UM certain upfront license fees, past and future patent costs, an annual minimum royalty payment $20,000 and royalties 

15



(mid-range single digits) based on net sales on commercialized products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. The third license agreement with UM provides that in the event that Pelican terminates its second license agreement with UM, Pelican is obligated to pay UM an annual minimum royalty payment of $20,000 for each year after 2014 during the term of the third license agreement as well as the following milestone payments: (i) $25,000 upon submission of an IND; (ii) $25,000 upon approval of a NDA; (iii) $100,000 upon completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial; and (iv) $250,000 the earlier of May 31, 2022 or approval of a NDA. The royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Pelican is obligated to pay royalties to UM equal to a percentage of sublicense income. The third license agreement also provides that Pelican will not have to pay more than above royalty rates and sublicense fees if more than one license from UM is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights. 
All of the above-described Pelican license agreements provide that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee (1) has not introduced, or at least used its best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the United States, European Union, or Japan by December 31, 2022 (December 2025 for the UMI-176 license agreement); (2) has not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (3) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it. Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation under any one of the above license agreements by a party, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement upon 90 days’ notice or 30 days’ notice if the breach relates to payments due to UM. In the event of a termination, Pelican will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. Each of the above license agreements also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensee’s agreement to indemnify UM for liabilities arising out of the negligence of the licensee, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements.
Manufacturing
We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce and store our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities.
We utilized an external vendor for manufacturing of HS-110 used in our Phase 2 clinical trial. We have an agreement with GenCure Biomanufacturing for optimization of the HS-110 manufacturing process and for the manufacture of GMP material to support initiation of a Phase 3 program. 
The HS-110 product used in the inventor’s Phase 1, and in our Phase 2 clinical trial was manufactured under cGMP (current good manufacturing practices). The gp96 cell line is grown in large quantities, dispensed into individual doses, frozen in liquid nitrogen, irradiated to render cell replication incompetent and quality tested in compliance with FDA guidelines. The product is irradiated, which is a commonly used attenuation process that eliminates the ability of the gp96-Ig-containing cell lines to replicate but allows them to remain metabolically active and secrete gp96-Ig. The batches of frozen, irradiated drug product are stable for long periods of time and are thawed immediately prior to administration to patients
Heat has also begun development of an additional product, HS-130, for treatment of select solid tumors. This product will utilize our ComPACT™ technology concept, which is designed to deliver the gp96 heat shock (HS-110) protein and a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (OX40L) in HS-130. We have completed the cGMP manufacturing and nonclinical IND enabling activities to support the clinical development of this product. This product is currently being used in a Phase 1 clinical trial.
Heat has also begun manufacturing of its gp96-based COVID-19 vaccine cell line ("ZVX-60"), using Waisman Biomanufacturing, which is being developed for use as either a standalone vaccine, or in combination with other vaccines, to enhance prophylactic protection against COVID-19.

Pelican is focused on the development of monoclonal antibody and fusion-protein based therapies designed to activate specific T-cell subsets of the immune system. We have utilized an external vendor for development of PTX-35, a humanized affinity matured monoclonal antibody that is a functional agonist of human TNFRSF25. This antibody provides highly selective and potent stimulation of ‘memory’ CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. This is a subset of the class of T-cell that is responsible for eliminating tumor cells in patients. 
We have performed assay development work at our Texas laboratory to support our clinical needs as well as those of third parties. In an effort to decrease our dependence upon third party manufacturers and enhance efficiency, we are exploring the establishment of process development and manufacturing capability to support our clinical trials and potentially third party manufacturing needs.
Competition
The pharmaceutical, biologics and the diagnostic industry is highly competitive and characterized by a number of established large companies, and mid-sized companies, as well as smaller companies like ours. If our competitors’ market products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than any future products developed from our product candidates, or that reach the market before our approved product candidates, we may not achieve commercial success. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. As a biotechnology company with cancer immunotherapy agents as lead product candidates, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, cancer immunotherapy can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., MerckKGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Bausch Health Companies, NewLink Genetics Corporation, Agenus Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., IMV Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., and others, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches.
We expect to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our competitors may:

We expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.
The primary treatments for non-small cell lung cancer are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies and various combinations of each of these treatments. A large number of patients, particularly with advanced disease, are refractory to these treatments and are subsequently treated with a number of emerging biologic agents, including immunotherapy. Some examples of therapies commonly attempted with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients include: Opdivo® (nivolumab), Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), Alimta® (pemetrexed), Avastin® (bevacizumab), Tarceva® (erlotinib), Gemzar® (gemcitabine), Paraplatin® (carboplatin), Taxol® (paclitaxel), Taxotere® (docetaxel), and Navelbine® (vinorelbine). It is unlikely that biologic agents will compete with more traditional therapies in the short-term, but many oncologists believe that such therapies will eventually become the mainstay of lung cancer therapy. None of these agents have proven particularly effective for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients, with the most effective therapies only increasing survival by a few months. As a result, we do not consider these agents to be direct competitors to HS-110 because they are likely to be given either in sequence or in conjunction with some of the agents listed. Furthermore, many patients cannot tolerate many of the chemotherapeutics listed. Thus, we believe if HS-110 has a positive safety profile (without observation of local or systemic toxicities, none of which have been seen to date), it is possible that HS-110 would be preferred both by physicians and patients in this stage of disease.
Our strategy is to emphasize what we believe to be our competitive advantages, which our products in development are expected to have less side effects than most other cancer therapies, be available at lower prices than other therapies, and ultimately could work on many types of cancer and not just one specific type.
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.

18



Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (1) in compliance with federal regulations; (2) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2.9 million, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to an annual program fee which is currently set at more than $336,000. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA undertakes to perform an initial filing review within 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs or 

19



biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee – typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts – for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or nine months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ’off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the 

20



obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Cell and Tissue-Based Biologics
Establishments that manufacture cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell- and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also include requirements for a unified registration and listing system, donor screening and testing, adverse reaction reporting, and labeling.
Cell and tissue-based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non-homologous use. Products manufactured using the ImPACT® technology meet this threshold and therefore are considered biological drugs. Manufacture of ImPACT® products are subject to both cGTP and cGMP regulations for manufacturing quality. Marketing of these products in the United States will require FDA approval under the BLA pathway as discussed above.

21



Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Additionally, the intent standard under the anti-kickback statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act., as discussed below.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services; making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim; or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted 

22



under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouse, that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, some of which are more stringent and many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, 

23



reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost- effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. It is unclear how these challenges and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact our business in the future.

24



Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Non-U.S. Regulation
Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level; however, the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union member states. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.
While we intend to market our products outside the United States in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with non-U.S. authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing.
Research and Development
We have built an internal and external research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory and quality assurance. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Our cancer trials have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development. Research and development expenses were $12.9 million during both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Emerging Growth Company
As of January 1, 2019, we were no longer an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted in April 2012 (“JOBS ACT”).
As an emerging growth company, we were subject to reduced public company reporting requirements and were exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports 

25



concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
As an emerging growth company, we were also exempt from Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, which require stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of executive compensation and golden parachutes.

On May 30, 2012, we formed two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Heat Biologics III, Inc. and Heat Biologics IV, Inc. We formed Heat Biologics GmbH (Heat GmbH), a wholly-owned limited liability company, organized in Germany on September 11, 2012 and Heat Biologics Australia Pty LTD, a wholly-owned company, registered in Australia on March 14, 2014. On October 25, 2016, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc., to focus on the development of gp96 based vaccines targeting Zika, HIV, West Nile, dengue, yellow fever, and SARS-CoV-2. In June 2012, we divested our 92.5% interest in Pelican (formerly known as Heat Biologics II, Inc.). On April 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of an 80% controlling interest in Pelican, a related party prior to acquisition. In October 2018, we entered into an agreement with UM whereby UM exchanged its shares of stock in Heat’s subsidiaries, Heat I, Inc. and Pelican, resulting in us owning 100% of Heat I, Inc. and increasing its controlling ownership in Pelican from 80% to 85%. We assigned our proprietary rights related to the development and application of our ImPACT® therapy platform to Heat Biologics I, Inc. In November 2018, we formed Skunkworx Bio, Inc. (formerly known as Delphi Therapeutics, Inc.) which uses a unique and proprietary platform to generate new biological entities that we may rapidly advance into clinical development. Also, in November 2018, we formed Scorpion Biological Services, Inc. (“Scorpion”) (formerly known as Scorpion Biosciences, Inc.), to focus on developing bioanalytic, process development and manufacturing capability to service our in-house requirements as well as potentially those of others. In February 2021, we formed Abacus Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary to pursue additional opportunities related to our business.
We are also a “smaller reporting company”, as defined in Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will cease to be a smaller reporting company if we have (i) more than $250 million in market value of our shares held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) more than $100 million of annual revenues in our most recent fiscal year completed before the last business day of our second fiscal quarter and a market value of our shares held by non-affiliates more than $700 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.

Human Capital
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, retain and motivate key personnel. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in drug discovery, research and development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory affairs and believe Heat Biologics directly benefits from this experience and industry knowledge. Our research team comprises B.S., M.S. and Ph.D.-level scientists with expertise in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 39 full-time employees, of which 10 are part of our research team located in San Antonio, Texas, 21 are part of our research team located in Morrisville, North Carolina and eight are part of our corporate team. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.
We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Although, management continually seeks to add additional talent to its work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. 
Competitive Pay and Benefits. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

● | we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a 401K retirement plan with employer matching contributions (maximum of 4% match) and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, and paid parental leave.

Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include:

● | adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------
