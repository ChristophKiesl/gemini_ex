ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Imaging3, Inc. has developed a proprietary medical technology designed to produce 3D medical diagnostic images in real time. In the future, healthcare workers using Imaging3 devices will potentially be able to instantly view 3D, high-resolution images of virtually any part of the human body. The company has also entered into a Dealership Agreement with Envisiontec to promote and distribute 3-D Printers. The company feels these units can and will eventually tie into their current 3-D technology.
Business Operations
 
Imaging3 technology has the potential to contribute to the improvement of healthcare. Our technology is designed to cause 3D images to be instantly constructed using high-resolution fluoroscopy. These images can be used as real time references for any current or new medical procedures in which multiple frames of reference are required to perform medical procedures on or in the human body. Management believes that Imaging3 technology has extraordinary market potential in an almost unlimited number of medical applications, including:
Multi-function Device
 
A diagnostic medical imaging device built with Imaging3 technology can perform several functions and can potentially replace or supplement a number of existing devices, resulting in considerable cost savings for hospitals and healthcare centers. These functions include:

● | Perform real-time, 3D medical imaging; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Emulate a computerized tomography scanner (at a fraction of the capital cost); and 
● | Perform standard fluoroscopy. 

 
Our management believes that this multi-function capability will be especially attractive in foreign markets, where the cost of a computed tomography (“CT”) scanner is beyond the means of most hospitals and healthcare centers.
 
Existing Base of Business to Launch a Proprietary Product
 
Imaging3 is an established company with revenues and an industry reputation. While we began as a service provider, we quickly expanded to include equipment and parts sales, both new and renewed. Management believes that Imaging3 was one of the largest remanufacturer of C-arms in the world, prior to its bankruptcy in September 2012. We offered new, demonstration, remanufactured, refurbished, and pre-owned systems in all price ranges from every major manufacturer including OEC, General Electric, Philips, Siemens, FluoroScan, XiScan and Ziehm. We currently supply full-size, compact and mini C-arms.
Business and Revenue Models
 
Our business strategy is straight-forward: (1) maintain our base of C-arm remanufacturing and service business, and, assuming we achieve the FDA approval we are seeking: (2) develop medical diagnostic imaging devices based on our breakthrough Imaging3 technology for the $5 billion medical imaging market, (3) sell our new medical diagnostic imaging devices directly to healthcare providers, as well as through channel partners and distributors, and (4) license our breakthrough Imaging3 technology to other medical diagnostic imaging device manufacturers.
 
Our management believes that most of our future revenues will come from the sale of medical imaging devices, based on our Imaging3 technology. Other revenues are expected to be derived from the licensing of our proprietary technology to other medical diagnostic imaging device manufacturers. The smallest portion of our future revenue is projected to come from the sale and service of C-arms and tables.

Abstract of the Patent Disclosure
 
A computing device in a three-dimensional imaging system utilizes a plurality of distance readings and reference readings from at least one subject sensor to determine a subject location and a subject volume and establish a base three-dimensional map of a subject. A plurality of two-dimensional image exposures along with a plurality of associated reference locations are created by rotating an image source and an image receptor around an inner circumference of an imaging gantry. The plurality of two-dimensional image exposures is digitized to create a plurality of digital two-dimensional image exposures. The computing device receives the plurality of digital two-dimensional image exposures and the plurality of associated reference locations. The overlaying, interpolating and pasting of the plurality of digital two-dimensional image exposures on the base three-dimensional map creates a base three-dimensional image exposure, which is displayed on a display device.
 
General Description
 
Real-time 3D medical diagnostic imaging will be accomplished by scanning the patient, either partially or completely in a 360-degree circumference under fluoroscopy (or other type of image exposure), utilizing a single or multiple x-ray source and image receptor. The information acquired under fluoroscopy (or other type of image exposure) will be digitized at a frame rate of between 30 to 60 frames per second. This information will be sent to a computer system to be incorporated into a three-dimensional image to be displayed on a computer monitor. The image created can then be manipulated and/or rotated to view the scanned image of the patient’s anatomy in any direction or orientation desired by the user. The user could then choose a specific area of the image to update. Once an area is selected, the computer displaying the image would then “gang” or align the x-ray source(s) and image receptor(s) to begin updating scans of new images to be overlaid upon the existing three-dimensional model. This process would then be updated and/or repeated as many times as necessary for the specific procedure to be completed. At any time, a new reference area or scan could be selected or initiated.
The “O” Device
 
Part of our invention is based on an “O” device to create a circular gantry similar to that used with CT to scan a patient a full 360 degrees with fluoroscopic radiation. This approach is expected to allow imaging of the patient from any frame of reference or angulation (current medical imaging devices are limited to 150 degrees to 360 degrees with mechanical orientation or manipulation). 3D imaging requires an “O” device to scan the patient in increments of 360 degrees to allow construction of a three-dimensional image. By scanning the patient in 360 degrees and acquiring images at 30 to 60 frames per second, management believes a three-dimensional image can be constructed.
Imaging3 Technology Differs from Other Approaches
 
The “O” device approach is similar to that used in a CT scan. The difference is CT is used to image a “slice” of the anatomy and not intended for real-time fluoroscopic imaging. The slice is obtained by using a fulcrum reference point and rotating the X-ray source and image receptor in reference to that point. This basic geometry creates a 2D image in any depth desired, in any region of the body. The “O” device would use a similar fulcrum point to reference depth, but the scan would not create a slice but instead a real-time image captured at 30 to 60 frames per second in 360 degrees. Further, management believes that the “O” device would be used for conventional fluoroscopic imaging with the advantage of positioning the X-ray source and receptor at any angulation desired.

Currently, 3D imaging is used only for reconstructive post processing reference images. Magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), CT and ultrasound currently have this capability. The 3D images are created by multiple scans of 2D images that require a long period of time to process into a three-dimensional image. The image created is then used only for reference, not real-time manipulation in the body. We anticipate that our 3D images will be constructed almost instantly and will be available to be used as real-time references whenever multiple frames of reference are required to perform medical procedures on or in the human body.
 
The Market
 
We compete in the medical diagnostic imaging market and this market has never been healthier than it is today. This vitality is due primarily to continual technological improvements that lead to faster and better resolution imaging, greater patient safety, and the provision of these capabilities to a growing and aging population. The result has been a vigorous competition to create the most cost-effective diagnostic imaging systems.
 
Diagnostic imaging is an evolving part of modern medicine and is now entering a new era of digital imaging. The field has evolved from the early X-rays by Roentgen over 100 years ago to imaging of organs by CT and MRI that are 20 years old. Medical imaging is used for diagnosis in the leading causes of death, heart attacks, strokes, and cancer. What was once called the radiology department is now called the diagnostic imaging department because of the wealth of new technologies available beyond x-rays. A trauma victim’s internal injuries are imaged with a CT scanner. Breast cancer, a leading cause of death in women, is detected with mammography and ultrasound.
 
According to a Freedonia Group study, the medical imaging equipment market in the U.S. will register gains faster than the projected growth in national health expenditures. Growth is stimulated by an increasing incidence of patient procedures involving diagnostic imaging, partly the result of an aging population and partly reflecting advances in noninvasive imaging technology.
 
Our management believes that opportunities exist not only for new companies in imaging products but also for software companies for image processing and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems networks. Technological developments continue, which consistently result in new products.
 
Diagnostic imaging is an important part of medical diagnosis. It ranges from a dentist’s X-ray to find tooth decay to angiograms done to aid a cardiologist in performing an angioplasty. The aging baby boomer population will need the new imaging capabilities for cancer and heart disease detection. The revolution in medical imaging is being fueled not only by new medical imaging technology, but also by advances in computer hardware and software. New systems such as spiral CT or multi-slice CT would not be possible without today’s faster processors. Better software algorithms for image analysis and compression make the process more accurate and efficient. The growth of diagnostic imaging could be an important source of revenue for computer manufacturers and software companies specializing in diagnostic imaging.
 
Industry Overview
 
Diagnostic imaging services are noninvasive procedures that generate representations of the internal anatomy and convert them to film or digital media. Diagnostic imaging systems facilitate the early diagnosis of diseases and disorders, often minimizing the cost and amount of care required and reducing the need for costly and invasive diagnostic procedures.
Computed Tomography
 
In CT imaging, a computer analyzes the information received from an x-ray beam to produce multiple cross-sectional images of a particular organ or area of the body. CT imaging is used to detect tumors and other conditions affecting bones and internal organs.
Other Services
 
Other diagnostic imaging technologies include x-ray, single photon emission computed tomography, and ultrasound.
 
Digital Imaging Technologies
 
New techniques for the digital capture, display, storage, and transmission of x-ray images are poised to revolutionize the diagnostic imaging market. Although digital technologies and techniques have been in use in other diagnostic imaging areas (such as CT scans, MRI scans, and ultrasound), technical problems have kept x-ray technologies in the era of film. However, new methods of digitally capturing x-ray images are under development and promise to revolutionize x-ray imaging.
 
The need to cut costs and improve services in healthcare delivery is driving the move to digital systems. The requirement for hospitals to implement electronic access to medical images and other types of information is now widely accepted and regarded as inevitable. The trend toward storing, distributing and viewing medical images in digital form is being fueled by both changes in the economic structure of the healthcare system and by rapidly evolving technologies. In particular, the new economics of health
 
care will mandate a shift from film-based radiology to the electronic delivery of digital images, while new technology promises the additional benefit of vastly improved diagnostic power.
 
Users of Diagnostic Imaging
 
MRI and other imaging services are typically provided in one of the following settings:
 
Hospitals and Clinics
 
Imaging systems are located in and owned and operated by a hospital or clinic. These systems are primarily used for the patients of the hospital or clinic, and the hospital or clinic bills third-party payers, such as health insurers, Medicare or Medicaid.
Independent Imaging Centers
 
Imaging systems are located in permanent facilities not generally owned by hospitals or clinics. These centers depend upon physician referrals for their patients and generally do not maintain dedicated, contractual relationships with hospitals or clinics. In fact, these centers may compete with hospitals or clinics that have their own systems to provide Imaging3 to these patients. Like hospitals and clinics, these centers bill third-party payers for their services.

5
-

Outsourced
 
Imaging systems, largely located in mobile trailers but also provided in fixed facilities, provide services to a hospital or clinic on a shared-service or full-time basis. Generally, the hospital or clinic contracts with the imaging service provider to perform scans of its patients, and the imaging service provider is paid directly by that hospital or clinic instead of by a third-party payor.
Industry Challenges
 
In a recent report, U.S. Medical Imaging Industry Outlook, Frost & Sullivan identified several challenges facing the diagnostic imaging industry. Low reimbursement rates have become a major challenge, not only for end users, but for manufacturers as well. Imaging reimbursements for many procedures may be inadequate given the expense of the equipment and the expertise required to create and interpret results.
 
Lack of adequate compensation is a concern for all industry participants, as many healthcare centers are delaying or canceling purchases of high-priced items. Until the financial rewards for imaging are increased substantially, and definitively, low reimbursement will be the foremost hurdle for manufacturers.
 
Competition
 
Competitive Landscape
 
The healthcare industry in general and the market for imaging products in particular is highly competitive. We compete with a number of companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we have. Our competitors include large companies such as General Electric, Philips, Siemens, Toshiba and Hitachi, which compete in most medical diagnostic imaging modalities, including x-ray imaging.
 
A study by Theta Reports, Diagnostic Imaging Equipment and Systems World Market, identifies the following 17 key players in the medical diagnostic imaging market:

Direct Competitors
 
At this time, we are not aware of any existing devices in the marketplace that provide 3D, real-time diagnostic medical imaging, with the exception of ultrasound.
 
Ultrasound is a real-time tomographic imaging modality. Not only does it produce real-time tomograms of the position of reflecting surfaces (internal organs and structures), but it can also be used to produce real-time images of tissue and blood motion. However, ultrasound is a low-resolution imaging modality that does not produce an image as precise and clear as fluoroscopy. Our devices will rely instead on the use of fluoroscopy, a high-resolution imaging modality, to produce “live” x-ray images of living patients in 3D.
Marketing and Sales Plan
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Our marketing strategy is to create a favorable environment to sell our medical diagnostic imaging devices. We intend to enhance, promote and support the fact that Imaging3 technology is the most complete and comprehensive medical diagnostic imaging solution available in the marketplace.

Product and Service Differentiation
 
According to our management, the differentiating attributes of Imaging3 technology will include:
 

● | The only 3D, real-time medical diagnostic imaging device in the market that will produce high resolution images; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reasonably priced; 
● | Easy-to-install; 
● | Vast array of features; and 
● | Highly reliable. 

 
The Imaging3 medical device will be reasonably priced because it will cost considerably less than comparable MRI and CT Scan machines. It will be easy to install because it is lighter and will be more mobile than the MRI and CT Scan machines. It will have more features than MRI and CT Scan machines because it will provide 3D instant real time images and real time CT emulation, which the other machines currently do not provide. Management believes that the Imaging3 medical device will be more reliable than competing MRI and CT Scan machines because it needs less radiation to provide its 3D images, and its assembled components are simpler, more efficient, and standard (i.e. “off-the-shelf”), rather than customized.
 
Value Proposition
 
Our value proposition is simple: diagnostic imaging devices with Imaging3 technology allow healthcare providers to easily produce 3D, real-time, high resolution images at a reasonable cost.
 
Positioning
 
Management believes that Imaging3 can be positioned as offering the superior solution for producing medical diagnostic images. Management believes that our unique advantage is that we can offer a diagnostic imaging solution that will allow healthcare providers to view real-time references for virtually any procedure. We plan to reposition our competitors by demonstrating that their offerings are inadequate compared to our device because they:

● | Do not provide 3D images; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
● | Do not provide images in real-time; 
● | Do not provide comparable high resolution images; and 
● | Are too costly. 

Sales Strategy
 
After undertaking a marketing campaign, we intend to aggressively sell our medical diagnostic imaging devices in the United States. International sales efforts will follow after achieving market penetration in the domestic marketplace.
Sales Margin Structure
 
Our management believes that the majority of our sales will be derived from direct sales to customers, with the balance of sales derived from dealers and manufacturer’s representatives. As a result, the sales margin structure must be attractive to these independent organizations.

● | Direct Sales - Full suggested list price; 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Dealers - 30% off suggested list price; and 
● | Manufacturer’s Representatives - 10% commission.

Target Market Segment
 
Our management has identified general medical and surgical hospitals in the United States as our primary target market segment for Imaging3 technology. According to D&B/ iMarket, there are 12,041 general medical and surgical hospitals in the United States.
Distribution Channels
 
We plan to sell our Imaging3 medical diagnostic imaging devices through several channels of distribution, including:
 

7
-

Direct Sales to End Users
 
Our policy is to sell directly to end-users whenever possible. Our management expects that direct sales will occur most often with larger customers.
 
Dealers and Manufacturers’ Representatives
 
We plan to supplement our own field sales force by entering into agreements with dealers and manufacturers’ representatives. Because dealers and manufacturers’ representatives carry several product/service lines that are compatible with our products and services, Imaging3 plans to select dealers and manufacturers’ representatives carrying complementary and compatible products and services, as well as dealers and manufacturers’ representatives that sell dissimilar products and services yet are appropriate for their customers’ customer.
 
We have working relationships with a number of independent organizations that help distribute our current product line. We expect to work with these independent organizations to help distribute diagnostic medical imaging devices built with Imaging3 technology. These organizations have well-established relationships with mid-size to large size customers. Many also provide specific vertical market applications.
 
Executive Sales
 
Because many of Imaging3’s large customers will tend to be top healthcare managers, it is important that our president and senior managers present our products to our large customers.
Field Sales Force
 
Management anticipates that the majority of our selling efforts to large accounts will be handled internally through our field sales force. We have chosen to use a direct sales force because our large accounts require considerable customer education and post-sales support directly from us. Management believes that our price points, pricing structure and profits are such that our cost of sales warrants a “person-to-person” selling strategy.
Employees
 
We currently employ 2 full-time individuals, all of whom are working at our leased offices at 3022 North Hollywood Way, Burbank, California 91505. Both 2 full-time employees are executive officers and directors of the Company.
 
To support our need for technical staffing, we have established relationships with technical staffing organizations that continuously offer highly qualified personnel to meet our needs, both locally and from out of the area.
 
Intellectual Property Matters
 
Our policy is to have all of our employees execute agreements that impose nondisclosure obligations on the employee and in which the employee has assigned to us (to the extent permitted by California law) all copyrights and other inventions created by the employee during employment with us. The rights underlying the application for the patent of the Imaging3 technology have been assigned to us. We have in place a trade secret protection policy that our management believes to be adequate to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets.
Government Regulatory Approval Process
 
All of our products are classified as Class II (Medium Risk) devices by the FDA and clinical studies with our products will be considered to be Non-Significant Risk Studies, except that our 510(k) application with the FDA for our proprietary medical imaging device has not yet been approved as a Class II device. Imaging3’s business is governed by the FDA and all products typically require 510(k) market clearance before they can be put in commercial distribution. We are also regulated by the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulation, which is similar to the ISO9000 and the European EN46000 quality control regulations. All of our products currently in production or manufactured by other vendors are approved for marketing in the United States under the FDA’s 510(k) regulations.

8
-


A 510(k) is a pre-marketing submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to pre-market approval. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one or more similar devices currently on the U.S. market and make and support their substantial equivalency claims. A legally marketed device is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), or a device which has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent to such a device through the 510(k) process, or one established through Evaluation of Automatic Class III Definition. The legally marketed device(s) to which equivalence is drawn is known as the “predicate” device(s).
 
Applicants must submit descriptive data and when necessary, performance data to establish that their device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The data in a 510(k) is to show comparability, that is, substantially equivalent of a new device to a predicate device.
 
The FDA does not offer an opinion or determination of what submission is required. The FDA does provide a database of devices, classifications and Regulation numbers. In our research of this database we determined several Class II devices meet our criteria for submission. These devices are listed in the table below.
 

Product Code | Class | Description | Regulation | 
-----------------+-------+------------------------------------------+------------+---------
IZG | II | System, X-ray, Photofluorographic | | 892.1730
JAB | II | System, X-ray, Fluoroscopic, Non-Image-I | | 892.1660
JAK | II | System, X-ray, Tomography, Computed | | 892.175 

 
This is a broad range of devices with which to compare our device functionality. The FDA requires the manufacturer to submit an application, whether it is a 510(k) or pre-market approval submission. Upon receipt of the submission, the FDA will respond within 30 to 45 days with their determination of acceptance of the submission, questions and/or comments to the submission or requests for more information.
 
All of our current used rebuilt products are Class II devices, FDA approved through OEM for marketing. Once approved, the FDA will not require the manufacturer to resubmit an application or change the classification. They may, however, request further information about the product(s), manufacturer and GMP requirements. The devices currently sold by us are not manufactured by us. OEC Medical Systems is the original device manufacturer and responsible for the FDA submission of their original device(s). Imaging3 remanufactures OEC Medical Systems devices, thus we are not required to submit any FDA submission for these devices. In some instances, we have performed modifications to these devices to improve the devices functionality, and in these instances Imaging3 has submitted 510(k) applications. These modifications are to existing devices with existing classifications listed in the FDA database and cannot be reclassified. The FDA database listing for current products is listed below:
 

Product Code | Class | Description | Regulation | 
-----------------+-------+---------------------------+------------+---------
IZL | II | System, X-ray, Mobile | | 892.1720

 
As to our new product and its potential for classification, the FDA requires us, as the manufacturer, to submit an application in whichever classification we choose in the submission form we choose, meaning 510(k) or pre-market approval application. The FDA reviews the submission and determines whether the application is appropriately filed and in the correct submission format. The criteria they use for determination on a 510(k) is substantially equivalent, which is a comparative analysis of the manufacturer’s device in the submission with existing devices already approved by the FDA. This is the purpose of the FDA’s Device Classification Database, giving manufacturer’s products with approved submissions and categories of devices to compare new device submissions. A new type of device may not be found in the product classification database. If the device is a high risk device (supports or sustains human life, is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or presents a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury) and has been found to be not substantially equivalent to a Class I, II, or III (Class III requiring 510(k)), then a pre-market approval application will be required.
 
Our new product, the “Real-time 3D Imaging Device” is expected to be submitted as Product Code “IZG,” Device Class II, “System, X-ray, Photo fluorography,” Regulation Number 892.1730, since this is the closest device description.

The pre-market approval applicant is usually the person who owns the rights, or otherwise has authorized access, to the data and other information to be submitted in support of FDA approval. This person may be an individual, partnership, corporation, association, scientific or academic establishment, government agency or organizational unit, or other legal entity. The applicant is often the inventor/developer and ultimately the manufacturer.
 
FDA regulations provide 180 days to review the pre-market approval application and make a determination. In reality, the review time is normally longer. Before approving or denying a pre-market approval application, the appropriate FDA advisory committee may review the pre-market approval application at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether or not the FDA should approve the submission. After the FDA notifies the applicant that the pre-market approval application has been approved or denied, a notice is published on the Internet (1) announcing the data on which the decision is based, and (2) providing interested persons an opportunity to petition the FDA within 30 days for reconsideration of the decision.
 
A pre-market approval application is a scientific, regulatory documentation to the FDA to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Class II device. There are administrative elements of a pre-market approval application, but good science and scientific writing is a key to the approval of a pre-market approval application. If a pre-market approval application lacks elements listed in the administrative checklist, the FDA will refuse to accept a pre-market approval application and will not proceed with the in-depth review of scientific and clinical data. If a pre-market approval application lacks valid clinical information and scientific analysis based on sound scientific reasoning, it will delay the FDA’s review and approval. Pre-market approval applications that are incomplete, inaccurate, inconsistent, omit critical information, and are poorly organized have resulted in delays in consideration.
 
Three categories of the pre-market approval application are very important:
 
Technical Sections. The technical sections containing data and information should allow the FDA to determine whether to approve or disapprove the application. These sections are usually divided into non-clinical laboratory studies and clinical investigations.
 
Non-clinical Laboratory Studies’ Section. The non-clinical laboratory studies’ section includes information on microbiology, toxicology, immunology, biocompatibility, stress, wear, shelf life, and other laboratory or animal tests. Non-clinical studies for safety evaluation must be conducted in compliance with 21CFR Part 58 (Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies).
 
Clinical Investigations Section. The clinical investigations section includes study protocols, safety and effectiveness data, adverse reactions and complications, device failures and replacements, patient information, patient complaints, tabulations of data from all individual subjects, results of statistical analyses, and any other information from the clinical investigations. Any investigation conducted under an Investigational Device Exemption must be identified as such.
 
We are listed with the FDA as a new device manufacturer, our Registration Number is 20300565, and our Owner Operator Number is 9023393. Though we do not currently manufacture new devices, the FDA requires our registration as a remanufacturer. Imaging3 is subject to the FDA’s Radiological Health Program, under the Center for Devices Radiological Health division of the FDA.
 
We must be in compliance with Good Manufactures Practices (“GMP”), Quality Control, and Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”). The FDA may from time to time, usually every two to three years, audit us for compliance. In these audits the FDA reviews documents, interviews management and reviews all procedures.
 
The current GMP requirements set forth in the Quality System (“QS”) regulation are promulgated under Section 520 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (“FFD&C”) Act. They require that domestic or foreign manufacturers have a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for commercial distribution in the United States. The regulation requires that various specifications and controls be established for devices; that devices be designed under a quality system to meet these specifications; that devices be manufactured under a quality system; that finished devices meet these specifications; that devices be correctly installed, checked and serviced; that quality data be analyzed to identify and correct quality problems; and that complaints be processed. Thus, the QS regulation helps assure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended use. The FDA monitors device problem data and inspects the operations and records of device developers and manufacturers to determine compliance with the GMP requirements in the QS regulation.
 

10
--


The MDR regulation provides a mechanism for the FDA and manufacturers to identify and monitor significant adverse events involving medical devices. The goals of the regulation are to detect and correct problems in a timely manner. Although the requirements of the regulation can be enforced through legal sanctions authorized by the FFD&C Act, the FDA relies on the goodwill and cooperation of all affected groups to accomplish the objectives of the regulation.
 
The statutory authority for the MDR regulation is Section 519(a) of the FFD&C Act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 requires user facilities to report:
 


 | Device-related deaths to the FDA and the device manufacturer; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Device-related serious injuries to the manufacturer, or to the FDA if the manufacturer is not known; and 
● | Submit to the FDA on an annual basis a summary of all reports submitted during that period. 

 
When a problem arises with a product regulated by the FDA, the agency can take a number of actions to protect the public health. Initially, the agency works with the manufacturer to correct the problem voluntarily. If that fails, legal remedies include asking the manufacturer to recall a product, having federal marshals seize products if a voluntary recall is not done, and detaining imports at the port of entry until problems are corrected. If warranted, the FDA can ask the courts to issue injunctions or prosecute those that deliberately violate the law. When warranted, criminal penalties including prison sentences are sought.
 
Once on the market, there are post-market surveillance controls with which a manufacturer must comply. These requirements include the Quality Systems (also known as Good Manufacturing Practices), and Medical Device Reporting regulations. The QS regulation is a quality assurance requirement that covers the design, packaging, labeling and manufacturing of a medical device. The MDR regulation is an adverse event reporting program.
 
We are also required to report under the MDR requirements, which are for injuries and deaths, of which we have had none since our registration.
 
For all devices manufactured or remanufactured by us, the FDA may request updated information regarding any device with a previously approved 510(k) or pre-market approval submission. If any substantial changes are made to existing approved devices, the FDA may require a 510(k) supplement submission, which, in most cases, does not require the manufacturer to delay production or marketing of the modified device. As with all applications, this determination lies entirely with the FDA.
 
Our last audit with the FDA was in 2010 and we expect a new audit to take place shortly after our new device is resubmitted to the FDA in a 510(k) application.
 
In an audit performed by the FDA, our records for service and repair, quality control, device labeling and serial number tracking are reviewed. If the FDA finds issues of non-compliance they issue a letter requesting correction, giving us 30 days to correct the non-compliance. Extensions can be requested to reply, but most issues, if any, can be handled in a 30-day period.
 
Since our registration with the FDA in 1995, we have had two audits. We did not receive any notice or correspondence of non-compliance due to those audits. We received only one suggestion regarding our record keeping process, which addressed preventive maintenance forms being included in all customer files for which we provide service.
 
We have had no instances of non-compliance with either the FDA or the State of California. The consequences of non-compliance range from a letter stating non-compliance and a period to cure, suspension of manufacturing and distribution, to fines and suspension of operations.
 
We intend to seek to obtain FDA approval of our proprietary medical imaging device in 2017, although we cannot assure that this approval will be granted when expected. All of our marketing efforts for the new device must start from the date the FDA approves the device to be marketed. Since we are already registered with the FDA as a new device manufacturer and have been through an audit performed by the FDA, the FDA is already familiar with us and our processes. The FDA may wish to obtain updated information about us and may require more time to process our planned 510(k) resubmission than estimated.
 
To enter the European market, our products as well as our quality assurance systems will have to be approved and certified by an authorized certifying body such as Technischer Uberwachungsverein; English translation: Technical Inspection Association (“TUV”), Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) or British Standards Institute (“BSI”). In the future, we may plan to go through this process as a part of our overall enhancement of the quality systems.

TUV, UL and BSI are all standards testing companies assisting manufactures to comply with published standards, regulatory standards and laws necessary for marketing devices throughout the world and the United States. These three companies provide the UL and CE (the European equivalent of the UL mark in the United States) marks, demonstrating compliance with the standards and laws.
 
TUV is a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory and Safety Checklist Contractors certified, providing a full suite of services, including CE Marking assistance, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical & mechanical testing, and many additional global conformity assessment services that help companies gain product compliance to enter individual country markets.
 
UL is an independent, not-for-profit product-safety testing and certification organization. They have tested products for public safety for more than a century. Since their founding in 1894, they have held the undisputed reputation as a leader in product- safety testing and certification within the United States. Management believes that by building on their household name in the United States, UL is becoming one of the most recognized, reputable conformity assessment providers in the world. Today, their services extend to helping companies achieve global acceptance, whether for an electrical device, a programmable system, or an organization’s quality process.
 
BSI exists to help industry develop new and better products and to make sure that products meet current and future laws and regulations. It tests products from medical devices to fire extinguishers to lamps for football stadiums against published standards.
 
Far East, Middle East, Eastern European, and Latin American markets have different regulatory requirements. We intend to comply with applicable requirements if and when we decide to enter those markets.
 
Other Government Regulations
 
The delivery of health care services has become one of the most highly regulated of professional and business endeavors in the United States. Both the federal government and individual state governments are responsible for overseeing the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the delivery of health care services. Federal law and regulations are based primarily upon the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Each of these programs is financed, at least in part, with federal funds. State jurisdiction is based upon the state’s interest in regulating the quality of health care in the state, regardless of the source of payment. We believe that we are materially complying with applicable laws, however, we have not received or applied for a legal opinion from counsel or from any federal or state judicial or regulatory authority. Additionally, many aspects of our business have not been the subject of state or federal regulatory interpretation. The laws applicable to us are subject to evolving interpretations. If our operations are reviewed by a government authority, we may receive a determination that could be adverse to us. Furthermore, laws that are applicable to us may be amended in a manner that could adversely affect us.
 
Only a small portion of our revenues come through a government system. Virtually all of our revenues are obtained from sales and service to vendees who pay us directly. We have not been subject to Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federally funded health care program.
