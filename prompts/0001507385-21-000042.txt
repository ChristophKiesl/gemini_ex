Overview
VEREIT is a full-service real estate operating company which owns and actively manages one of the largest portfolios of single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. and has a business model of providing equity capital to creditworthy organizations in return for long-term leases on their properties. As discussed in further detail below, our full-service real estate operations include portfolio management through strategic acquisitions and dispositions, property management, asset management and leasing. The Company has 3,831 retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate properties with an aggregate of 89.7 million square feet of which 97.9% was leased, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.3 years. Omitting the square feet of one redevelopment property and including the pro rata share of square feet and annualized rental income from the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures, we owned an aggregate of 89.5 million square feet, of which 98.1% was leased, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.4 years as of December 31, 2020. Of VEREIT’s 3,831 properties, annualized rental income as a percentage of the total portfolio was approximately 45% retail, 20% restaurant, 17% office, 18% industrial and 0.1% other. Our properties are located throughout the U.S. (including Puerto Rico) with the two highest concentrations in the Southeast and Midwest regions. 
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no tenants exceeding 10% of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, properties located in Texas represented 12.1% and 12.8%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of each of December 31, 2020 and 2019, tenants in the casual dining restaurant industry accounted for 12.0% of our consolidated annualized rental income. 
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company operated through two business segments, the real estate investment segment and the investment management segment, Cole Capital. The Company completed the sale of Cole Capital on February 1, 2018. The assets, liabilities and related financial results of substantially all of the Cole Capital segment are reflected in the financial statements as discontinued operations. Following the sale of Cole Capital, the Company's financial results are reported as a single segment for all periods presented. 
VEREIT, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Maryland on December 2, 2010 and has elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Substantially all of our real estate operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership, of which VEREIT, Inc. is the sole general partner. VEREIT Inc. is the holder of 99.9% of the common partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (the “OP Units”) as of December 31, 2020. The Operating Partnership was formed in the State of Delaware on January 13, 2011. VEREIT, Inc.’s shares of common stock (“Common Stock”) and 6.70% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the trading symbols “VER” and “VER PRF,” respectively. 
The Company effected a one-for-five reverse stock split of shares of Common Stock after markets closed on December 17, 2020. Certain prior period amounts have been updated to reflect the reverse stock split. A corresponding reverse split of the outstanding OP Units also took effect on December 17, 2020. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 – Equity for further discussion.

Primary Investment Focus
We own and actively manage a diversified portfolio of single-tenant retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate assets subject to long-term net leases with creditworthy tenants. Our focus is on single-tenant, net-leased properties that are strategically located and essential to the business operations of the tenant, as well as retail properties that offer necessity and value-oriented products or services. We actively manage the portfolio by considering several metrics including property type, tenant concentration, geography, credit and key economic factors for appropriate balance and diversity. We believe that actively managing our portfolio allows us to attain the best operating results for each asset and the overall portfolio through strategic planning, implementation of these plans and responding proactively to changes and challenges in the marketplace.
Investment Policies
When evaluating prospective investments in or dispositions of real property, management considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property and business operations of the tenant, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. In this regard, our management has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject in certain instances to the approval of the Board of Directors.
As part of our overall portfolio strategy, we seek to lease space and/or acquire properties leased to creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting and operating guidelines. Prior to entering into any transaction, our corporate credit analysis and underwriting professionals conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality. In addition, we consistently monitor the credit quality of our portfolio by actively reviewing the creditworthiness of certain tenants, focusing primarily on those tenants representing the greatest concentration of our portfolio. This review primarily includes an analysis of the tenant’s financial statements either quarterly, or as frequently as the lease permits. We also consider tenant credit quality when assessing our portfolio for strategic dispositions. When we assess tenant credit quality, we, among other factors that we may deem relevant: (i) review relevant 
financial information, including financial ratios, net worth, revenue, cash flows, leverage and liquidity; (ii) evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant’s management team; and (iii) assess the strength/growth of the tenant’s industry. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant’s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental revenue for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric) including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We are of the opinion that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base, our review of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants and mitigation options.
Financing Policies
We rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns. We intend to finance future acquisitions with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, unsecured corporate-level debt, and other public, private or bank debt. In addition, we may acquire properties in exchange for the issuance of Common Stock or OP Units and we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. 
We also may obtain secured or unsecured debt to acquire properties, and we expect that our financing sources will include the public debt market, banks and institutional investment firms, including asset managers and life insurance companies. Although we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure, our charter does not contain a specific limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and the Board of Directors may implement or change target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.
We intend to continue to emphasize unsecured corporate-level or OP-level debt in our financing and to seek to reduce the percentage of our assets which are secured by mortgage loans. For information relating to our Credit Facility, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Competition 
We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties. We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. We also may face new competitors and, due to our focus on single-tenant properties located throughout the United States, and because many of our competitors are locally or regionally focused, we do not expect to encounter the same competitors in each region of the United States. Our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments and may succeed in buying the properties that we have targeted for acquisition and may succeed in disposing of or leasing properties similar to ours for lower sale or rental rates. Foreign investors may view the U.S. real estate market as being more stable than other international markets and may increase investments in high-quality single-tenant properties, especially in gateway cities. We may also incur costs in connection with unsuccessful acquisitions that we will not be able to recover. 
Regulations
Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”). See “Item 1A - Risk Factors” for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted all states where our tenants operate their businesses or where our properties are located. Our business and our tenants’ businesses have been impacted and may continue to be impacted by measures taken to control the COVID-19 outbreak (including “shelter-in-place” or “stay-at-home” orders, density limitations 
and social distancing orders (collectively, “Closure Orders”), and other mandates issued by local, state or federal authorities) as well as state, local or industry-initiated efforts to freeze tenant rent or suspend or modify the process by which a landlord can enforce evictions. These measures have affected and may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent. While we believe our tenants generally do not have a clear contractual right to cease paying rent due to government-mandated closures and we intend to enforce our rights under the lease agreements, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related governmental orders continue to present novel situations for which the ultimate legal outcome cannot be assured and it is possible future governmental action could impact our rights under the lease agreements.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 160 employees. We value our employees and their individual and collective contributions to the Company in the furtherance of our corporate, operational, social, environmental and governance initiatives. Our company culture is based on treating others the way we would like to be treated and we strive to foster a work environment that is inclusive, fair and engaged. 
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key members of our executive and senior management teams and staff supporting our continuing operations. We have developed robust benefit programs focused on the recruitment and retention of employees. These benefit programs include, but are not limited to, competitive compensation packages, health and welfare benefits, life and disability insurance, 401(k) plan matching, and parental leave, along with programs focused on employee training and education, wellness, assistance and engagement. We also encourage employees to become more proficient in their jobs and prepare for greater responsibility by offering reimbursement to employees seeking professional certifications, designations or licenses. Further, we have a commitment to providing equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and we do not discriminate against any person based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, genetic information or any other basis made unlawful by federal, state or local law, ordinance or regulation.
In addition, as a result of COVID-19, the Company implemented and is continuing its work-from-home policy to protect its employees. The Company maintains a strong commitment to supporting its employees’ health through the pandemic and has instituted safety protocols and procedures for employees when they are in a Company office. 
The Company empowers employees to strengthen their communities and to support their local social programs. To further this initiative, the Company established the VEREIT Values Program in 2015 whose mission is to connect employees with charitable organizations in their communities. Since its inception, employees have contributed time and resources to various charitable organizations.
