  Overview 
         We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immuno-oncology therapies that are designed to harness the immune system to attack cancer cells. Since we began operations in November 2014, we have built a pipeline of four immuno-oncology programs, three of which focus on the adenosine-cancer axis to modulate an immune response. Our lead product candidate, CPI-444, is an oral, small molecule antagonist of the A2A receptor for adenosine, an immune checkpoint. In January 2016, we began enrolling patients in a large expansion cohort trial for CPI-444. This Phase 1/1b clinical trial is designed to examine safety, tolerability, biomarkers and preliminary efficacy of CPI-444 in several solid tumor types, both as a single agent and in combination with Genentech, Inc.'s investigational cancer immunotherapy, TecentriqÂ® (atezolizumab), a fully humanized investigational monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1. In November 2016, we completed enrollment of 48 patients in the first step of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial, which was designed to determine the optimal dose of CPI-444 as both a single agent therapy and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for use in the cohort expansion component of the trial. The expansion cohort portion of the trial is now enrolling patients with different types of solid tumors at 36 leading medical centers in the U.S., Australia and Canada. The other product and development candidates in our pipeline also continue to advance. We have chosen a lead development candidate for our second program, an anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody ("CPX-006") that inhibits the production of adenosine. CPX-006 is currently in IND enabling studies and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in early 2018. In addition, in 2016 we selected a development candidate for our ITK program and are currently conducting IND-enabling studies. We also plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for this candidate in 2018. We expect to select a development candidate for our other program, a small molecule antagonist of the A2B receptor for adenosine in 2017. We believe the breadth and status of our pipeline demonstrates our management team's expertise in understanding and developing immuno-oncology assets as well as in identifying product candidates that can be in-licensed and further developed internally to treat many types of cancer. We hold worldwide rights to all of our product candidates. 
         Immuno-oncology therapies that stimulate or enhance immune responses to tumors are a new and emerging approach with several potential benefits over existing therapies. First, the immune system exhibits immunologic diversity and selectivity, which enables it to respond selectively to a large number of potential targets. Second, once triggered, the immune response can be amplified, offering the potential to enhance the efficacy of treatment. Third, once activated, the immune system possesses immunologic memory, potentially providing for a durable and long-lasting response. Some of the most successful types of immuno-oncology therapies are immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune checkpoints are signaling molecules produced by or expressed on immune cells that act to shut down or block an immune response. In a healthy person, these checkpoints function to limit an immune response to ensure that the immune system does not overreact, which could lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage, as occurs in patients with autoimmune diseases or allergies. Tumor cells have evolved to activate these checkpoints to shield the tumor from immune response attacks, but studies have shown that immune checkpoint inhibitors can counter these tumor-protective measures and unleash the immune system's cancer-destroying properties. 
         The FDA has approved agents that target specific immune checkpoints, including antibodies against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 ("CTLA-4"), programmed death 1 ("PD-1") receptors, and programmed death receptor-ligand 1 ("PD-L1"). These antibodies represent the first immune checkpoint inhibitors to demonstrate effectiveness in the clinic, and preclinical data suggest 
 1

   that there are many other immune checkpoints or targets that may be modulated to promote the activation of a patient's anti-tumor immune system. 
         Since we began operations in November 2014, we have built a pipeline of four immuno-oncology programs. Three of our programs are aimed at disabling cancer's ability to subvert immune attack by inhibiting adenosine in the tumor microenvironment or by blocking its production by tumors. Adenosine activates an immune checkpoint, the adenosine A2A receptor, that is used by the body to limit inflammation and immune responses. Adenosine accomplishes this by interacting with the A2A and A2B receptors expressed on several cells of the immune system; including T-cells, natural killer ("NK") cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, as well as other cells. We are developing small molecules that selectively inhibit the binding of adenosine to either A2A receptors or to A2B receptors. We also are developing injectable monoclonal antibodies that block the production of adenosine by tumors by inhibiting the cell surface enzyme CD73. Our fourth program is aimed at developing product candidates that regulate T-cell activation and differentiation by inhibiting interleukin-2 inducible kinase ("ITK"). Several of our product candidates are orally administered small molecules, which may provide for easier administration and facilitate their use in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Our oral product candidates are designed to be rapidly eliminated from the body, which, in turn, could reduce the potential for excessive toxicity when used in combination with other antibody-based checkpoint inhibitors. 
         Our immuno-oncology product candidate pipeline includes the following: 
  CPI-444 Adenosine A2A Receptor Antagonist.    In February 2015, we in-licensed patent rights and know-how related to CPI-444 and related molecules from Vernalis (R&D) Limited ("Vernalis"), where it was under development for treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurologic diseases. Vernalis and its corporate partner conducted two Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and one Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with an aggregate of approximately 75 healthy volunteers and patients dosed. These trials provided early indications of a favorable safety profile and assessed pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability and receptor occupancy for CPI-444. We conducted further testing in in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate CPI-444's immune-enhancing and anti-tumor properties. In these studies, orally administered CPI-444 inhibited tumor growth in multiple mouse models of cancer as a single agent, in combination with anti-PD-1 agents and in combination with anti-PD-L1 agents. 
         In October 2015, we filed an investigational new drug ("IND") application for CPI-444 for treatment of several solid tumor types. In January 2016, we began enrolling patients in a large expansion cohort clinical trial for CPI-444. This Phase 1/1b clinical trial is designed to examine safety, tolerability, biomarkers and preliminary efficacy of CPI-444, both as a single agent and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab), and includes patients with different types of solid tumors enrolled in disease-specific cohorts. 
         In November 2016, we completed enrollment of the first step of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial, which was designed to determine the optimal dose for use in the disease-specific expansion cohort component of the trial. We also reported results of initial safety, tolerability, biomarkers and preliminary efficacy. In December 2016, we initiated the second step of the Phase 1 /1b clinical trial with our optimal dose of CPI-444 as both a single agent therapy and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab). This portion of the trial is now enrolling patients in ten disease specific cohorts; five of the cohorts receive CPI-444 as a single agent and five receive CPI-444 in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab). The cohorts include patients with non-small cell lung cancer, malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and others (bladder cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer with high mutation rates). 
         The issued U.S. patents that we in-licensed from Vernalis are directed to the composition of matter of CPI-444 and its method of use for treating disorders treatable by purine receptor blocking. 
 2

   The composition of matter patent covering CPI-444 is expected to expire in the United States in July 2029, excluding any patent term extension that may be available. We hold an exclusive, worldwide license under these patent rights and related know-how, including a limited right to grant sublicenses, for all fields of use, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing certain adenosine receptor antagonists, including CPI-444. 
  Anti-CD73 Adenosine Production Inhibitor.    In December 2014, we in-licensed from The Scripps Research Institute ("Scripps") a mouse hybridoma clone expressing an anti-human CD73 antibody, from which we have developed our lead product candidate, CPX-006, a humanized anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody. We have further modified CPX-006 to improve binding to CD73 and maximize its inhibition of catalytic activity. CD73 is often found on lymphocytes, tumors and other tissues and is believed to play an important role in tumor immune suppression by catalyzing the production of extracellular adenosine. In preclinical in vitro studies, our humanized monoclonal anti-CD73 antibody has been shown to inhibit the catalytic activity of CD73, resulting in the blocking of extracellular adenosine production by tumor cells, which we believe could stimulate or enhance immune response to tumors. In 2016, we initiated IND-enabling studies for CPX-006 for potential clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and, subject to the completion of such studies and the submission and acceptance by the FDA of an IND, we plan to begin a Phase 1 clinical trial in early 2018. We hold a non-exclusive, world-wide license for all fields of use under Scripps' rights in a hybridoma clone expressing an anti-CD73 antibody, and to progeny, mutants or unmodified derivatives of such hybridoma and any antibodies expressed by such hybridoma. In 2016, we filed a patent application covering the composition of matter of CPX-006. 
  Adenosine A2B Receptor Antagonist.    We have in-licensed several selective and potent adenosine A2B receptor antagonists from Vernalis. In addition, we are synthesizing and have identified other A2B receptor antagonists from our internal research program. Adenosine A2B receptors have recently been found to play an important role in the immune response to tumors. Similar to adenosine A2A receptors, adenosine binds to adenosine A2B receptors, which leads to immunosuppression. We intend to further develop our A2B agents to improve potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic behavior and immune enhancing properties. We expect to conduct preclinical studies similar to those we have conducted for CPI-444 in order to select a development candidate in 2017. Upon selection, we intend to conduct further IND-enabling studies and potential Phase 1 clinical trials. We hold an exclusive, worldwide license under certain Vernalis patent rights and know-how, including a limited right to grant sublicenses, for all fields of use to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing such compounds that have been developed using the intellectual property rights that we in-license from Vernalis. 
         ITK Inhibitor.    We are currently developing a series of selective, covalent inhibitors of ITK and are evaluating them in preclinical studies for potency, safety and efficacy. ITK, an enzyme that functions in T-cell signaling and differentiation, is expressed predominantly in T-cells, which are lymphocytes that play a vital role in immune responses. One of the key survival mechanisms of tumors is believed to be the reprogramming of T-cells to create an inflammatory environment that inhibits anti-tumor immune response and favors tumor growth. We believe highly selective inhibitors of this enzyme will facilitate induction of T-cell anti-tumor immunity and also may be useful in the treatment of T-cell lymphomas. In 2016, we selected a lead development candidate for this program and initiated IND-enabling studies. Subject to the completion of such studies and the submission and acceptance by the FDA of an IND, we plan to advance the candidate into Phase 1 clinical trials in cancer patients in 2018. We have filed patent applications covering composition of matter and uses of our ITK inhibitors and hold exclusive worldwide rights for all indications.

     Our Company Origins and Team 
         Since we began operations in November 2014, our focus has been on improving and expanding upon the recent success achieved with immune checkpoint inhibitors and on developing agents to new targets in the evolving immuno-oncology field. Our founders and management team consist of industry veterans who have played significant roles in the discovery and development of successful oncology and immunology antibodies and drugs, including rituximab and ibrutinib. Our co-founders include our Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Miller, M.D., our Chief Financial Officer, Leiv Lea, and our Executive Vice President, Discovery Research, Joseph Buggy, Ph.D. Dr. Miller previously co-founded IDEC (which merged to form Biogen IDEC, now Biogen), where he led research efforts on lymphoma, culminating in the development of rituximab. Dr. Miller, an oncologist, also co-founded and was the initial CEO of Pharmacyclics, Inc. where he and colleagues in-licensed ibrutinib and, together with Dr. Buggy, led its development. Our Chief Financial Officer, Leiv Lea, has previously led finance teams for emerging biotechnology companies, including Pharmacyclics. Mr. Lea has extensive commercial and operating experience in addition to having completed a number of financial and strategic transactions. In 2016, Jason Coloma, Ph.D., was hired as our Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer. Dr. Coloma previously led oncology business development efforts for Roche. In addition, we have recruited industry veterans and experts to join our management team, and established collaborations with leading biotechnology companies, including Genentech, and collaborative relationships with research institutions, including The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. With our management team's expertise in developing both small molecule and antibody-based oncology treatments, we believe we are well positioned to identify and develop novel therapeutic agents that have diverse but complementary mechanisms of action, allowing for their potential integration into immuno-oncology treatment regimens for a broad variety of cancers. 
 Our Strategy 
         Our goal is to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology treatments for multiple cancer indications. Specific elements of our strategy are: 
 

ÂLeverage our expertise in immunology and oncology to identify, develop and commercialize new product
candidates.  We have established development expertise and capabilities in synthetic chemistry, molecular biology, immunology and clinical
oncology, which we believe will help us advance product candidates in the immuno-oncology field. We plan to become a leader in the development and commercialization of product candidates targeting
adenosine in what is known as the adenosine-cancer axis, a key mechanism used by tumors to evade immune attack. Three of our product programs, each of which was in-licensed, are focused on the
development of product candidates targeting this axis, including an A2A receptor antagonist, an anti-CD73 antibody and an A2B receptor antagonist. We intend to seek opportunities to in-license
additional product candidates with a focus on the potential to address unmet needs within our areas of expertise. 
ÂUtilize efficient clinical trial designs to enable us to identify the most promising clinical
indications.  Our Phase 1/1b clinical trial is designed to evaluate multiple variables, such as single agent and combination therapy,
impact of prior therapy with immune-oncology agents and the role of various biomarkers, which may allow us to determine tumor types that are most responsive to treatment with CPI-444 alone or in
combination. This approach has the potential to shorten development time by quickly identifying the most promising clinical indications, which would then be evaluated in subsequent definitive pivotal
trials. For instance, In January 2017, the protocol-predefined criteria for expansion in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial for CPI-444 was reached for the cohort of patients with renal cell
carcinoma treated with single-agent CPI-444. Accordingly, the size of that cohort has been increased from 14 to 26 patients. We intend to use similar clinical trial designs for our other product
candidates in the future.

Â Advance product candidates for use alone or in combination with other oncology
treatments.  We intend to focus on product candidates with single agent activity, which are also designed to be combined synergistically with
other cancer therapies. We believe that many immuno-oncology therapeutic regimens will likely be built on a backbone of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and our initial Phase 1/1b clinical trial
includes the administration of CPI-444 in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab). Our product candidates are designed to target the patient's immune system rather than a specific type of malignant
cell, and, if approved, could be suitable as a single agent as well as in combination with current and future immunotherapy agents as well as traditional cancer treatments, including chemotherapy,
biologic therapy, targeted therapy and radiation therapy. 
Â Identify biomarkers to select patients and monitor treatment with our product
candidates.  Predicting optimal drug responses in patients requires the identification and validation of predictive biomarkers. We believe that
developing the ability to identify patient subsets most likely to respond to our product candidates will increase the clinical benefit to patients and improve the probability of success of our
clinical trials. Our Phase 1/1b clinical trial of CPI-444 includes the examination of numerous biomarkers to identify those that may correlate with clinical efficacy and increase our likelihood
of success. 
Â Pursue collaborative relationships, partnerships and in-licensing opportunities to help
advance and expand our product candidate portfolio.  In addition to developing product candidates through preclinical and clinical stages of
development, we plan to identify and pursue strategic collaborative relationships, partnerships and in-licensing opportunities, which could enhance the development of our programs and product
candidates. As evidenced by our collaboration with Genentech for CPI-444, we intend to build upon our relationships with leading biotechnology companies and research institutions to identify new
opportunities to position us at the forefront of immuno-oncology. 

 Cancer Treatment and Immuno-oncology 
         Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the United States, accounting for nearly one in every four deaths. Approximately 40% of Americans will develop some form of cancer, and, according to the American Cancer Society, there were 1.7 million new cases of cancer and 595,000 deaths due to cancer in the United States in 2016. Cancer treatment has traditionally included chemotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation, surgery or a combination of these approaches. Treatment with targeted agents is becoming more widely used. These agents often react with specifically mutated proteins in cancer. Many different mutations are now known to occur frequently in cancer and, in many cases, are responsible for driving tumor progression. 
         Immuno-oncology is a new and emerging approach to treating cancer that is based on stimulating or enhancing an immune response to the tumor. This approach is based on the findings that the mutations occurring in cancer cells may be immunogenic and capable of eliciting an immune response against the tumor. Immuno-oncology therapies offer several potential advantages over existing cancer therapies due to the intrinsic features of the immune system. For instance, the immune system exhibits immunologic diversity and selectivity, which enables it to respond to a large number of potential targets. In addition, once triggered, the immune response can be amplified, offering the potential to enhance the efficacy of treatment. Furthermore, once activated, the immune system possesses immunologic memory, potentially providing for a durable and long-lasting response. Finally, because immunotherapy mechanisms are indifferent to tissue origin and are instead focused on immunogenic mutations, which are often expressed across tumor types, immunotherapy may be widely applicable to many types of cancer and not limited to a particular tumor type. This allows for these agents to be potentially active in a multitude of cancer histologies. However, while the modulation of the immune system to eradicate cancer has been a long-standing goal in cancer therapy, historically it has not been 
 5

   possible to consistently produce clinically meaningful anti-tumor immune responses despite the immunogenicity of tumors. 
         Recently, the reasons for the previous failures of immunologic approaches to cancer treatment have become better understood. Tumors evolve sophisticated survival mechanisms, allowing them to avoid immune-mediated destruction as occurs with pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses. These mechanisms include the activation of immune checkpoints on cells of the immune system, which act to block immune responses, and the reprogramming of T-cells to create an inflammatory environment that inhibits immune response and favors tumor growth. Immune checkpoints are signaling molecules produced by or expressed on immune cells that shut down or block an immune response. In a healthy person, these checkpoints function to limit an immune response to ensure that the immune system does not overreact, which could lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage, as occurs in patients with autoimmune diseases or allergies. Tumors have evolved to activate these checkpoints to shield them from immune response attacks. However, studies have shown that these mechanisms can be countered using immune checkpoint inhibitors, which can unleash the immune system's cancer-destroying properties. The new found understanding of immune checkpoints has led to a revolution in cancer treatment and the growing field of immuno-oncology. Specific immune checkpoint inhibitors, including antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1 receptor or its ligand PD-L1 have produced impressive results in the clinic in a range of cancers, leading to FDA approvals for ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), nivolumab (anti-PD-1), pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) and atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1). 
         Despite their recent success, current checkpoint inhibitors suffer from several limitations. Only a minority of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors exhibit robust anti-tumor responses, and most responses are partial and temporary. Many patients initially respond, but then relapse due to the emergence of resistant pathways, which may occur due to tumor cell expression of other checkpoints. Some patients experience unusual toxicities related to an over-exhuberant immune response against normal tissues leading to pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis and other autoimmune related disorders. These limitations have motivated a search for other immune checkpoint targets and the use of combinations of various checkpoint inhibitors in an attempt to improve efficacy, reduce resistance and limit or reduce toxicity. To date, the use of combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been limited by excessive and serious autoimmune toxicities. 
         The recent success of checkpoint inhibitors has stimulated increased interest in utilizing various immunotherapy approaches to treating cancer, including vaccines, cellular therapies and other immunomodulatory agents. These approaches include modulating the function of various immune cells. For example, ibrutinib, an FDA approved BTK inhibitor, is currently being evaluated as an immunomodulatory agent in solid tumors because it is believed to also affect the differentiation of T-cells. 
   Product Pipeline 
         We are developing novel checkpoint inhibitors and immuno-oncology therapies that we believe may overcome some of the limitations of current immuno-oncology therapies. Three of our programs are aimed at disabling cancer's ability to subvert immune attack by inhibiting adenosine in the tumor microenvironment or by blocking its production by tumors. Our fourth program is aimed at developing product candidates that regulate T-cell activation and differentiation by inhibiting ITK, an enzyme important in T cell differentiation and function. We intend to commercialize any approved product candidates primarily in the United States and Europe for any oncology indications our product candidates are approved for. We expect cancer patients or their healthcare providers to be our primary customers for any approved product candidates and expect that our commercial sales of such product candidates will depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors.

  Adenosine Inhibitors 
   Adenosine-Cancer Axis and Anti-tumor Immune Response 
         Adenosine activates an immune checkpoint, the adenosine A2A receptor, that is used by the body to limit inflammation and immune responses. It is produced during acute, inflammatory processes in two steps. The first step is the catalytic conversion of adenosine triphosphate ("ATP") to adenosine monophosphate ("AMP") by the enzyme CD39. The second and rate-limiting step is the conversion of AMP to adenosine by CD73, an enzyme expressed on the surface of several types of immune cells, tumor cells and cells of certain other tissues. Under normal circumstances, the level of adenosine is increased to protect a person from over-injury in response to such stimuli as inflammation, infection or ischemia. However, as a self-protective maneuver, many tumor types actively sustain increased levels of extracellular adenosine by production through CD73 or by direct secretion of adenosine. These increased levels of adenosine interact with the A2A and A2B receptors expressed on several cells of the immune system, including T-cells, NK cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, as well as other cells, which has the effect of dampening the immune response to the tumor, a system known as the adenosine-cancer axis.

        The following figure provides an overview of adenosine production by tumors and its effects on the immune system: 
      Adenosine-Cancer Axis Immunosuppressive Effects of Adenosine Mediated through Multiple Pathways 

        The immune system is composed of several cellular components that mediate a variety of functions in response to tumor cells and foreign pathogens. For instance, macrophages and dendritic cells function primarily to process foreign antigens and tumor antigens. These cells then present such antigens to other cells, such as T-cells. The presentation of these antigens to T-cells stimulates cytotoxic T-cells (also known as killer T-cells) to destroy the tumor cells or foreign pathogens. Other cells, such as NK cells, are capable of destroying tumor cells without the need for antigen presentation from macrophages or dendritic cells. In addition, certain immune cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells and T regulatory cells, function to suppress or dampen immune responses. The various cellular components of the immune system work in a coordinated manner to recognize and destroy pathogens and tumor cells, and then return the tissue to its normal state. 
         Adenosine hinders the immune response to tumors by both blocking the activation and effectiveness of immune cells capable of destroying tumor cells, and by increasing the number of immune cells that act to suppress immune cells from responding to the tumor. For instance, adenosine reduces T-cell and NK cell production of cytokines, such as interleukin-2 ("IL-2") and gamma interferon ("IFNg"), which results in the blockade or reduction in the ability of such cells to destroy tumor cells. Adenosine also leads to activation and proliferation of T regulatory cells, which function to suppress or dampen immune responses. In addition, adenosine causes dendritic cells to both decrease the rate at which they present antigens to T-cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of T-cells to destroy tumor cells, and decrease their production of co-stimulatory cytokines, which also has the effect of suppressing or dampening the immune response. Macrophages exposed to adenosine will similarly decrease their function, which results in the suppression of immune activity. Finally, adenosine stimulates and increases the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment, which suppresses immune responses to the tumor. As tumor cells evolve and form cancerous growths, they utilize these processes to evade immune attack and promote their survival. Many of the effects of adenosine on the immune system are mediated through binding to A2A 
 8

   receptors present on several immune cells. Much less is known about A2B receptors, but they have recently been found on certain immune cells, such as macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells, and adenosine binding to A2B receptors also appears to play a role in tumor induced immune suppression. 
         Cancer cells also appear to directly utilize adenosine to promote their own growth. Many solid tumors upregulate CD73 for increased adenosine production. In some cases, it appears adenosine can stimulate growth in tumors by increasing a tumor's blood supply. 
         A significant body of data indicates that targeting the adenosine-cancer axis through the A2A receptor can promote anti-tumor immune responses leading to tumor regression. Consistent with studies of the inhibition of the A2A receptor, A2A receptor gene knockout mice, which completely lack expression of the A2A receptor, exhibit improved anti-tumor immunity. In addition, several preclinical tumor model studies have shown that treatment with A2A receptor inhibitors leads to tumor regression that is enhanced when administered in combination with various other checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 therapies and anti-CTLA-4 therapies. 
   Lead Product Candidate: CPI-444, an A2A selective, orally administered antagonist of the adenosine A2A receptor 
   Overview 
         Our lead product candidate, CPI-444, is a selective oral adenosine A2A receptor antagonist that we licensed from Vernalis in February 2015. This molecule was under development for treatment of Parkinson's and other neurologic diseases. Studies conducted by Vernalis and its corporate partner, Biogen IDEC, showed that A2A receptor antagonists were relatively safe and well-tolerated. Three human clinical trials involving approximately 75 healthy volunteers and patients with ADHD were conducted previously with CPI-444 by Vernalis and Biogen IDEC, of whom 43 received single doses and 54 received once-daily or twice-daily doses for up to 14 days. One of these, a randomized, Phase 1b, double-blind, cross-over, placebo controlled trial in 28 patients with ADHD, was conducted in the United States from 2013 to 2014 under an IND. At the time, little was known about the A2A receptor and the potential effects of adenosine on the immune system, and these studies did not attempt to measure effects of treatment on immune cells or on immune function. 
         Since licensing CPI-444, we have conducted extensive laboratory studies in vitro and in vivo in animal models to evaluate CPI-444's immune-enhancing and anti-tumor properties. In these studies, orally administered CPI-444 inhibited tumor growth in multiple mouse models of cancer as a single agent, in combination with anti-PD-1, in combination with anti-PD-L1, in combination with other immune-oncology agents and in combination with certain chemotherapy drugs. We also have shown in vitro that CPI-444 binds potently and selectively to human activated T-cells and blocks adenosine mediated immunosuppression by restoring T-cell function. In addition, we have shown that there is anti-tumor activity in mice for a significant time following oral administration, which appears to be mediated through a long-lasting memory immune response. Furthermore, we have shown in animal models that the treatment is well tolerated. Our IND in oncology was filed in October 2015, and we began enrolling patients in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial in January 2016. 
 Human Safety and Pharmacokinetic Data for CPI-444 
         Prior to licensing CPI-444 from Vernalis, Vernalis and its corporate partner conducted two Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and one Phase 1b trial in patients with ADHD, with oral doses ranging from 30 mg/day to 300 mg/day. Two studies were completed in healthy human male volunteers, the first of which was a single ascending dose or multiple dose study with 41 healthy volunteers. Of these 41 subjects, 21 were dosed in both the single ascending dose and multiple dose portions of the study. The second study was a receptor occupancy study performed in six human subjects using PET 
 9

   imaging to determine receptor occupancy. The third study was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over Phase 1b trial in 28 patients with ADHD, which evaluated doses up to 200 mg/ day. The results of these studies were as follows: 
 

Â Safety and tolerability:  In studies involving healthy volunteers, there was
no pattern in the incidence, severity, or relationship of adverse events to CPI-444 dose level. The main toxicity exhibited was gastro-intestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea) due to gastric
irritation; however, these findings were also observed in the placebo group. No differences in gastric endoscopy were seen between treatment and placebo groups. No dose limiting toxicities were
observed and no subject experienced a serious adverse event considered by the investigator to be related to CPI-444. There were no treatment-associated changes seen for any routine laboratory safety
tests. A minimal and transient increase in blood pressure that may have been dose-related was observed on day one, but was not detected by day 14 of continuous daily dosing. No clinically significant
cardiac abnormalities on telemetry or electrocardiogram recordings were observed. There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination findings and there were no
treatment-emergent clinically significant findings. Based on these studies, we believe that administration of CPI-444 was not associated with any clear evidence of toxicity. 
Â Human pharmacokinetics:  CPI-444 was absorbed promptly following oral
administration (lag time of less than 0.5 hours) with maximum plasma concentrations ("Cmax") observed within four hours of dosing ("tmax"). The plasma half-life ("t1/2") of CPI-444 was
determined to be approximately 10 hours after 14 days of dosing. Preliminary data indicate that the effect of food on bioavailability of CPI-444 is negligible, indicating that the drug
can be given to fasting or fed patients. 
Â Receptor occupancy in human brain:  In a receptor occupancy study conducted
by Vernalis during its development of CPI-444 for Parkinson's disease, CPI-444 was shown to bind to brain A2A receptor in a dose-dependent manner following oral administration. CPI-444 appeared to
display a direct relationship between plasma concentration and brain A2A receptor occupancy, with 50% of the receptor occupied at a concentration of 320 ng/mL. Approximately 15% of drug crosses the
blood brain barrier in studies conducted in non-human primates. Trough level plasma concentrations greater than 960 ng/mL of CPI-444 are, therefore, calculated to lead to greater than 90% A2A receptor
occupancy in peripheral tissues. These studies indicate that at the lowest plasma levels of CPI-444 achieved following 100 mg given twice per day, there would be an expected 90% or higher occupancy of

  CPI-444 Clinical Development Plan 
         In January 2016, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 1/1b, open-label, expansion cohort design clinical trial for patients with selected advanced, incurable cancers. The trial is examining oral CPI-444 administered as both a single agent and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab). Under our clinical trial collaboration agreement with Genentech, we are responsible for the design, conduct and cost of the relevant studies, which are under the review of a joint development committee made up of 
 10

   our representatives and representatives of Genentech. Genentech supplies Tecentriq (atezolizumab). Pre-treatment and on-treatment tissue, blood and serum samples are collected and tested for a wide range of biomarkers including the characteristics of immune cell infiltrates and expression of numerous genes in tumor tissue samples. 
         We are currently conducting the trial in approximately 36 sites in the United States, Australia and Canada. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer, malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer or colorectal cancer with high mutation rates are eligible for participation. Studies by others, utilizing anti-CTLA-4 therapies, anti-PD-1 therapies and anti-PD-L1 therapies have shown that these tumors are more likely to possess immunogenic proteins that are capable of eliciting anti-tumor immune responses. As a result, we believe that selecting patients with these types of tumors will enhance our chances of identifying patients responsive to CPI-444 therapy. 
         The primary objectives of our clinical trial for CPI-444, as a single agent and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab), are to:
 

Â evaluate the safety and tolerability of CPI-444 in cancer patients; 
Â determine optimum dosage based on safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data; 
Â assess primary efficacy endpoints: overall response rate, duration of clinical benefit defined as complete response, partial response and
stable disease (stable disease defined as no disease progression for at least 3 months). 
Â assess secondary efficacy endpoints: include progression free survival, duration of response, and overall survival; and 
Â assess the potential role of various biomarkers to predict or monitor response to therapy. 

         We are conducting the clinical trial of CPI-444 in two steps:
 

Â Step 1ÂDose Selection: We initiated the first step of the clinical trial in January 2016. During this step, we determined the
appropriate dosing based on safety, pharmacokinetic and biomarker studies. We randomized patients into one of four cohorts, with up to twelve patients per cohort. In three of the cohorts, we tested
single agent CPI-444 at three different doses and schedules as follows: 100 mg twice per day for 14 days, 200 mg once per day for 14 days and 100 mg twice per day for 28 days.
Treatment cycles are 28 days and patients continue on therapy until disease progression and/or toxicity. In the fourth cohort, we evaluated 100 mg twice per day for 14 days and then for
28 days in combination with a fixed dose of Tecentriq (atezolizumab). In each case, patients continued the therapy until there was evidence of disease progression and/or toxicity. We completed
the first step of the clinical trial in November 2016, after enrolling 48 patients, 47 of whom received study treatment and one of whom withdrew from the study prior to receiving any therapy. The
optimum dose of CPI-444 selected for step 2 was based on safety and pharmacodynamics. 
Â Step 2ÂDose Expansion: We initiated this portion of the clinical trial in November 2016. During this step, we plan to further
evaluate the selected dose and schedule of CPI-444 as a single agent and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in disease-specific expansion cohorts. This phase of the study has ten cohorts,
with five cohorts receiving single agent CPI-444 at a dose of 100mg twice per day for 28 days and five cohorts receiving the combination of CPI-444 at a dose of 100 mg twice per day for
28 days and Tecentriq (atezolizumab). Patients are placed into disease-specific cohorts based on type of cancer and prior exposure to an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody. We expect that each
cohort will initially enroll up to 14 patients, with cohorts to be expanded if evidence of anti-tumor activity is shown. If a response (defined as partial or complete tumor response or disease
stabilization for three months or more) in one or 

 11

   

more
patients out of 14 patients in a cohort is observed, then we intend to expand that cohort by twelve additional patients to a total of 26 patients. If no response is seen in the initial 14
patients, then we expect to cease enrollment in that cohort. If a response in five or more patients out of 26 patients in the expanded cohort is observed, then we intend to expand that cohort again by
an additional 22 patients, for a total of 48 patients. We believe this design will enhance our ability to detect tumor responses in a range of tumor types. 


         The goal of the clinical trial is to determine optimal dosing and to identify the tumors that are most responsive to treatment with CPI-444 alone or in combination, which we expect to form the basis for subsequent potential pivotal trials either with CPI-444 alone or in combination. The endpoints for the trial are safety, tolerability and efficacy for CPI-444 administered as both a single agent and in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab). Numerous biomarker and immunologic analyses undertaken during the clinical trial may provide additional exploratory endpoints. Evaluation of responses will be made according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ("RECIST") criteria. RECIST is a set of published rules that define when tumors in cancer patients improve (respond), stay the same (stabilize), or worsen (progress) during treatments. The criteria were published in February 2000 by an international collaboration including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute of the United States, and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. 
         The following is a schematic of the overall study design of our Phase 1/1b clinical trial showing three CPI-444 single agent dose selection cohorts and one combination CPI-444 and Tecentriq (atezolizumab) cohort followed by disease-specific expansion cohorts that will receive single agent CPI-444 or CPI-444 combined with Tecentriq (atezolizumab). The disease cohorts include non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC"), malignant melanoma ("MEL"), renal cell cancer ("RCC"), triple-negative 
 12

   breast cancer ("TNBC") and one additional cohort ("Other"), which includes bladder cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer with high mutation rates. 
      Phase 1/lb Clinical Trial Protocol 

  CPI-444 Preliminary Clinical Trial Results 
         In November 2016, we completed enrollment in the first step, the dose selection phase, of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial. Of 47 patients enrolled and receiving study treatment, all patients had failed all approved therapies for their disease, with a median of four prior treatment regimens and a range of one to five treatment regimens. All of the patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ("ECOG") performance status of 0 or 1, meaning that the patients were fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction (ECOG status of 0) or somewhat restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work (ECOG status of 1). The majority of patients were resistant or refractory to prior therapies with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent. 
         As of November 2016, the results from the first step of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial for CPI-444 were as follows:
 

Â Of the 32 patients who reached the first efficacy assessment at two months, 12 had stable disease and 20 had shown disease progression.
Fourteen patients did not reach their two-month assessment. Six of the patients with disease progression remained on treatment based on investigator judgment that there was clinical benefit. 
Â Of the 12 patients with stable disease, several showed ongoing tumor regression (1-20% reduction of the volume of tumor lesions) by
computerized tomography ("CT") scan, but had 

 13

   

not
yet reached the criteria for partial response (greater than 30% percent reduction in tumor size compared to baseline CT scan per RECIST criteria). Seven of the 12 patients with stable disease
received CPI-444 as a single agent. 


Â Of the 10 patients with NSCLC, seven received single agent CPI-444. Five of seven evaluable patients had stable disease at two or more months
(three of whom received single agent therapy). Nine patients remained on treatment and one patient discontinued treatment. 
Â Of the five patients with renal cancer, four received single agent CPI-444. Four patients remained on treatment and three of four evaluable
patients had stable disease. 
Â Two of four evaluable patients with bladder cancer showed stable disease at first assessment, both of whom received single agent CPI-444. 
Â Of the ten patients with TNBC, one of seven evaluable patients showed stable disease. Eight patients remained on treatment. 
Â One of five evaluable patients with melanoma had stable disease with regression of cutaneous tumor lesions. The patient who exhibited stable
disease received single agent CPI-444. 
Â One of two evaluable patients with prostate cancer treated with combination therapy had stable disease and showed a decrease in
prostate-specific antigen ("PSA") at 29 weeks. The patient who exhibited stable disease gained weight and required significantly less narcotics for pain management. 

         As of January 2017, 33 patients had reached their initial three month efficacy assessment. Among such patients, there were no complete responses, two partial responses and 12 patients with stable disease. Of the partial responses, one was observed in a patient with renal cell cancer and one was observed in a patient with malignant melanoma; both of these patients received single agent CPI-444 and had been refractory to prior therapy with [an anti-PD-1 antibody]. Tumor regression has been observed in liver, lung and lymph node sites of disease. 
         On January 10, 2017, we announced that the protocol-predefined criteria for expansion was reached for the cohort of patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with single-agent CPI-444. Accordingly, the size of that cohort has been increased from 14 to 26 patients. Of the initial four patients with renal cell cancer treated with single agent CPI-444 (in either the dose-selection or disease-specific cohorts), one patient, who was refractory to prior treatment with [an anti-PD-1 antibody], achieved a partial response (as noted above), two patients had stable disease, and one patient showed tumor progression. A fifth patient (in the dose-selection cohort), who was refractory to prior treatment with an anti-PD-1 antibody, received CPI-444 in combination with Tecentriq (atezolizumab), and had stable disease. In the renal cell cancer patient where a partial response was achieved, tumor regression of metastases in the left and right lobe of the patient's liver was seen in the CT scan taken after three months of treatment. A biopsy of the regressing liver lesion performed at three months was compared to a pre-treatment specimen and showed absence of detectable tumor cells and dense infiltration with lymphocytes, consistent with a robust anti-tumor immune response. 
         We believe these preliminary data indicate that CPI-444 has single agent activity in multiple tumor histologies and in patients refractory to prior therapies with anti-PD-1/PDL-L antibodies. 
   CPI-444 Clinical Safety Data 
         CPI-444 has been well tolerated to date, with grade three or higher serious adverse events seen only in patients treated with CPI-444 and Tecentriq (atezolizumab) in combination. In particular, one patient in the combination cohort of the first step of the clinical trial experienced Grade 3 autoimmune hemolytic anemia and a different patient in the combination cohort of the second step of the clinical trial experienced Grade 4 aseptic meningoencephalitis thought to be an immune related toxicity. Both 
 14

   of these patient's adverse events resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. Other observed toxicities were mild and are commonly seen in patients with advanced cancers, such as nausea (15%), fatigue (21%), constipation (21%) and vomiting (18%). 
   CPI-444 Dose Selection and Biomarkers 
         As part of our pharmacodynamic analysis, we evaluated occupancy of the A2A receptor by CPI-444, and its ability to block adenosine receptor mediated signaling. Whole blood was collected on day 1 pre-treatment and on day 14 at pre-dose and post-dose at 1.5 hr, 3 hr, 5.5 hr and 8 hr. Blood was activated with an adenosine analog ("NECA") and subsequently tested for intracellular phospho-CREB ("pCREB") signaling in lymphocytes by flow cytometry. 
         Seven of seven patients receiving CPI-444 100 mg twice daily had sustained, complete blockade of peripheral blood lymphocyte A2A receptors. Further, plasma levels of CPI-444 of 2 mcg/ml resulted in complete saturation of A2A receptors in peripheral blood lymphocytes. These results were in line with our expectation that such plasma concentrations of CPI-444 would lead to greater than 90% A2A receptor occupancy in peripheral tissues, thereby blocking adenosine receptor mediated signaling. In addition, treatment-related increases in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that were both PD-1-positive and CD8-positive (double positive) provided evidence of immune activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Previous research from others has shown that PD-1, CD8 double positive T-cells are associated with anti-tumor immune responses. In 14 patients tested to date, increases in PD-1, CD8 double positive T-cells were observed in seven of seven patients receiving single agent CPI-444 100 mg twice daily, in one of three patients receiving single agent CPI-444 200 mg once daily, and in three of four patients receiving CPI-444 50 mg twice daily combined with Tecentriq (atezolizumab). Based on these and other data, we selected an oral dose of 100 mg twice daily for 28 days for both the single agent and combination arms of the second part (Step Two) of the trial. 
   Product Candidate: A monoclonal anti-CD73 antibody for cancer 
   Overview 
         In December 2014, we in-licensed from Scripps a mouse anti-human CD73 antibody, CPX-006. We have genetically engineered CPX-006 to be humanized by replacing the immunoglobulin ("Ig") heavy and light chain constant regions, and by replacing the murine variable framework regions with human heavy and light chain Ig frameworks. In addition, we have further engineered CPX-006 to enhance binding to CD73 and to block its catalytic activity, which we expect will inhibit conversion of AMP to adenosine by tumor cells. 
   The Role of CD73 in Cancer 
         CD73 is an enzyme expressed on lymphocytes and tumor cells that regulates immune responses by producing immunosuppressive adenosine. The catalytic production of adenosine by CD73 may play an important role in tumor immune suppression by increasing the concentration of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment. CD73 is overexpressed in many cancers, and high levels of CD73 have been shown to be associated with poor prognosis. CD73 expression on tumor cells as well as on the host immune cells has been shown to promote tumor immune suppression and metastasis in mice. Other studies in mice have shown that the targeted blockade of CD73 with antibodies can enhance the therapeutic activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade. We believe CD73 and the adenosine-cancer axis may play a role in acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies. 
   Preclinical Proof of Concept 
         In preclinical studies using tumor cells that express the CD73 enzyme, the addition of various concentrations of CPX-006 to such cells in culture substantially inhibited the catalytic activity of the 
 15

   enzyme to background levels of the assay. This was studied by measuring the conversion of AMP to adenosine. These studies demonstrated that at concentrations of 10 Âµg/ml, CPX-006 was capable of substantially inhibiting the production of adenosine, which indicates that CPX-006 binds to a critical site in the CD73 enzyme necessary for its function. By blocking the cellular production of adenosine, we believe CPX-006 could lead to enhancement of the anti-tumor immune response by lowering the amount of adenosine in the tumor environment. Other preclinical studies we conducted have shown that CPX-006 binds to a variety of different types of cancer cell lines in vitro, including those derived from human breast cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemias and sarcomas. 
   Anti-CD73 Development Plan 
         We are conducting IND-enabling studies for the development of CPX-006 in potential clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and plan to complete these studies in late 2017. In particular, we intend to conduct additional preclinical studies in non-human primates to determine optimum dose and schedule. Subject to the completion of our IND-enabling studies and the submission and acceptance by the FDA of an IND, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for CPX-006 in early 2018. 
   Product Candidate: An antagonist of the adenosine A2B receptor 
         We have in-licensed several selective and potent adenosine A2B receptor antagonists from Vernalis. In addition, we are synthesizing and have identified other A2B receptor antagonists from our internal research program. Adenosine A2B receptors have recently been found to play an important role in the immune response to tumors. Similar to adenosine A2A receptors, adenosine binds to adenosine A2B receptors, which leads to immunosuppression. However, adenosine A2B receptor expression is found on different immune cells, and its function in tumor induced immune suppression is not yet well understood. We intend to further develop our A2B agents to improve potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic behavior and immune enhancing properties. We expect to conduct studies similar to those we have conducted for CPI-444 in order to select a development candidate in 2017. Upon selection, we intend to conduct further IND-enabling studies and potential Phase 1 clinical trials. 
   ITK Inhibitor 
   ITK and Anti-tumor Immune Response 
         ITK is an enzyme expressed predominantly in T-cells where it plays a key role in T-cell signaling. T-cell signaling involving ITK is required in the development of T-cells within the thymus, where ITK regulates the production of various T-cell subsets and functions. The ITK cell signaling pathway is similar to the signaling that occurs in B-cells, which is mediated by a homologous enzyme known as BTK, the target of ibrutinib, an approved treatment for patients with B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. We believe that inhibiting ITK in malignant T-cells may be of therapeutic benefit in patients with T-cell leukemias and lymphomas, analogous to the effects of ibrutinib on B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. In malignant T-cells, ITK was found to be over-expressed specifically in certain T-cell lymphomas, including peripheral T-cell lymphoma ("PTCL"), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ("AITL") and in a subgroup of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma ("T-ALL"). 
         In ITK genetic knockout mice, which completely lack expression of ITK, T-cells exhibit defects in T helper cell differentiation and cytokine secretion but retain the ability to differentiate into cytotoxic T-cells that secrete IL-2 and IFNg, which are the cells responsible for tumor rejection. We believe that skewing T helper cell differentiation to favor cytotoxic T-cells may be beneficial in treating cancer. T-cells also express a redundant enzyme called resting lymphocyte kinase ("RLK"). RLK can signal in place of ITK in killer T-cells. It is believed that blocking ITK selectively, without affecting RLK, results in production of anti-tumor cytotoxic T-cells necessary for tumor rejection, as occurs in ITK genetic knockout mice. 
 16

          
  Product Candidate: An ITK kinase inhibitor 
         We have identified ITK as a product candidate target because it plays a key role in T-cell receptor signaling and in the differentiation of T-cells responsible for tumor immunity. Small molecule inhibitors of ITK, such as ibrutinib, have been shown to shift the balance in signaling to enhance anti-tumor immune responses in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. While this observation provides important target validation, ibrutinib is primarily a BTK inhibitor and lacks the necessary potency and selectivity for ITK, which is believed to limit the clinical use of ibrutinib as an ITK inhibitor in this setting. As a result, we believe an inhibitor specifically targeting ITK could enhance anti-tumor immune response. 
         We are currently developing selective small molecule covalent inhibitors of ITK by targeting the cysteine amino acid residue at position 442 in the ITK protein. Covalent targeting of ITK is expected to provide a selective and prolonged duration of activity without the need for high systemic exposures and thereby improve the therapeutic window. This approach was previously used by our co-founders to generate ibrutinib. We have synthesized several ITK inhibitors that are selective for ITK and do not react appreciably with RLK. It is anticipated that this selectivity will mimic the immune properties seen in ITK knockout mice and skew the immune response toward a more favorable anti-tumor immune response. In 2016, we selected a lead development candidate under this program and are currently conducting IND-enabling studies. Subject to the completion of such studies and the submission and acceptance by the FDA of an IND, we plan to advance the candidate into clinical trials in patients with cancers, including patients with T-cell lymphoma and other cancers, such as solid tumors, in 2018. 
   Manufacturing 
         We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical testing, as well as for manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. We are able to internally produce small quantities of our product candidates required for relatively short preclinical animal studies. We believe that this allows us to accelerate the drug development process by not having to rely on third parties for all of our research and development needs. However, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a number of contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in more lengthy preclinical development and clinical trials and in relation to any future commercialization of our product candidates. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products. This strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure, avoid depending on our own manufacturing facility and equipment while simultaneously enabling us to focus our expertise on developing our products. Although we believe we have multiple potential sources for the manufacturing of our product candidates, we currently rely on single manufacturers for different components of CPI-444 and our anti-CD73 antibody. 
 Competition 
         The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by intense competition and rely heavily on the ability to move quickly, adapt to changing medical and market needs, and to develop and maintain strong intellectual property positions. We believe that the development experience of our scientific and management team, as well as the strength and promise of our product candidates, provide us with a competitive advantage; nevertheless, we face potential competition from myriad sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 
         We are aware of companies that have advanced adenosine A2A receptor antagonists into early- or late-stage clinical development for non-oncology indications, primarily Parkinson's disease. These 
 17

   companies include Merck & Co., Inc. and Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (through its acquisition of Biotie Therapies Corp. in 2016). In addition, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma, Inc. has approval in Japan for an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist for use in Parkinson's disease and is currently conducting a Phase 3 study in the United States for Parkinson's disease. Within oncology, Palobiofarma SL has submitted an IND to begin a Phase 1 dose finding clinical trial with an adenosine A2A antagonist in lung cancer patients. Novartis has announced an exclusive licensing agreement with Palobiofarma. AstraZeneca plc has licensed a preclinical A2A antagonist for use in cancer therapy from Heptares, Inc. Merck KgaA has entered into a pre-clinical collaboration with Domain Therapeutics Inc. to develop programs targeting the adenosine pathway. In addition, Redoxtherapies, Inc., which was acquired by Juno Therapeutics, is developing an A2A receptor antagonist for cancer. More generally, in the field of immuno-oncology, there are large pharmaceutical companies with approved products or products in late-stage development that target other immune checkpoints, including PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4. These companies include Bristol-Myers Squibb (nivolumab, ipilimumab), Merck (pembrolizumab), Genentech (atezolizumab) and AstraZeneca (durvalumab, tremelimumab). Also, AstraZeneca and MedImmune LLC have recently announced the initiation of a Phase 1 study with an anti-CD73 antibody. Bristol-Myers Squibb also announced the development of an anti-CD73 antibody. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and AbbVie Inc. are co-marketing Imbruvica (ibrutinib), which is a small molecule inhibitor of the kinase BTK that has also been reported to inhibit ITK. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from our collaborators or other third parties. We do not yet own any issued patents relating to our product candidates. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States covering our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of immuno-oncology. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to obtain and maintain licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
         We have in-licensed patents and patent applications directed to certain of our product candidates and related uses thereof. We also possess and in-license substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. As of December 31, 2016, our owned and licensed patent portfolio consisted of eight licensed U.S. issued patents, two licensed U.S. pending patent applications and six owned U.S. provisional patent applications directed to CPI-444 or certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements or other potential product candidates. In addition, our licensed patent portfolio included 16 licensed patents issued in jurisdictions outside of the United States and five licensed patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States that are foreign counterparts to one or more of the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States in our portfolio are held primarily in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and China. 
 18

           With respect to the immuno-oncology product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. 
         Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued United States patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The issued United States patents we license from Vernalis directed to the composition of matter of CPI-444 and its method of use for treating disorders treatable by purine receptor blocking are expected to expire between January 2022 and July 2029, excluding any patent term extension that may be available. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
         The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immuno-oncology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we license, and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even the issued patents that we license do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and the issued patents that we in-license and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire 
 19

   or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
   Licenses and Collaborations 
   Vernalis Licensing Agreement 
         In February 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Vernalis, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights and know-how, including a limited right to grant sublicenses, for all fields of use to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing certain adenosine receptor antagonists, including CPI-444. The issued U.S. patents that we in-licensed from Vernalis pursuant to this agreement are directed to the composition of matter of CPI-444 and its method of use for treating disorders treatable by purine receptor blocking. These patents are expected to expire in the United States between January 2022 and July 2029, excluding any patent term extension that may be available. Vernalis has the first right to prosecute and maintain the licensed patent rights worldwide, subject to our right with respect to certain of the licensed patents to continue prosecution and maintenance if Vernalis elects not to do so. We also have the right to prosecute and maintain any patent rights that we may own that cover the licensed compounds that do not fall within the licensed patent rights. Pursuant to this agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct certain activities to obtain marketing authorizations for licensed products and to conduct certain preclinical and clinical studies for CPI-444. We also must use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct certain preclinical and clinical studies to support the use of CPI-444 as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer studies, and to meet certain specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones within specified time periods. 
         Pursuant to this agreement, we made a one-time cash payment to Vernalis in the amount of $1.0 million upon entering into the agreement. We are also required to make cash milestone payments to Vernalis upon the successful completion of clinical and regulatory milestones for licensed products depending on the indications for which such licensed products are developed and upon achievement of certain sales milestones. On February 13, 2017, we made a milestone payment of $3 million to Vernalis following the expansion of a cohort of patients with renal cell cancer treated with single-agent CPI-444 in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial. The aggregate potential milestone payments are approximately $220 million for all indications. 
         We have also agreed to pay Vernalis tiered incremental royalties based on the annual net sales of licensed products containing CPI-444 on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, subject to certain offsets and reductions. The tiered royalty rates for products containing CPI-444 range from the mid-single digits up to the low-double digits on a country-by-country net sales basis. The royalties on other licensed products that do not include CPI-444 also increase with the amount of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and range from the low-single digits up to the mid-single digits on a country-by-country net sales basis. 
         The agreement will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of our payment obligations to Vernalis in respect of a particular product and country. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. We may also terminate the agreement at our convenience by providing 90 days written notice, provided that we have not received notice of our own default under the agreement at the time we exercise such termination right. Vernalis may also terminate the agreement if we challenge a licensed patent or undergo a bankruptcy event. 
   Scripps Licensing Agreement 
         In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Scripps, pursuant to which we were granted a non-exclusive, world-wide license for all fields of use under Scripps' rights in certain 
 20

   know-how and technology related to a mouse hybridoma clone expressing an anti-human CD73 antibody, and to progeny, mutants or unmodified derivatives of such hybridoma and any antibodies expressed by such hybridoma. Scripps also granted us the right to grant sublicenses in conjunction with other proprietary rights we hold, or to others collaborating with or performing services for us. Under this license agreement, Scripps has agreed not to grant any additional commercial licenses with respect to such materials, other than march-in rights granted to the U.S. government. 
         Upon execution of the agreement, we made a one-time cash payment to Scripps of $10,000 and are also obligated to pay a minimum annual fee to Scripps of $25,000. The first minimum annual fee payment is due on the first anniversary of effective date of the agreement and will be due on each subsequent anniversary of the effective date for the term of the agreement. We are also required to make performance-based cash payments upon successful completion of clinical and sales milestones. The aggregate potential milestone payments are $2.6 million. We are also required to pay royalties on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees at a rate in the low-single digits. In addition, should we sublicense the rights licensed under the agreement, we have agreed to pay a percentage of sublicense revenue received at specified rates that start at double digit percentages and decrease to single digit percentages based on the elapsed time from the effective date of the agreement and the time of entry into such sublicense. 
         Our license agreement with Scripps will terminate upon expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to Scripps under the license agreement. The license agreement is terminable by the consent of the parties, at will by us or upon providing 90 days written notice to Scripps, or by Scripps for certain material breaches by us, or if we undergo a bankruptcy event. In addition, Scripps may terminate our license on a product-by-product basis, or the entire agreement, if we fail to meet specified diligence obligations related to the development and commercialization of licensed products. Scripps may also terminate the agreement after the third anniversary of the effective date of the agreement if it reasonably believes, based on reports we provide to Scripps, that we have not used commercially reasonable efforts as required under the agreement, subject to a specified notice and cure period. 
   Genentech Collaboration Agreement 
         In October 2015, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Genentech to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CPI-444 combined with Genentech's investigational cancer immunotherapy, Tecentriq (atezolizumab), a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, in a variety of solid tumors in our Phase 1/1b clinical trial. Pursuant to this agreement, we will be responsible for the conduct and cost of the relevant studies, under the supervision of a joint development committee made up of our representatives and representatives of Genentech. Genentech will supply Tecentriq (atezolizumab). As part of the agreement, we granted Genentech certain rights of first negotiation to participate in future clinical trials that we may conduct evaluating the administration of CPI-444 in combination with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody. If we do not reach agreement on the terms of any such participation by Genentech within a specified time period, we retain the right to collaborate with third parties in such activities. We also granted Genentech certain rights of first negotiation should we decide to license development and commercialization rights to CPI-444. Should we not reach agreement on the terms of such a license within a specified time period, we retain the right to enter into a license with another third party. 
         We and Genentech each have the right to terminate the agreement for material breach by the other party. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by either party due to safety considerations, if directed by a regulatory authority or if development of CPI-444 or Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is discontinued. Further, the agreement will expire after a set period of time following the provision by us of the final clinical study report to Genentech.

     Regulation 
         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the BLA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 United States Drug Development Process 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA"), and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
         The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

Â completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with GLP regulations and other applicable
regulations; 
Â submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
Â performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice ("GCP") regulations to establish
the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
Â submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
Â satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance
with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
Â FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. 

         Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety 
 22

   concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board ("IRB") at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
         Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

Â Phase 1:  The product
candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or
life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in
patients. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1 trials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing, pharmacokinetics and safety
in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate biomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific types of diseases. 
Â Phase 2:  This phase
involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and
to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. 
Â Phase 3:  Clinical trials
are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to
establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. 

         Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. 
         The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
         During the development of a new drug or biologic, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of 
 23

   development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug or biologic. 
         Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
         There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. 
         Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
   United States Review and Approval Process 
         The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
         The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
         Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and 
 24

   purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. 
         After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug's safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
         The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA"), which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
   Orphan Drug Designation 
         Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biologic product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales 
 25

   of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
         If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug or biologic also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biologic as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in that jurisdiction. 
         Although we have not sought or obtained orphan designation for any of our product candidates, we may pursue such designation in the future if we determine that our proposed indications meet the qualifying criteria for such designation. 
   Expedited Development and Review Programs 
         The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. 
         Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of original BLAs and new molecular entity NDAs under its standard review goals. 
         In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug and biologic products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is 
 26

   reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
         FDASIA established a new category of drugs and biologics referred to as "breakthrough therapies" that may be eligible to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug or biologic candidate as a "breakthrough therapy" if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request. 
   Post-approval requirements 
         Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug and biologics manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. 
         Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market and imposes requirements and restrictions on drug and biologics manufacturers, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or 
 27

   manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 
   Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
         Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates, some of the U.S. patents that we may be granted in the future may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, less any time the applicant did not act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for patents that may be issued to us, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant marketing application. 
         Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") or a NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
         Pediatric exclusivity is a type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ("BPCA") provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written 
 28

   request from the FDA. If such written request does not include clinical trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those clinical trials. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate written requests. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. 
   Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
         The Affordable Care Act includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only four biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
         Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being addressed by the FDA. 
         Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until twelve years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this twelve-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed "interchangeable" by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
         The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the twelve-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
   Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
         In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. 
 29

          
        Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidates, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product candidates in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization ("CTA") must be submitted to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, clinical study development may proceed. 
         The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
         To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union's regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
         The criteria for designating an "orphan medicinal product" in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
         The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the 
 30

   product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
 

Â the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
Â the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
Â the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 

         For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
         If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
   Other Healthcare Laws 
         In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with physicians, customers and third-party payors including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. Such laws include:


Â The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying,
soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the
purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual
knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting
from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 
Â The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit any person or entity from, among
other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to
be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government; 
Â The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), which prohibits, among other actions, knowingly and
willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a
healthcare benefit program, willfully 

 31

   

obstructing
a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent
statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 


Â The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain
payments and "transfers of value" provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
Â HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), and their respective implementing
regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates;
and 
Â Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and
claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

         If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
         To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
   Coverage and Reimbursement 
         Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. 
         The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement 
 32

   rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time consuming process. 
         The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. 
   Healthcare Reform 
         A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers' outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal healthcare programs, and created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
         We expect that the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration's policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the burdensome provisions of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump's administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. 
         We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several 
 33

   Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 
         In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
         We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures. 
   Research and Development Expenses 
         Our research and development expenses were $29.4 million, $11.4 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Research and Development Expenses" for additional detail regarding our research and development activities. 
 Environment 
         Our third-party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. 
 Employees 
         As of December 31, 2016, we had 44 total employees, all of whom were full-time and 35 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities. 
   Facilities 
         We currently lease a total of approximately 28,633 square feet of office and research and development facilities in Burlingame, California. Our lease expires in 2021. We regularly explore alternatives which would provide us with additional space to accommodate our anticipated growth.
