Item 1. Business
Overview
We were founded on January 19, 2018 as AppHarvest Operations, Inc. (f/k/a AppHarvest, Inc. “Legacy AppHarvest”) a Delaware public benefit corporation. Together with our subsidiaries, we are a sustainable food company in Appalachia developing and operating some of the world’s largest high-tech indoor farms with robotics and artificial intelligence to build a reliable, climate-resilient food system. Our farms are designed to grow produce using sunshine, rainwater and up to 90% less water than open-field growing, all while producing yields up to 30 times that of traditional agriculture and preventing pollution from agricultural runoff. We combine conventional agricultural techniques with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence and robotics, to improve access to nutritious food, while farming more sustainably, building a domestic food supply, and increasing investment in Appalachia.
On January 29, 2021, Legacy AppHarvest, Novus Capital Corporation (“Novus”), and ORGA, Inc., wholly-owned subsidiary of Novus (“Merger Sub”), consummated the closing of the transactions contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated September 2020 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), following the approval at a special meeting of the stockholders of Novus held on January 29, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, a business combination of Legacy AppHarvest and Novus was effected through the merger of Legacy AppHarvest with and into Merger Sub, with Legacy AppHarvest surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Novus (the “Business Combination”). On the closing date, Legacy AppHarvest changed its name to AppHarvest Operations, Inc. and Novus changed its name from Novus Capital Corporation to AppHarvest, Inc. 
We are committed to the communities where we operate by providing compelling, long-term career opportunities to the local workforce as well as partnering with educational institutions, such as the University of Kentucky and local high schools and technical schools, to create programs that benefit students, researchers, and our own operations. At AppHarvest, the goal is to lay the foundation for Appalachia to become the AgTech capital of North America.
Our commitment to Appalachia is driven by the personal connection of AppHarvest’s leadership, including Jonathan Webb, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, to the area. As a proud Kentucky native, Mr. Webb has developed deep relationships within the Appalachian community that include civic leaders, strategic vendors and suppliers, and local and state elected officials. Our deep connection to the local community has been instrumental in facilitating our growth and development.
We have a refined geographic strategy in place designed to impart immediate as well as long-term benefits. Central Appalachia presents multiple strategic advantages for us, including beneficial climate patterns that allow all, or substantially all, of our water requirements to be supplied naturally by rainfall, and geographic proximity to approximately 70% of all U.S. households within a one-day drive.
We are a mission-driven organization with an ethos rooted in sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) principles. Our leadership team and employees share a deeply-held belief that, as an organization, we are responsible to multiple stakeholders, including our workers, community, customers, environment, and stockholders. We are a public benefit corporation, which underscores the commitment to our mission and stakeholders. In addition, we elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we were designated as a Certified B Corporation in December 2019.
Prior to October 2020, our operations were limited to the “start-up” concerns of organizing and staffing, business planning, raising capital, and acquiring and developing properties for CEA. In October 2020, we partially opened our first CEA facility in Morehead, Kentucky (“AppHarvest Morehead”). We harvested our first crop of beefsteak tomatoes and tomatoes on the vine in January 2021 and March 2021, respectively. In May 2021, we opened production of the full 60 acres at AppHarvest Morehead, and in November 2022 began harvesting snacking tomatoes. 
Subsequent to the construction of AppHarvest Morehead, we started construction on four more CEA facilities. The facility located in Berea, Kentucky (“AppHarvest Berea”) became operational in October 2022, and the facility located in Somerset, Kentucky (“AppHarvest Somerset”) became operational in November 2022. AppHarvest Berea harvests salad greens and AppHarvest Somerset primarily grows strawberries but is also expected to seasonally grow cucumbers. In December 2022, we 
entered into an agreement to sell AppHarvest Berea to an affiliate of our distribution partner Mastronardi Produce Limited (“Mastronardi”) as further discussed below. The CEA facility in Richmond, Kentucky (“ AppHarvest Richmond”), which is still under construction, was half planted in December 2022, and began commercial shipments in January 2023. 
We commenced construction of a second Morehead, Kentucky facility (“AppHarvest Morehead North”), which is adjacent to AppHarvest Morehead, in June 2021, which is intended to grow salad greens. We have indefinitely paused the development of the 10-acre Morehead salad greens facility, with resumption of construction contingent upon financing.
Agriculture’s Current Challenges and Our Opportunity

Today’s agriculture challenges are wide-reaching and accelerating. The World Bank forecasts that global food production will need to increase by approximately 70% or more by 2050 to feed the growing global population. Inclusive of vine crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) predicts that the total annual value of domestic fruit, vegetable, and nut production will exceed $66 billion by 2029, a $14 billion annual increase over the 2020 annual value. In 2020, vegetable production accounted for approximately 41% of total farm value (or approximately $21.5 billion), with fresh use vegetables comprising approximately 32% of the market (or approximately $6.9 billion). Tomatoes are the second most popular fresh market produce in the United States. Per capita consumption1 of fresh tomatoes has grown to approximately 19 pounds per year in 2020, approximately 51% higher than it was nearly four decades ago. The USDA attributes this growth primarily to changing consumer preferences and a shift towards a healthier diet and overall lifestyle.
Domestically, the increasing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables has necessitated significant imports of produce into the United States. The majority of America’s supply of fresh tomatoes and other vine crops, including cucumbers, bell peppers, and eggplants, are imported. In 2021, 68% of fresh tomatoes for sale in the United States were imported, up from 50% in 2011. 
Meanwhile, 76% of bell peppers and 87% of cucumbers were imported in 2021, up from 51% and 66%, respectively, in 2011. Over approximately the last three decades, the United States’ reliance on imports has more than doubled. The country’s single largest import partner is Mexico, which comprises 77% of U.S. fresh vegetable imports in 2020.
Percentage of Crops Imported:
A continued reliance on imports puts the U.S. food supply at risk from both natural and politically destabilizing events. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this risk. During the pandemic, the supply chain has been disrupted and food imports have been, at times, delayed or even cancelled.
A reduced or delayed supply of produce can have a pronounced impact on grocers, which generally operate on thin financial margins and just-in-time inventory practices. A consistent and reliable supply chain is vital to the grocery retail industry, which attempts to match closely the perishable supply of produce to near-term customer demand. We believe that CEA, which provides more reliable, sustainable, and higher quality produce, produced in accordance with much higher food safety standards, is an optimal solution for the grocery industry’s reliance on imports, and that there will be a strong preference among distributors and grocers to shift from imports to CEA as more supply becomes available from CEA.
Demand for sustainable farming and new CEA infrastructure has been amplified by the effects of climate change and other environmental factors. Historically, California and Mexico have produced a majority of the fresh produce sold to consumers in the United States. Unsustainable farming practices, structural changes in water resources, and an over-reliance on chemicals,

which can be harmful to people in a variety of ways, have degraded large swaths of arable land. Globally, approximately one-third of arable land is estimated to be at least partially degraded. This could increase to more than 90% of arable land unless there is a significant shift in farming practices and infrastructure.
In addition, shifting weather patterns believed to be the result of climate change are accelerating the threat to existing agricultural regions. Reduced rainfall and increasingly hot conditions in certain growing regions are increasing the demand for, and consumption of, irrigation water. Two-thirds of Mexico is arid or semi-arid, with annual rainfalls of less than 500 millimeters. California’s Public Policy Institute estimates that 500,000 to 780,000 acres would need to lie fallow for the state’s natural aquifers to re-balance.
Our facilities are well positioned to take advantage of Kentucky’s relatively high precipitation levels by capturing rainfall in large on-site retention ponds to help meet our ongoing irrigation needs.
We believe that CEA is the global solution to address the rising demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, to offset the declining availability of high-quality farmland, and to mitigate the effect of climate change on agriculture. By using leading-edge technology, we expect, at full production capacity, to be able to grow up to 30 times more produce on a single indoor acre compared to a single, traditionally farmed outdoor acre.
This belief is based on third-party research and publications stating that produce grown in CEA facilities can yield anywhere from 20 to 50 times as much as traditional farming on the same amount of land. CEA allows for systematic measurements and tailoring of important variables on a per-crop level, such as nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, and irrigation. CEA generally benefits from potential year-round optimal farming conditions, whereas open field farming and traditional greenhouses have more limited growing seasons.
We also believe that we are positioned to become a global leader in the CEA industry. We are one of only a handful of publicly traded companies focused on CEA-enabled food production in the United States. Our CEA facilities in Appalachia are designed to maximize the sustainability and efficiency of our operations. For example, our ability to farm using captured rainwater not only decreases our impact on the environment, but helps to offset the high cost of water. Captured rainwater also allows us to avoid harmful agricultural runoff, a major source of U.S. waterways pollution. Our geographic proximity to the markets we serve reduces the fuel needed to transport our fruits and vegetables to customers, thereby reducing the environmental impact of distributing our products. Relative to growers in California and Mexico, we estimate we can distribute our products using up to 80% less fuel and with an extended shelf life and less spoilage due to a shorter time spent in transit.
Strengths
Industry Leading Position with an Early Mover Advantage
AppHarvest Morehead, combined with AppHarvest Richmond, AppHarvest Somerset, and AppHarvest Berea that we lease, position us among the largest CEA growers in the United States. Our current production acreage is growing beefsteak tomatoes, tomatoes on the vine, snacking tomatoes, salad greens and strawberries. We are also employing a “go-to-market” strategy through our partnership with Mastronardi Produce Limited, which we believe will enable us to build customer awareness and brand loyalty for future fruits, vegetables, and other value-added products.
Skilled Integrator of Proven Technologies
Our development and technology teams are highly skilled in applied agricultural technology. In many instances, the right technology to maximize crop yields sustainably already exists in the marketplace. The Netherlands, for example, has long relied on high-tech CEA facilities for domestic fruit and vegetable production and is the world’s second-largest agricultural exporter despite a land mass roughly one-third the size of Kentucky. To this end, we are working directly with companies that have been successful in the Netherlands, as well as construction firms with experience building these types of structures.
Strategic Partnerships with Important Industry Participants
To aid us in accomplishing our objectives, we have pursued partnerships with select third parties to allow us to focus our capital and resources in areas that maximize value for our Company and our shareholders.
Mastronardi
Mastronardi is our exclusive marketing and distribution partner for all fresh fruits and vegetables grown in Kentucky and West Virginia, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, berries, and/or all salad greens that meet certain quality standards. Mastronardi is a leading marketer and distributor in North America of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, berries, and salad greens. Mastronardi has an extensive and long-established retail network and is nationally recognized under the primary SUNSET® brand and other brands, including Campari®, Angel Sweet®, Flavor Bombs®, Sugar Bombs® tomatoes, Queen of Greens® washed-and-ready-to-eat salad packs and WOW™ berries. Through our partnership, we receive immediate access to a large and coveted customer base. Our produce is currently available for sale in the produce aisles of some grocers.
Pursuant to our agreement with Mastronardi (the “Mastronardi Agreement”), Mastronardi is the sole and exclusive marketer and distributor of all tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, berries and salad greens produced at our CEA facilities that meet certain quality standards (collectively, the “Products”). Under the terms of the Mastronardi Agreement, we are responsible for growing, producing, packing and delivering all products to Mastronardi, and Mastronardi is responsible for marketing, branding, and distributing our products to its customers.
Mastronardi has agreed to sell our products at market prices consistent with the best and highest prices available throughout the applicable growing season for similar USDA Grade No. 1 products. Mastronardi will set the market price for the products and will pay AppHarvest the gross sale price of the products it sells, less a marketing fee and its costs incurred in the sale and distribution of the products. If Mastronardi rejects, returns, or otherwise refuses products for failure to meet certain quality standards, we have the right, at our cost and expense, to sell or otherwise dispose of the products, subject to certain conditions. We have developed options for generating revenue from any such products, including by selling them to secondary distribution outlets.
Under the Mastronardi Agreement, if we expand the growing acreage or operations of any of our existing facilities in Kentucky or West Virginia, Mastronardi has a right of first refusal to be the exclusive distributor of any produce arising as a result of such expansion for the greater of ten years from the date of first commercial production of the additional products or the remainder of the term of the Mastronardi Agreement. Any additional sale transactions with Mastronardi would be at market price, less the marketing fee and costs incurred in the sale and distribution of the relevant products. If Mastronardi declines to exercise its right of first refusal, we have the right to contract with unaffiliated third parties that are industry recognized bona fide marketers for distribution of such produce. We have agreed not to compete with Mastronardi outside of Kentucky and West Virginia, including by growing fresh produce in a new facility outside of Kentucky and West Virginia. The non-compete provision runs for ten years from the date of the first commercial harvest from AppHarvest Morehead, which occurred in January 2021, and also runs for ten years measured from the date of a first commercial harvest from any facility deemed to be a New Grower Facility by Mastronardi under the terms of the Mastronardi Agreement. In the event we or our affiliates operate a new facility in Kentucky or West Virginia, Mastronardi has the right to deem such “New Grower Facility” to be under an agreement with Mastronardi on the same material terms and conditions of the Mastronardi Agreement for a period of ten years. In December 2020, Mastronardi elected to deem our new facilities in Richmond and Berea as New Grower Facilities. We have also agreed not to solicit any employee of Mastronardi or its affiliates without Mastronardi’s written consent during the term of each applicable Mastronardi purchase and marketing agreement, and for a period thereafter.
The initial term of the Mastronardi Agreement is ten years, beginning on the date of the commercial harvest of our first crop, which was in January 2021. After the initial term, the Mastronardi Agreement renews automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated by either party by written notice not later than 240 calendar days prior to the end of the applicable term. Either AppHarvest or Mastronardi can terminate the Mastronardi Agreement if the other party is subject to certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or if the other party is in breach of the Mastronardi Agreement and the breach remains uncured for a specified period. Our obligation to deliver timely products to Mastronardi and to maintain exclusivity is not subject to cure.
On December 23, 2022, our wholly-owned subsidiary AppHarvest Berea Farm, LLC entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Mastronardi Berea LLC, (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell approximately 40 acres of land located in Berea, Kentucky and AppHarvest Berea located thereon to the Buyer and we agreed to leaseback the property from Buyer (the “Sale-Leaseback Transaction”). The Buyer is a joint venture between Mastronardi and COFRA Holding. The Sale-Leaseback Transaction closed on December 27, 2022. 
Concurrently with the closing of the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, we as tenant, and Buyer, as landlord, entered into a lease agreement (the “Berea Lease”) for an initial term of 10 years, with four renewal options of five years each, subject to the conditions set forth in the Berea Lease. The total annual rent under the Berea Lease is initially $9.5 million per year, subject to 
the prepaid rent paid by us at the closing of the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, and shall increase annually starting after the second lease year in accordance with the terms of the Berea Lease. Subject to the terms of the Berea Lease, beginning in 2023, we (as tenant under the Lease) shall be entitled to a rent credit equal to 25% of the marketing fees received by Mastronardi prior to the third anniversary of the commencement of the Berea Lease, with respect to products grown or produced at AppHarvest Morehead, AppHarvest Richmond and AppHarvest Somerset pursuant to the Mastronardi Agreement, as reduced by costs incurred by Mastronardi in connection with the sale and distribution of such products. We are responsible for the payment of all operating expenses, taxes, insurance and maintenance and repair of AppHarvest Berea during the term of the Berea Lease. 
Experienced and Passionate Team
We are a mission-driven company led by highly committed and passionate professionals. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Webb, is a Kentucky native with more than a decade of experience focused on sustainable infrastructure. Prior to founding AppHarvest in 2018, Mr. Webb led a public-private partnership on behalf of the Department of Defense, developing what was then the largest solar project in the southeastern United States. At AppHarvest, Mr. Webb has used his experience in renewable infrastructure to create a CEA platform in North America.
In January 2023, we announced the appointment of Anthony Martin, who has served as a member of our board of directors since October 2022, to serve as Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Martin has served as a member of the board of directors of the Fruit and Vegetable Dispute Resolution Corporation, a non-profit, member-based dispute resolution organization in the fresh produce industry, since May 2018. Previously Mr. Martin served as Chief Financial Officer of Windset Farms, a controlled environment agriculture producer, from December 2007 to October 2019. 
We have attracted a highly experienced “grow team” to operate our high-tech indoor farms, and we have a construction management and development team with extensive experience in complex, large scale, multi-site, and global projects.
ESG Company
AppHarvest has an authentic and overarching commitment to sustainability, ESG, and social impact. Our Certified B Corporation certification recognizes our commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, community, environment, customers, and stockholders. We believe we present a unique and a compelling opportunity for the growing number of investors who share our dedication to sustainability and a broader set of ESG principles.
We have also been certified by an independent non-profit organization as meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Some examples of our achievements to date include:
•building our farms in underserved areas in Central Appalachia, such as Rowan County, where despite reduced wage expectations in this area, we have provided career opportunities with entry-level wages that are higher than average hourly wages for comparable jobs in the state;
•providing support for implementing AgTech educational programs with AgTech farm classrooms at 12 Appalachian high schools.
In addition we believe we also have an opportunity to impact how the regional power grid evolves. As we grow and need more power, we are committed to exploring how to catalyze new renewable energy sources in our market. We believe that when corporations insist upon completely renewable energy, market forces will drive suppliers to provide electrical energy with a reduced carbon footprint. 
We aim not only to transform the Appalachia region in terms of social and economic impact, but also to build a platform to transform agriculture and bring new solutions for growing threats to the agriculture sector, including water shortages, land shortages, soil depletion, surface water pollution, pesticide use, food waste, and systemic risks from climate change. Our growing process aims to reduce environmental impacts and manage the environmental risks increasingly threatening our food systems. Specifically, our CEA facilities are designed to manage these risks and reduce environmental impacts by:
•using up to 90% less water per pound harvested than conventional agriculture in a closed system that prevents pollution from excess fertilizers and chemical pesticides from entering the aquifer, local streams, and waterways;
•making efficient use of land without depleting soil and its nutrients;
•using integrated pest management that requires skilled workers, crop maintenance activities, beneficial insects (predators) and hygiene protocols in accordance with our Chemical Pesticide Policy.
•using a horizontal greenhouse structure to maximize passive solar energy.
•implementing new lighting systems that use up to 40% less energy than traditional lighting systems through integration of LEDs.
•exploring opportunities to link operations to renewable energy initiatives.
Our Strategy
We are a sustainable food company with global ambitions and a desire to become a trusted brand with broad brand awareness. We aim to leverage our ESG- and mission-driven ethos to grow and produce fruits, vegetables and value-added products that customers will actively seek out at their local grocery stores.
The key components to our strategy include:
•Sustainable CEA facilities: By insulating our food production system from seasonal and weather constraints, our CEA facilities are expected to produce up to 30 times more fruits and vegetables compared to traditional open-field agriculture, while also using up to 90% less water per pound harvested.
•Strategic location near major population centers: Given our location within one day’s drive of nearly 70% of the U.S. population, we are positioned to use significantly less fuel to transport our products, compared to fruits and vegetables shipped from the southwestern United States, especially California, and Mexico. 
•AgTech ecosystem: We led the signing of a non-binding collaboration agreement by a 17-organization coalition of universities, governments, and leading AgTech companies in the U.S. and abroad, which increased to a 26-organization coalition in February 2022. The collaboration agreement is intended to identify opportunities to leverage each other’s expertise and find opportunities to work together to support large-scale development in Central Appalachia. AppHarvest believes this coalition will partially reduce our research & development costs and enable us to source and identify new advancements, technologies, and opportunities more quickly than we necessarily would on our own. 
•Technology: Sourcing, developing, and implementing applied technology will be a key differentiator for AppHarvest over the long term. We are working with leading technology companies in the agriculture industry.
•Strong and available local labor force: We are committed to paying a living wage which is generally higher than the average wage for comparable work in Kentucky. As a result, we believe we can recruit and develop a competitive workforce.
Our CEA Facilities 
We operate four controlled environment agriculture facilities which include the following suite of cutting-edge technology:
•Hybrid lighting system: Our lighting system features a combination of natural sunlight, Signify GreenPower LEDs, and high-pressure sodium lighting.
•Water independence: Our CEA facilities are designed to be water-independent using rainwater collected in on-site retention ponds. This closed-loop system enables us to use up to 90% less water per pound harvested compared to open field agriculture.
•Advanced closed-loop irrigation system: Our closed-loop irrigation system incorporates nano-bubble technology to combat harmful algae blooms and cyanotoxins, as well as sand filters and high-density ultraviolet lighting (Ultraviolet lighting is designed to kill bacteria).
•Climate and CEA operations software: Our climate and high-tech indoor farm operations software allows our growers to monitor carefully microclimates inside our CEA facility and to calculate the precise levels of light, water, 
and carbon dioxide each plant needs to thrive. This operations software also allows for precise dosing of nutrients as well as temperature and humidity control.
•Integrated pest management: “IPM” is an environmentally sensitive approach to pest management, which relies in part on the use of beneficial insects to control parasites and to combat damaging pests. In addition, human scouts work to identify any pest or plant health issues early to help mitigate potential harm. 
AppHarvest Morehead 
AppHarvest Morehead, which partially opened in October 2020, is among the world’s largest indoor farms at 60 acres (approximately 2.8 million square feet) and was our first operating CEA facility. The Morehead farm currently grows beefsteak tomatoes, tomatoes on the vine, and snacking tomatoes. 
AppHarvest Berea
AppHarvest Berea, which became operational in October 2022, is 15-acres (approximately 654 thousand square feet) and features a cutting-edge touchless growing system that is automated from pre-seeding to packaging including autonomous harvesting and onsite washing to help improve both food safety and efficiency for the “Queen of Greens®” washed-and-ready-to-eat salad brand. Pursuant to the terms of the Sale-Leaseback Transaction, as of December 2022, we lease AppHarvest Berea from Mastronardi Berea LLC, a joint venture between Mastronardi Produce Limited, and COFRA Holding. 
AppHarvest Somerset 
AppHarvest Somerset began operating in November 2022, and at 30-acres, is expected initially to primarily grow strawberries, alternating seasonally with cucumbers. AppHarvest Somerset features a blast chiller that rapidly lowers the temperature of harvested strawberries prior to packaging to extend shelf life. 
AppHarvest Richmond 
AppHarvest Richmond began operating in December 2022 and at 60-acres is similar in size to AppHarvest Morehead. Half of the farm was planted in December 2022, with the second half expected to be planted in 2023. The first harvest from Richmond began in January 2023.
Competition
With vine crops imports rapidly increasing, our competition includes large-scale operations in Mexico, Canada, and, to a lesser extent, the southwestern United States. With studies having found that a U.S. meal travels 1,500 miles on average to the consumer’s plate, we believe we are unique in becoming a large-scale CEA operator growing produce closer to the end consumer.
Overall Competition
The U.S. CEA industry has grown steadily over the past decade as producers use its advantages to grow more using fewer resources, seeking to solve issues caused by limited land, energy, water and labor. The USDA attributes growth to CEA operators’ ability to realize greater market access both in the off-season and in northern retail produce markets, better product consistency and improved yields.
By 2017, the percentage of CEA-grown U.S. shipments of fresh tomatoes had grown to 5% of all shipments. Only four states (California, Minnesota, Nebraska and New York) produce more than 10 million pounds of CEA-grown tomatoes annually, according to the most recent USDA data. Kentucky’s production was estimated by the USDA to be between 500,000 pounds to 1 million pounds annually. 
High-Tech “Vertical Farming” Agricultural Startups
While most CEA production comes from traditional greenhouse companies, a number of high-tech vertical farms also exist in the market. These startups are often focused on development of small-scale farms reliant on 100% artificial lighting and municipal water either in or near major cities. These companies generally have smaller product offerings and tend to focus on salad greens products due to limitations of their technologies and economics. By contrast, we believe our facilities will have the 
ability to grow a variety of crops including salad greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries, peppers, eggplants, and more. We are also differentiated in prioritizing use of two of the earth’s natural inputs: sunlight and rainwater. In fact, our CEA facilities are some of the only facilities of their type and size in North America to rely primarily on rainwater for production. Although we supplement the light our plants receive with a hybrid LED light array, leveraging natural sunlight supports produce quality and reduces required energy per plant compared to indoor warehouse farms. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, such as FDA, the FTC, the EPA, the OSHA, and the USDA. These laws and regulations apply to the processing, packaging, distribution, sale, marketing, labeling, quality, safety, and transportation of our products, as well as our occupational safety and health practices.
Under various federal statutes and implementing regulations, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate our products and the manufacturing, labeling, marketing, promotion, and advertising thereof.
Among other things, the facilities in which our products are grown, packed or processed may be required to register with the FDA (depending on specific growing, packing, and processing operations), comply with regulatory schemes including Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption, Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food and FDA and USDA labeling and marketing requirements, as amended by the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (“FSMA”), the Organic Food Production Act, among other laws and regulations implemented by the FDA, the USDA, and other regulators. FSMA regulations are still being developed and implemented, including product traceability requirements recently proposed, which would be directly applicable to our products. The FDA and the USDA have the authority to inspect these facilities depending on the type of product and operations involved. The FDA and the USDA also require that certain nutrition and product information appear on its product labels and more generally, that its labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading. Similarly, the FTC requires that our marketing and advertising be truthful, non-misleading, not deceptive to consumers, and not otherwise an unfair means of competition. We are also restricted by FDA and USDA from making certain types of claims about our products, including nutrient content claims, health claims, organic claims, and claims regarding the effects of our products on any structure or function of the body, whether express or implied, unless we satisfy certain regulatory requirements.
We are also subject to parallel state and local food safety regulation, including registration and licensing requirements for our facilities, enforcement of standards for our products and facilities by state and local health agencies, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with selling our products.
We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our distributors and suppliers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters.
Certified B Corporation
While not required by Delaware law or the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, in December 2019, we were designated as a Certified B Corporation.
To be designated as a Certified B Corporation, companies are required to take a comprehensive and objective assessment of their positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment evaluates how a company’s operations and business model impact its workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment using a 200-point scale. While the assessment varies depending on a company’s size (number of employees), sector and location, representative indicators in the assessment include payment above a living wage, employee benefits, stakeholder engagement, supporting underserved suppliers and environmental benefits from a company’s products or services. After completing the assessment, the independent organization that certified us as a Certified B Corporation will verify our score to determine if we meet the 80- point minimum bar for certification. The review process includes a phone review, a random selection of indicators for verifying documentation and a random selection of company locations for onsite reviews, including employee interviews and facility tours. Once certified, every Certified B Corporation must make its assessment score transparent on the independent organization’s website.
Acceptance as a Certified B Corporation and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the independent organization that certified us as a Certified B Corporation. To maintain our certification, we are required to update our assessment and verify our updated score with the independent organization every three years. We received our recertification as a Certified B Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2022, based on KPIs from the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Public Benefit Corporation
In connection with our Certified B Corporation status and as a demonstration of our long-term commitment to our mission, we have been a public benefit corporation under Delaware law since inception.
Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation is required to identify in its certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits it will promote and its directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the corporation’s stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation’s certificate of incorporation. To date, there is limited case law involving public benefit corporations and the application of this and other distinct public benefit corporation requirements, which may create some uncertainty until additional case law develops.
Security holders should note, however, that Sections 361 and 365 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) indicate that Delaware’s longstanding “business judgment rule” should apply to the balancing determinations required of public benefit corporation directors so long as directors remain informed and free of conflicts of interests. Similarly, a director’s ownership of or other interest in stock of the public benefit corporation will not, for purposes of Subsection XV, create conflict of interest on the part of the director with respect to the director’s decision implicating the balancing requirement in the public benefit corporation, except to the extent that such ownership or interest would create a conflict of interest if the corporation were not a public benefit corporation. We expect that, in large part, traditional Delaware corporation law principles and the application of those principles in case law — including those related to self-dealing, conflicts of interest, and the application of the business judgment rule — will continue to apply with respect to public benefit corporations.
As provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the public benefits that we promote, and pursuant to which we manage, are empowering individuals in Appalachia, driving positive environmental change in the agriculture industry, and improving the lives of our employees and the community at large. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware are required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose to stockholders at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives. We will also consider the objectives and standards by which we will measure and report our public benefit performance in our public benefit corporation reports, including potential key performance metrics, and we have not made a final decision on such matters. We expect that we will conduct our own assessment of our benefit performance against the standards and metrics we develop, rather than having such performance conducted by a third party. We have completed a materiality assessment with an independent third party, designated our ESG metrics, and reported our first set of data in our Sustainability Report, which we released in the first half of 2022.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are valuable assets and we rely on a combination of federal, state, common law and international rights in the jurisdictions to safeguard our intellectual property. Our trademarks and other proprietary rights are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to our consumers. We believe our patents, trademarks, copyrights and domain names, and the protection of the underlying intellectual property, are important to our success. Accordingly, we own and have registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office trademarks that are important to our business, including our principal trademark, APPHARVEST, and have several additional trademark applications pending, as well.
Further, in addition to our U.S. intellectual property portfolio, we are also seeking intellectual property protection in certain other jurisdictions where available and where we deem appropriate.. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademark and copyright, as well as the use of nondisclosure, confidentiality, and intellectual property assignment agreements.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 500 full-time employees and approximately 414 independent contractors, most of whom are located in the United States. At December 31, 2022, our full-time workforce consisted of 36% female employees, and female employees represented approximately 13% of our management. Approximately 10% of our employees identified as a racial minority and racial minority employees represented 12% of our management. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. 
We have made a particular commitment to second-chance/fair-chance employment. We work with community partners who help prepare those potential candidates for employment with us. To ensure a fair shot, our interviewers are never aware interviewees are from second-chance or fair-chance programs. From top to bottom, we aim to hire a team of people as diverse as the communities in which we operate and then empower them as individuals.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards, to increase stockholder value and the success of the company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. 
We encourage employees to engage with our mission in many ways. One avenue is through “Mission Day” paid leave hours. These hours are intended to be used toward activities related to the Company’s mission, including but not limited to community volunteering and involvement. Examples include volunteering at a food bank or an animal shelter, participating in community beautification projects, or tutoring kids. Each year, employees receive up to 16 hours of paid leave designated as Mission Days depending upon their date of hire.
