Item 1. Business
 HYB Holding Corp. (the "Company") was organized under the laws of the State of Utah on October 18, 1985, with the name "Brittany Development, Inc.", which was changed to "Iron Star Development, Inc." in 2004. In March 1987 the Company sold shares of its common stock in a public offering registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on Form S-18. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $160,000 from the offering, which were invested in mineral operations in Nevada. This venture was unsuccessful, and so until 2006 the Company had no business operations.
 In 2006, the Company acquired control of Harbin Yinhai Technology Development Company Limited ("Yinhai") in a share exchange transaction. Yinhai is a corporation organized under the laws of the People's Republic of China and engaged in the business of specialty printing in China, primarily serving the banking and insurance industries. Subsequent to that acquisition, the name of the Company was changed to "Xinyinhai Technology, Ltd."

In 2013 the Company terminated its registration with the SEC pursuant to SEC Rule 12(g)(4). Subsequently, the Company exchanged its ownership interest in Yinhai for a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. Since that time, the Company has had no operations and is currently a “shell company” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). The Company is defined as a shell company because it has no operations or assets.
 In July 2019 the Company changed its name to "HYB Holding Corp," as the reference to Yinhai in its title was no longer appropriate.
 For some period of time our management has been exploring business opportunities that would involve the use of HYB Holding Corp. as a shell in a reverse merger transaction, in which an operating company would be merged into HYB Holding Corp. in exchange for shares of our capital stock. The business that we ultimately pursue will be determined by Robert Brantl, who is the sole member of our Board of Directors, or by his successor in that role. His decision will be based on the prospects for the business, the availability of capital to fund the business, and the potential benefits of the business to the shareholders of HYB Holding Corp.
 If we acquire or merge with an operating business, it is likely that our current shareholders will experience substantial dilution. In addition, there will be a change in control, as Mr. Brantl will likely sell his controlling interest in the Company.
 In March 2020 we voluntarily filed a registration statement on Form 10 to make information concerning ourselves more readily available to the public and to become eligible for listing on the OTCQB market sponsored by OTC Markets. Management believes that being a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act will enhance our efforts to acquire or merge with an operating business.
 As a result of our registration with the SEC, we will be obligated to file interim and periodic reports including an annual report with audited financial statements. This obligation will substantially increase the expenses incurred by the Company.
 Any company that is merged into or acquired by us will become subject to the same reporting requirements as apply to HYB Holding Corp. Thus, if we successfully complete an acquisition or merger, the acquired entity must have audited financial statements for at least the two most recent fiscal years, or if the acquired company has been in business for less than two years, audited financial statements must be available from its inception. This requirement limits our possible acquisitions or merger opportunities because many private companies either do not have audited financial statements or are unable to produce audited statements without long delay and substantial expense.
 Employees
 We currently have no employees. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.
