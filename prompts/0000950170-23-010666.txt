 Overview
 ZeroFox is a leading provider of SaaS-based external cybersecurity solutions. External cybersecurity focuses on exposing, disrupting, and responding to threats outside the traditional corporate perimeter. These are threats targeting organizations’ growing public attack surface as well as broader external threats.
 With digital transformation continuing to accelerate, the primary way that organizations interact and transact is now through digital channels and mediums. This has led to the proliferation of digital assets and data residing on external platforms that are outside the control of an organization. These external platforms include the surface web, deep and dark web, social media sites, collaboration platforms, code sharing sites, and mobile app stores (also referred to as "public attack service"). These external platforms are largely ungoverned, unmonitored, and unprotected by existing perimeter and internal security technologies. This public attack surface exposes organizations and their respective communities to threats to their organizations, brands, digital assets, and people. These threats include targeted phishing attacks, account takeovers, credential theft, data leakage, domain spoofing, and impersonations. The overall volume of external cyber threats targeting organizations in general continues to increase, driving a need for organizations to continuously monitor the external threat environment and incorporate threat intelligence into their security operations.
 ZeroFox provides customers with an innovative, comprehensive, SaaS-based platform for external cybersecurity (our Platform) that protects organizations from threats outside the traditional corporate perimeter. Our Platform combines protection, intelligence, adversary disruption, and response services into an integrated solution.
 Powered by patented technology and artificial intelligence innovations, our Platform collects and processes millions of pieces of content, rich media, posts, messages, global intelligence, and threat actor activity across the digital landscape, including social media sites, public, deep and dark web forums, mobile app stores, code repositories, representing thousands of digital platforms and discrete content sources. We apply advanced analytics to the data we collect and process to detect external threats to brands, people, systems, assets and data across a customer’s public attack surface. Our adversary disruption services allow organizations to disrupt and remediate these threats.
As a result of internal efforts and our August 2022 acquisition of IDX, we also offer comprehensive response services, including breach response, incident response, and intelligence and investigative services. Our data breach solutions include prevention, detection, forensic services, notification, and recovery assistance. We also offer membership subscriptions that include credit and non-credit monitoring, prevention tools, and unlimited recovery assistance.


Industry Background
 The focus of the cybersecurity industry has traditionally been protecting internal assets that are owned and controlled by the organization. Owned assets include laptops, networks, systems, and cloud workloads. With digital transformation continuing to accelerate, the primary way that companies interact and transact is now through digital channels and mediums.
 An increasingly large number of businesses, including those in industries that were slower to adopt digital technologies, have adopted social media, mobile applications, and cloud computing resulting in more critical digital assets now residing outside of traditional firewalls. These organizations now offer mobile and web applications as a key driver of their revenue production in order to make customer access easier, transactions smoother, and their services more engaging. These same organizations have aggressively embraced social media and digital channels to interact and transact with customers, vendors, and partners.
 The dramatic shift to digital channels has created an enormous digital footprint on the “public” internet, expanding the attack surface to include all externally available digital platforms. These public platforms are largely ungoverned, unmonitored and unprotected by existing perimeter and internal security technologies.
 Adversaries are increasingly targeting organizations’ public attack surface which is reflected in increased threats including targeted phishing attacks, account takeovers, credential theft, data leakage, domain spoofing, and impersonations. All of these threats pose significant risk to organizations, their brands, and their assets. The volume of external cyber threats targeting organizations continues to increase, driving a need for organizations to continuously monitor the external threat environment and to incorporate threat intelligence into their security operations.
 Protecting the public attack surface and defending against external threats is challenging. Organizations have limited visibility into their public attack surface. Traditional internal cybersecurity controls, including endpoint and perimeter solutions, do not provide visibility into or protection of the public attack surface and provide a limited view of the external threat environment. Continuously monitoring and protecting the public attack surface is difficult given its size and dynamic, unstructured nature. Additionally, many organizations continue to struggle with a scarcity of in-house cybersecurity expertise and resources.
 We believe that securing the public attack surface and protecting organizations from external threats requires a platform-based approach that combines protection, intelligence, adversary disruption, and comprehensive response capabilities, including investigative, incident response and breach response services into a single solution. An external cybersecurity platform needs to provide continuous visibility into an organization’s public attack surface and threat environment, continuous monitoring and protection, and the ability to take action to prevent attacks, limit exposure, remediate an incident, and disrupt an adversary. We believe protecting organizations from external threats, requires comprehensive response capabilities including investigative, incident response, and breach response services.

Customers rely on us to address important cybersecurity problems and challenges that they face today and look for our guidance regarding the problems they will face tomorrow. Our Platform is a cloud-native enterprise software-as-a-service application focused on providing external cybersecurity teams with comprehensive solutions to address external cybersecurity threats and risks. Our Platform employs continuous digital identification and detection, comprehensive threat intelligence and persistent adversary disruption to support a wide variety of cybersecurity use cases that address pervasive business challenges. Our customers’ adoption of the ZeroFox Platform often begins with the purchase of one or two core components and grows over time. Our Platform currently provides key capabilities across four strategic platform pillars: ZeroFox Protection, ZeroFox Intelligence, ZeroFox Disruption, and ZeroFox Response.
 ZeroFox Protection: Powered by proprietary artificial intelligence, ZeroFox Protection gives customers real-time asset and vulnerability awareness of their external-facing internet accessible digital footprint and enables organizations to configure protective capabilities to continuously protect their external assets.
 ZeroFox Protection provides technical capabilities to execute continuous attack surface identification and detection, which empowers the customer to gain an up-to-date picture of its internet accessible digital footprint. The digital presence typically includes social media accounts, collaboration platform accounts, domains, and internet-facing infrastructure, such as port, data, content, and images.
 •Domains: continuous monitoring of newly registered or observed domains related to the customer's brands and continuous analysis of domains for malicious indicators is required to ensure capturing the domain when it is hosting malicious content, code, or payloads.
 •Digital Platform Accounts: a catalog of owned digital accounts for brands, executives, individuals, locations, and products to adequately secure assets.
 •Internet-accessible Infrastructure: ensures the mapping of the external internet facing infrastructure, externally-accessible networks and digital infrastructure components.
 •Public, Private, and Proprietary Data, Content, and Images: the collection and analysis of data, content, images, and other information anywhere sensitive public, private, and proprietary information may reside on the internet to secure the customer’s enterprise.
 ZeroFox Protection’s digital risk protection capabilities cast a digital net around owned assets across the internet including digital representations for the customer’s brands, identities, systems, executives, accounts, domains, and mobile applications to secure their digital presence against targeted attacks, protect privacy, and decrease fraudulent activity across the internet.

 •Dedicated Analysts: supplement internal security teams with a dedicated threat intelligence analyst.
 ZeroFox Disruption: ZeroFox Disruption leverages our Platform to report, block, and take down an attack’s core components across the internet. Disrupting threats often takes a significant amount of time and cost to comprehensively identify and then remove from the internet. We support customers by decreasing this significant cost through automation and leveraging technology-enabled solutions to report, block, sinkhole, and take down the components of an attack across the internet. By working with our Global Disruption Network, we are able to block and redirect traffic from malicious and nefarious locations. Our disruption capabilities also provide the ability to remove personally identifiable information from numerous data broker sites to disrupt phishing, social engineering attacks, doxxing, swatting, and impersonation attacks.
ZeroFox Disruption's capabilities include:
 •Takedowns: a comprehensive, scalable, managed takedown service that removes offending or sensitive content on the customer’s behalf across social networks, mobile app stores, domains, data broker sites, and others with automated request submission.


•Global Disruption Network: distribution of threat indicators to our network of partners, including leading network providers, internet service providers, hosting providers, cloud providers, and content distribution networks, to block internet traffic from navigating to malicious locations across the web.
 ZeroFox Response: ZeroFox Response enables organizations to provide the required 24x7 level of support necessary to quickly respond to cyber incidents including external attacks, data loss or exfiltration, ransomware, and potential breaches. With the global increase in computer generated information and data that is stored in the cloud, nearly every organization is more vulnerable to some level of external cyber threats and risk. These threats and risks are often exploited by persistent, malicious actors and criminals around the world, resulting in breaches, other types of disruption, or compromise of varying intensity and scale.
 ZeroFox Response includes incident response services as well as a comprehensive data breach notification and response solution as a managed service for the breached enterprise. Our breach response solution is designed to comply with federal and state privacy and data breach notification laws and regulations in order to reduce overall risks to the breached enterprise.

We have key reference customers in many industry verticals including education, energy, entertainment, financial services, government healthcare, media, retail, services, and technology that we believe validate our solutions in the market. Our customers range from small and medium-sized organizations to Fortune 500 companies.
 
We have a single government customer that accounted for 47% of our revenue for the Successor Period. Excluding this customer, no single customer accounted for more than 3% percent of our revenue for the Successor Period.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our sales team is bifurcated into two sub-organizations: a new customer acquisition team and a customer success team. These teams are further structured into named-account sales teams that focus on targeted customer verticals, regions, and customer size. Most of our current business is in North America and as such, the team structure is proportionate in size and focus to the geographic distribution of our existing customer base. Members of the account management team are focused on creating successful customer outcomes, renewing customer subscriptions, and expanding platform adoption to drive customer upsell values.


In alignment with our corporate strategy, we are a channel-first organization. Our go-to-market strategy leverages our partner community to reach our desired customer cohorts. In North America, we generally rely on a single tier, value-added reseller and partner community. In other regions, we may employ a two-tiered approach by leveraging a network of distributors who then manage the various channel partners within desired territories or regions.
 Our comprehensive marketing strategy focuses on an inbound marketing model designed to efficiently deliver high contact-to-opportunity conversion rates and pipeline velocity. We execute field, partner, and demand programs to drive ongoing engagement with prospects and leverage our sales development organization to mature those engagements into sales pipeline opportunities. Once prospects become customers, we continue engagement with solution-oriented content created by ZeroFox experts and executives through numerous collaboration channels designed to drive increased customer revenue and optimize our customers’ long-term value. Additionally, we conduct webinars and podcasts, participate in cybersecurity industry events, and utilize our product marketing team to drive market awareness through thought leadership. The sophistication and experience of the ZeroFox threat intelligence enables us to package our thought leadership into daily and weekly threat intelligence reports, quarterly threat landscape reports, and annual threat reports. Other tactics leveraged to maximize inbound traffic include paid media, content syndication, social media, outbound campaigns, public relations, and remarketing advertising. These tactics frequently rely on the ZeroFox website to drive awareness, education, and opportunity conversion on the ZeroFox Platform’s broad set of artificial intelligence capabilities. Furthermore, the website has been optimized to assist with lead conversion in mobile, tablet, and traditional desktop engagements. Marketing automation workflows continuously engage prospects throughout the buyers’ journey with thought leadership and solution-centric content to advance their understanding of our Platform's value proposition.
 Our global field and partner marketing strategy is designed to maximize the leverage of partner ecosystems and build brand engagement at regional and territory levels to drive and accelerate pipeline growth. We have strong participation in many prominent cybersecurity conferences and trade shows across many global geographies to expand our brand reach. In alignment with our sales approach, we have a channel-first sales and marketing strategy. We utilize technology-enabled communication and collaboration with partners at all sales lifecycle stages, from demand generation through technical validation and close. We believe that we have a state-of-the-art partner portal that allows global partners to take advantage of all aspects of our marketing strategy and content. The content on the partner portal provides partners with accelerated readiness through rapid product innovations to drive demand within their customer base and ensures their sales and technical teams are familiar with the latest capabilities of our Platform.

We maintain a continuous integration and continuous delivery release framework to update and enhance our Platform and its modular capabilities. We can seamlessly deploy real-time upgrades with no downtime by leveraging our on-demand platform model.
Competition
 The market for external cybersecurity solutions is competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards, and by frequent new product and service offerings and improvements. We see competition from the following categories:
 •digital risk protection and threat intelligence providers such as Forta (through its acquisition of Phishlabs), Mimecast, Proofpoint, Recorded Future, Bolster, and Reliaquest (through its acquisition of Digital Shadows) who primarily focus on select niche sub-sector categories within security;
 •broad infrastructure security vendors such as CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, and Rapid7, through its acquisition of IntSights, who are supplementing their traditional endpoint or network security solutions with threat intelligence solutions;
 •broad technology providers, such as Google and Microsoft that continue to invest in adding cybersecurity capabilities to their offerings;
 •data breach response services providers, such as Experian, Kroll, and Transunion, that have dedicated units focused on data breach response service offerings;
 •identity and privacy identity protection providers such as NortonLifeLock, Experian, and Transunion who are focusing on driving consumer awareness and adoption of credit-related protection services; and
 •managed security service and system integrator solution providers such as Secureworks (formerly Dell Secureworks), IBM, and Accenture who are using people to augment their combined technology offerings.
 We believe that our external cybersecurity solutions offer advantages as compared to products offered by our competitors based on the following factors:
 •ability of our Platform to address the entire external cybersecurity lifecycle with protection, intelligence, adversary disruption, and response associated with cyberattacks and incursions; 
 •ability of our artificial-intelligence powered platform and human threat intelligence team to acquire global data sets at scale on behalf of our customers;
 •ability of our Platform and related service capabilities to assist our customers from the discovery of a potential cyber breach through notification and protection of the enterprise by ensuring compliance with federal and state privacy and breach response laws and regulations, as well as the risks of harm to those individuals impacted by the breach and compromise of personal information;
 •ability of our Platform to leverage artificial intelligence to analyze data efficiently and effectively at scale to help customers achieve a wide variety of security protections;
 •ability of our Platform’s App Library integrations to drive enhanced value to customers through partner technology workflow automation and enhanced data contextualization; 
 •ability of our Platform to drive in-platform policy orchestration enabling customers to automate ZeroFox-centric workflows; and
 •ability of our Platform to provide full adversary kill chain disruption capabilities by automating the process for removal of malicious or infringing content and providing the ability to coordinate and/or integrate with several partners to disrupt cyberattacks.


Intellectual Property
 The intellectual property rights we hold are a foundational asset in our portfolio and are core to our long-term strategy to create stockholder value. We rely on intellectual property protection under law (patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets) and leverage our rights through various agreements, including license agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure, and assignment of inventions agreements. We believe all these intellectual property rights enable us to be a leading provider of innovative, cloud-based external cybersecurity solutions. We attract both customers and employee talent from our market leadership position in innovation.
 From inception, we anchored our business’ value proposition to the rapid creation of intellectual property; today this objective remains central to our Platform, capabilities, technology, and go-to-market strategy. Since then, we have ambitiously expanded our intellectual property portfolio by creating new inventions, tradecraft, and proprietary know-how stemming from our operational experience and research and development efforts.
 •ZeroFox has 31 issued patents, 26 of which are in the U.S., and 6 pending patent applications; these include intellectual property relating to attack surface identification, threat intelligence and digital risk protection. The active patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2041. In addition, ZeroFox owns dozens of trademark registrations throughout the world and numerous registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.zerofox.com.
 •Identify Theft Guard Solutions, Inc. (“ITGS”), has 3 issued patents and 2 pending patent applications in the U.S., covering IP in breach response and privacy protection. The active patents are expected to expire between 2031 and 2039. ITGS also has 10 registered trademarks and 1 pending trademark registrations in the U.S. and multiple registered domain names.
 We will continue to invest in the innovation and development of our intellectual property portfolio through business acquisitions, technology alliance and strategic licensing relationships, and ongoing research and development. Our intellectual property rights will be at risk because invalidation, circumvention and third-party intellectual property claims, and litigation remain possible. In addition, our industry is competitive so the intellectual property created by our competitors could limit the adoption of our technologies and products.
 We believe competitors may try to develop products that are similar to ours and that they may infringe our intellectual property rights. Competitors or other third parties may also claim that our Platform and other solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims.


Despite our best efforts to protect and aggressively expand our intellectual property rights, there is always the potential that they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. The cybersecurity industry is characterized by the existence of a large and expanding number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe our approach to constantly invest in intellectual property is a meaningful component of our corporate strategy to mitigate intellectual property risk and liability. As an organization, we may elect to protect our intellectual property rights and challenge our competitor’s infringing use of such rights. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products or solutions, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay damages, royalties, or other fees.
 For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.”
 Backlog
 We enter into both single and multi-year subscription contracts for our solutions. We generally invoice the entire amount at contract signing prior to commencement of the subscription period. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements, and are considered backlog. As of January 31, 2023, we had $54.0 million in total deferred revenue, which excluded backlog of approximately $61.5 million. Of this amount, approximately $54.2 million is expected to be billed in fiscal year 2024. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing and duration of customer renewals. Because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as new and renewing contracts during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future revenue performance.
Human Capital
 As of January 31, 2023, we employed 721 employees and 18 contractors. Our workforce is geographically distributed across the United States and various other locations around the world. None of our current employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced work stoppages. We consider our employee relations to be in good standing and we invest in them. We value our employees as a meaningful asset to our Company.
Attracting, Retaining, and Developing Talent
 Our people team designs and implements key initiatives and employs business-driven human resources programs to recruit, hire, empower, develop, assess, and retain industry talent. First, we aim to build an effective team by leveraging our global footprint to find the right people, in the right geographies and place them into the right roles. Next, we empower employees to take ownership in their work while providing them with the tools, resources, and time to do their jobs well. We invest in our staff, offering coaching, training, and other support to develop short- and long-term skills and provide them with opportunities for career growth. Our semi-annual performance management cycle, which is purposefully decoupled from compensation discussions to encourage non-biased dialogue, encompasses both look back and look ahead elements to celebrate success, make improvements, and develop competencies to address future business needs.
Diversity and Inclusion
 Our corporate culture is built on the goal of creating a diverse and inclusive environment where employees’ unique opinions and feedback are respected, desired, and acted upon. As a team, employees constantly collaborate and work together to set policy, communicate openly, and drive an environment of transparency. For example, we frequently have global town hall meetings where the agenda is set by employees, hosted by employees that volunteer to emcee each event, and where multiple regions and business units are always recognizing their achievements and successes.
 Each global town hall has a segment referred to as "Fellow Foxes", where employees have the opportunity to thank and recognize their peers anonymously or openly in front of the entire company. It is not uncommon to see dozens of Fellow Foxes recognized in a single town hall; Fellow Foxes love to work hard and recognize their teammates.
 The Fellow Foxes practice is an example of the framework and value system that has been built to recognize and reward employees based upon meritocracy. We believe that most talent not only wants to be listened to but also challenged and rewarded where they can rise to their full potential and deliver their top performance in a healthy, fun work environment. Our workforce’s ability to execute relentlessly in pursuit of company objectives is both a primary differentiator and a critical component contributing to our success.
 To ensure that we retain a highly capable workforce that represents a variety of diverse backgrounds and complies with contractual obligations and local compliance regulations, we regularly benchmark our program against industry standards, diversity objectives, and key employee drivers.
 Employee Health & Safety / COVID-19
 We are committed to protecting the physical well-being of our employees, families, and customers. To address the evolving complexities introduced by COVID-19, we have and will continue to take multiple steps to promote safety, realign workforce planning strategy, and support employee needs while continuing to drive customer satisfaction. We regularly review and update our health and safety plan based on guidelines, rules and capabilities issued by local, regional, and countrywide healthcare organizations. At present, a large majority of employees work from home. In select geographies some employees can optionally work out of a local office in a hybrid environment, and there is another group of employees that work primarily in the office. As the world reopens and employees potentially transition back toward an office setting, our offices have reopened with modified configurations based on requirements and recommendations from local, state, national government, and health institutions. Concurrently, we have used a phased approach that entails re-classifying ongoing work locations across all roles and implementing a flexible hybrid work model where appropriate.
 While onsite, we have protocols in place to help keep employees, customers, and other visitors safe. We exercise an abundance of caution where safety is concerned and are ultimately prepared, resourced and equipped to exceed customer expectations, whether working onsite or remote.


Government Regulation
 As a provider of external cybersecurity solutions, our business is potentially subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, protection, transfer, and processing of business data, personal data, and other sensitive information. Certain aspects of our offerings may involve access to and use of personally identifiable information and other sensitive data. The nature of cybersecurity product, identity offerings and related services requires the collection of various types of data. In the operation of our business, we may collect the types of data covered by these laws and regulations including personally identifiable information, information about an individual’s health and financial information about individuals. To the extent we are in possession of such data and these various laws and regulations are determined to apply to us, this could require us to adopt additional operational, technological and security measures to protect and manage such information which could increase our costs of operations. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could also result in monetary fines and reputational damage which would have a negative impact on our business. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, the Electronic Communication Privacy Act (“ECPA”), Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GBLA”), and the HIPAA/HITECH Act. In addition to these, other laws and regulations relating to cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions, data collection and data localization may apply to our business as we expand outside of the U.S. market.
 Our business is also subject to laws relating to import and export control such as U.S. export licensing requirements, trade and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act.
 We believe that we are in material compliance with the laws and regulations that are applicable to us.
 Many of these laws and regulations, such as those related to data protection and privacy, are frequently being revised and new laws in different jurisdictions are being adopted. Therefore, we must continually evolve our business practices to satisfy these regulatory obligations. We have policies and procedures that we rely on to satisfy these requirements and are transparent with our customers regarding our business practices, product features and types of data that are collected when a customer uses our security solutions. In addition to the existing regulatory framework applicable to our business, some governments are considering whether to take a more active role in regulating the cybersecurity industry and, in the U.S., there are efforts to have the federal government regulate digital platform companies. New regulations in these two areas could impact our go-to-market model. Therefore, we keep abreast of these potential changes and how they may impact our business.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks of our business associated with such laws and regulations.
