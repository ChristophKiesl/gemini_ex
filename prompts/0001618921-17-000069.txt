Recent transactions
On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. See note 6, acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”) common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. Following the August 25, 2016 warrant exercise, we do not hold any further warrants to purchase shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. As of August 31, 2017 and 2016, we owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares, representing approximately 26% and 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock, respectively, and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. As of August 31, 2017, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate a second member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. The warrants were issued in March 2013 pursuant to a Framework Agreement between Walgreens, Alliance Boots GmbH (“Alliance Boots”) and AmerisourceBergen. Concurrently, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various other agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.
Effective March 18, 2016, we began accounting for our investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See note 5, equity method investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.

On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure, with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots that Walgreens did not previously own (the “Second Step Transaction”) in exchange for £3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The Consolidated Financial Statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.

In addition, we have completed a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow our businesses and enhance our competitive position. Please refer to management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below and note 3, exit and disposal activities, note 5, equity method investments and note 6, acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below for additional information.
Rite Aid transaction
Terminated acquisition of Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”) and related matters
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance (as amended as described below, the “Merger 
- 2 -

Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States. The Merger Agreement was amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto on January 29, 2017.
In connection with regulatory review of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on December 20, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid announced that they had entered into an agreement (the “Fred’s Asset Purchase Agreement”), subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to sell certain Rite Aid stores and certain assets related to store operations to Fred’s, Inc. (“Fred’s”) for $950 million in an all-cash transaction.

On June 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid entered into a mutual termination agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby, or entered pursuant thereto (other than as expressly specified) (collectively with the Merger Agreement, the “Transaction Documents”), effective as of June 28, 2017. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company paid Rite Aid the termination fee of $325 million, in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Merger Agreement and other Transaction Documents. The parties also agreed to release each other from, among other things, any and all liability, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, damages, expenses and fees, however arising, in connection with, arising out of or related to the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated therein or thereby or certain related matters.
On June 28, 2017, following the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Fred’s Asset Purchase Agreement was terminated. In connection with the termination of the Fred’s Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company reimbursed $25 million of Fred’s transaction costs in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Fred’s Asset Purchase Agreement. 
See note 8, borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement and related matters.
Acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets
On June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Rite Aid, pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid. 
On September 19, 2017, the Company announced it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement (the “Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement”) to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. As of the date of this report, the first few Rite Aid stores have been acquired. Ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases, with the goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018. These transfers remain subject to closing conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement. 
The Company will account for this transaction as a business combination.
Industry overview
The retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. We believe the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs, and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients.
The retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the 
- 3 -

“ACA”) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the United States and the UK Department of Health plans to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service by reducing drug reimbursement rates. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the United States and pharmacy reimbursements in the UK. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. When third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.
Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers. We expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion”. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars.
We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management.
Segments
Our operations are organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments: 


• | Retail Pharmacy USA;


• | Retail Pharmacy International; and


• | Pharmaceutical Wholesale.

For fiscal 2017, our segment sales were:  Retail Pharmacy USA, $87.3 billion; Retail Pharmacy International, $11.8 billion; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, $21.2 billion. Additional information relating to our segments is included in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below and in note 17, segment reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
Retail Pharmacy USA
Our Retail Pharmacy USA division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. We operated 8,100 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2017. Our principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. We are a market leader in the United States and, as of August 31, 2017, approximately 76% of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy.
We provide customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise such as NICE!, DeLish™, Soap and Glory, No7, and Well at Walgreens, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across America. Integrated with our e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive alerts when a refill is due and perform retail functionality, such as ordering photo prints, shopping for products and clipping coupons.
Our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. We utilize our retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to our customers and patients, as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. We also provide specialty pharmacy and mail services. As of August 31, 2017, we had approximately 400 in-store clinic locations throughout the United States, some of which are operated by the Company and 
- 4 -

some of which are operated by health system partners. We have more than 78,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals.
The components of the division’s sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the division’s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows:

 | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2016 | | Fiscal 2015
Pharmacy | 69 | % | | 67 | % | 66 | %
Retail | 31 | % | | 33 | % | 34 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

We filled 764.4 million prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal 2017. Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 989.7 million in fiscal 2017. Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately 98% of the division’s fiscal 2017 pharmacy sales.
We fill prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4% of the division’s fiscal 2017 sales. Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 19% of the division’s fiscal 2017 sales.
Our U.S. loyalty program, Balance® Rewards, is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance® Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreens.com. As of August 31, 2017, the number of active Balance® Rewards members totaled 88.2 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.
AmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division’s pharmacies. We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.
The division’s sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion, we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods.
The current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.
We continuously face reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers; our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect these pressures to continue.
We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time.
Our 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription.

Retail Pharmacy International
Our Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. We operated 4,722 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2017 (see properties in part I, item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage), and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years. Our principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve.
The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Soap & Glory, Liz Earle, Sleek MakeUp, Botanics, and ‘only at Boots’ exclusive products, together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care. Our brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development capabilities.
Our retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the United Kingdom, through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, our ‘order and collect’ service allows customers to order from a range of over 35,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect from noon the following day from approximately 99% of the United Kingdom’s retail stores as of August 31, 2017.
The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2017, the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled 15.5 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.
In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 637 practices, of which 178 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2017. Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices.
The components of the division’s sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services).
The division’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the division’s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the division’s fiscal year sales were as follows:

 | Fiscal 2017 | | Fiscal 2016 | | Fiscal 20151
Pharmacy | 35 | % | | 35 | % | 37 | %
Retail | 65 | % | | 65 | % | 63 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

1    Fiscal 2015 includes periods subsequent to the Second Step Transaction (January through August 2015).
The division’s Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically our and our competitors pricing actions, promotional offers and events and our customer’s desire for value and convenience.
The division’s Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom, which is the division’s largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis. In fiscal 2018, the UK Department of Health has indicated that they plan to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service, the publicly-funded healthcare system.
In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pound Sterling being the most significant.

Pharmaceutical Wholesale
Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than 110,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from 289 distribution centers in 11 countries, primarily in Europe, as of August 31, 2017.
The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the division’s sales. Our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. We also offer customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, our pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of August 31, 2017, had over 6,300 members.
In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers which are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies, and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand).
Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. We are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate.
The division’s sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on our revenues. However, in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions.
Changes in manufacturers’ product distribution business models can also impact the division’s sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts, as we only recognize sales for the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including our pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a fee-for-service basis.
In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The division’s sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions.
Intellectual property and licenses
We market products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own numerous domain names, hold numerous patents, have registered numerous trademarks and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. We hold assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of our business.
Seasonal variations in business
Our business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers. See summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in note 19, supplementary financial information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below.
Sources and availability of raw materials
Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions.
- 7 -

Working capital practices
Effective inventory management is important to our operations. We use various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. We generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. For additional information, see the liquidity and capital resources section in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below.
Customers
We sell to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. Two payers accounted for approximately 25% of the Retail Pharmacy USA division’s sales in fiscal 2017. One payer in the Retail Pharmacy International division accounted for approximately 18% of the division’s sales in fiscal 2017.
Regulation
In the countries in which we do business, we are subject to national, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to our participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”); the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of our businesses. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions.
We are also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which we do business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of our businesses, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on our results of operations or capital expenditures in fiscal 2017.
Competitive conditions
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, we compete with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. Our pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. We compete primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Our geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See “properties” in part I, item 2 below for further information regarding our geographic dispersion.
Employees
As of August 31, 2017, we employed approximately 345,000 persons, approximately 110,000 of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of unconsolidated partially-owned entities.

Research and development
While our global brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development capabilities, the amount we spend on research and development activities is not material.
Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales
Prior to completion of the Second Step Transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting and as a result, no Alliance Boots sales were included in our sales prior to December 31, 2014. In fiscal 2015, all our sales prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014 occurred within the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots results have been fully consolidated. Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations, including total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, is included in note 17, segment reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. See “risk factors” in part I, item 1A below for information regarding risks attendant to our foreign operations.

We make available free of charge on or through our website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them to the SEC. The contents of our website are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K or our other SEC filings.
