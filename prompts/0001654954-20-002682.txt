  Overview
  
 SharpSpring, Inc. (the “Company”) is a cloud-based marketing technology company. The SharpSpring platform is designed to improve the way that businesses communicate with their prospects and customers to increase sales. The Company’s flagship marketing automation platform uses advanced features such as web tracking, lead scoring and automated workflow to help businesses deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. The SharpSpring platform is designed and built as a Software as Service (or SaaS) offering. We provide our products on a subscription basis, with additional fees charged if specified volume limits are exceeded by our customers.
  
 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities that comprise our Perfect Audience platform. The Perfect Audience expands our product and service offering into advertisement retargeting for small businesses.

  Markets & Competition
  
  SharpSpring
  
 Our SharpSpring product competes primarily in the marketing automation market. The market for marketing automation software and related solutions is evolving, highly competitive with expected competition to increase as barriers decrease as does complexity of the technology decreases. SharpSpring entered the market in 2014 with a highly competitive offering that achieved meaningful customer adoption in its first few years after launch. As of December 31, 2019, SharpSpring had approximately 2,500 paying customers and approximately 9,000 businesses using the platform, including agencies, agency clients, and direct end-user customers. We face competition from cloud-based software and SaaS companies, including HubSpot, Act-On, Pardot (part of Salesforce.com), ActiveCampaign and Infusionsoft. We differentiate ourselves from the competition with the integration of specific tools designed for digital marketing agencies, and with SharpSpring’s advanced features, ease of use, platform flexibility, and value compared to other competitive offerings. SharpSpring is designed as a solution for small or mid-sized businesses but focuses on selling to marketing agencies, who serve as partners providing a distribution channel to their clients.
  
 Since its inception, the majority of our SharpSpring customers have been digital marketing agencies. A digital marketing agency is a firm that specializes in helping clients, usually small or mid-sized businesses, with their digital marketing initiatives like websites, email marketing, search engine optimization, social campaigns, pay-per-click advertising and other digital lead generation activities. We have built special tools in the SharpSpring application to allow agencies to manage their clients on the platform and optimize their efforts across their portfolio. We also have special pricing to agency customers to allow them the flexibility to resell the platform at a profit and manage their client relationships. In general, when we sell SharpSpring to an agency customer, we provide the agency with a SharpSpring license for the agency to use, plus a 3-pack of client licenses for the agency to deploy to their client base. This agency license and the pack of licenses are generally sold for a monthly recurring fee, plus an up-front onboarding fee. The agency has complete discretion over the pricing of the platform to their clients for the use, implementation, and services related to SharpSpring. If an agency utilizes its pack of licenses and adds additional clients on to the platform, there is a monthly per-client fee charged to the agency based on the number of additional licenses the agency has deployed to their clients. Additionally, we charge customers for certain items if the volume or transactional limits are exceeded, such as emails sent or contacts stored in the platform. In most cases, we provide support to the agency and the agency provides support to their clients on the platform. However, for additional fees, we can provide product support to the agency’s client directly. Our objective is to partner with the agencies to grow and expand our businesses together using the SharpSpring platform.
  
  SharpSpring Mail+
  
 Approximately one-fifth of our marketing automation customers are individual businesses that have licensed SharpSpring directly without working through an agency. We refer to these customers as “Direct Customers.” Similar to agency customers, Direct Customers pay a monthly subscription fee for the use of the platform, plus an up-front onboarding fee. Additionally, we charge Direct Customers additional transactional charges based on usage over certain limits.

 SharpSpring Mail+ was launched in 2016, as a replacement to the GraphicMail product that was acquired in 2014. SharpSpring Mail+ provides customers with an advanced email marketing and marketing automation tool. It includes traditional email campaign management solutions like design capabilities, reporting tools and list management functionality, but also includes additional features like dynamic email content and SharpSpring’s visitor ID tool that are more typically found in a marketing automation solution. SharpSpring Mail+ competes with companies such as Constant Contact, iContact Corporation, The Rocket Science Group, LLC (MailChimp®), and VerticalResponse, Inc., a subsidiary of Deluxe Corporation, as well as other email and marketing automation companies. SharpSpring Mail+, and most other vendors, typically charge a monthly fee or a fee per number of emails sent and, in some cases, they have a free offering for low-volume or non-profit customers. SharpSpring Mail+’s rich feature set is the primary key market differentiator.
  
  Perfect Audience
  
 The Perfect Audience platform was acquired in November of 2019 to enhance the Company’s product and service offering. The Perfect Audience cloud-based platform enables multi-channel retargeting to known leads, plus targeted advertising to new prospects via lookalike audience functionality. It empowers marketers to create, manage, and optimize their ad campaigns across thousands of sites all within one, simple-to-use interface. Perfect Audience adds powerful lead functionality that fuels top-of-the-funnel lead generation efforts, plus additional lead nurturing capabilities to maximize middle-of-the-funnel conversion. These features complement SharpSpring’s core feature set designed to track, nurture, and convert those leads into sales.
  
 We are part of a continually evolving and highly competitive marketplace. Most of our competitors have more extensive customer bases, broader customer relationships, longer operating histories, and greater name recognition than we have. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services. Barriers to entry exist in the marketing automation market due to complexity of systems, but are decreasing as technology complexity decreases.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
 We sell our products globally, through our internal sales teams, and to a lesser extent, third party resellers. We use and rely on our own SharpSpring marketing automation platform to help our business generate leads, convert more leads to sales and monitor the effectiveness of all our marketing campaigns. Our website www.sharpspring.com serves as a lead generation source and we use a variety of other digital marketing tools and marketing campaigns to attract new customers.

 Our SharpSpring product sales process involves targeting customers, completing product demos, and advancing customers through our marketing and sales pipeline to conversion using our SharpSpring marketing automation product. Since SharpSpring was launched fairly recently in 2014, brand recognition today is growing, but still fairly limited. Therefore, we are more reliant on our marketing campaigns and search engine traffic to attract potential leads. Our marketing efforts to date have been nearly focused on digital marketing agencies, and we have had success signing up over 1,800 marketing agency partners as of December 31, 2019. These agencies become customers and are able to resell SharpSpring to their clients, while paying increased fees to us as their client count expands beyond the base license pack. This allows the agency to provide services and first-level support for their clients, which increases their own revenues from the end client and creates a longer-lasting relationship overall between the agency and client. We also sell SharpSpring directly to end-users and have over 500 direct end user customers on the platform. The Company’s sales are done primarily through internal resources, but a small number of third-party resellers were also used during 2019.
  
 The SharpSpring Mail+ product was created in 2016 to migrate GraphicMail customers to the SharpSpring platform. Since that time, we spent limited resources marketing and selling SharpSpring Mail+ as a standalone product and we discontinued its sale to new customers during early 2018. We currently intend to continue supporting SharpSpring Mail+, but may decide to discontinue the SharpSpring Mail+ product altogether in the future. The SharpSpring Mail+ product generated approximately $0.22 million of revenue during 2019.

  Customers
  
 As of December 31, 2019, we had over 2,500 customers for our SharpSpring product, the majority of which were marketing agencies who resell SharpSpring to their clients. Including agency partners, agency clients and direct end user customers, we had over 9,000 businesses using the SharpSpring platform as of December 31, 2019.
  
 As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 400 customers using our SharpSpring Mail+ product.
  
 As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1600 customers using our Perfect Audience platform.
  
 The vast majority of our customers are on month-to-month agreements, with a mixture of customers being charged in advance and in arrears. We have a small number of customers that prepay for longer periods, such as quarterly or annually. Perfect Audience customers generally are not locked into a month-to-month contract and pay for usage of the platform at the time of use.

Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
