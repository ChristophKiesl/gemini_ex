The Company's vehicle cockpit electronics business comprises and is reported under the Electronics segment. In addition to the Electronics segment, the Company had residual operations in South America and Europe previously associated with the Interiors and Climate businesses, sold or exited by December 31, 2016, but not subject to discontinued operations classification that comprised Other.
The pie charts below highlight the sales breakdown for Visteon's Electronics segment for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
The Company’s History
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in January 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company (“Ford” or “Ford Motor Company”). Subsequently, Ford transferred the assets and liabilities comprising its automotive components and systems business to Visteon. The Company separated from Ford in June 2000 when all of the Company’s common stock was distributed by Ford to its shareholders. After filing for bankruptcy in 2009 as a result of the recession, the Company emerged from bankruptcy in 2010 and in 2012 implemented a comprehensive shareholder value creation plan which involved the transformation milestones below. 
Transformation Milestones
The Company previously operated Climate, Interiors, and Electronics product lines. Over the last three years, the Company has transformed the business operations into a pure-play supplier of automotive cockpit electronics and connected car solutions. 
A summary of the most recent milestones completing the transformation are summarized below:

• | Exit of Climate Business - On June 9, 2015, Visteon Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, VIHI, LLC (collectively, “Visteon”) completed the sale to Hahn & Co. Auto Holdings Co., Ltd. and Hankook Tire Co., Ltd. (together, the “Purchasers”) of all of its shares of Halla Visteon Climate Control Corporation, a Korean corporation (“HVCC”), for approximately $3.4 billion, or KRW 52,000 per share, after adjusting for the 2014 dividend paid by HVCC to Visteon (the “Climate Transaction”), pursuant to and in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2014, among Visteon and the Purchasers. The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion and recognized a pretax gain of approximately $2.3 billion in connection with the closing of the Climate Transaction in the second quarter 2015.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company sold its South Africa climate operations with 2015 annual sales of $9 million for proceeds of $2 million, and recorded a loss of $11 million related to foreign currency translation amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

• | Exit of Interiors Business - During 2014, the Company divested the majority of its global Interiors business (the "Interiors Divestiture"). Subsequently, Visteon completed the sale of its Interiors operations in Thailand on February 2, 2015. On December 1, 2016 the Company completed the sale of its Interiors operations in Argentina and Brazil, incurring a loss of $19 million representing the final working capital cash contribution and related contractual obligations, representing the completion of the Interiors Divestiture. 

On December 1, 2015, Visteon completed the sale and transfer of its equity ownership in Visteon Deutschland GmbH, which operated the Berlin, Germany interiors plant ("Germany Interiors Divestiture"). The Company contributed cash, of approximately $141 million, assets of $27 million, and liabilities of $198 million including pension related liabilities. The Company will make a final contribution payment of approximately $31 million during the first half of 2017 upon fulfillment of buyer contractual commitments, included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as "Other current liabilities" as of December 31, 2016. 

• | Enhance Shareholder Returns - In connection with the Climate Transaction, the Company returned approximately $2.75 billion of cash to shareholders through 2016 via a series of actions including share buybacks and special distributions.

During 2015, the Company entered into two share buyback programs. Under the first program, the Company repurchased 4,771,262 shares of common stock at an average settlement price of $104.79. The first buyback program concluded in 2015. The second program started during the fourth quarter of 2015 and concluded on March 1, 2016. Under the second program, the Company paid approximately $105 million to repurchase 1,607,849 shares at an average price of $65.05.  
On December 9, 2015, the Company declared a special distribution of $43.40 per share of its common stock outstanding as of January 15, 2016, or approximately $1.75 billion in the aggregate. On January 22, 2016 approximately $1.74 billion was distributed to shareholders. An additional amount of approximately $15 million will be paid over a two-year period as related to the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based share units previously granted to the Company's employees. These amounts were classified as "Distribution payable" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. 
On March 1, 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share buyback ("ASB") program with a third-party financial institution to purchase shares of Visteon common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $395 million. Under the program, the Company paid the financial institution $395 million and received an initial delivery of 4,370,678 shares of common stock using a reference price of $72.30. The program was concluded on October 14, 2016 and the Company received an additional 1,211,979 shares. In total, the Company purchased 5,582,657 shares at an average price of $70.75 under this ASB program. 
On January 10, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $400 million of common stock to be executed through March 2018.
The Company's strategic initiatives going forward are outlined in Item 7 "Executive Summary" of this Report. 
The Company’s Industry
The Company operates in the automotive industry, which is cyclical and highly sensitive to general economic conditions. The Company believes that future success in the automotive industry is, in part, dependent on alignment with customers to support their efforts to effectively meet the challenges associated with the following significant trends and developments in the global automotive industry.

• | Electronic content and connectivity - The electronic content of vehicles continues to increase due to various regulatory requirements and consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality. The use of electronic components can reduce weight, expedite assembly, enhance fuel economy, improve emissions, increase safety and enhance vehicle performance. Additionally, digital and portable technologies have dramatically influenced the lifestyle of today’s consumers, who expect products that enable such a lifestyle. This requires increased electronic and technical content such as in-vehicle communication, navigation and entertainment capabilities. While original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") are taking different paths to connect their vehicles to high-speed broadband internet connections in the short-term, future vehicles are expected to be built with vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity systems. There is momentum by OEMs to integrate discrete electronic

4

control units into a multi-core domain controller to increase efficiency and reduce power consumption, cost and weight. The industry continues to advance toward semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. 

• | Safety - Governments continue to focus regulatory efforts on safer transportation. Accordingly, OEMs are working to improve occupant and pedestrian safety by incorporating more safety-oriented content in their vehicles. Suppliers must enable the safety initiatives of their customers including the development of new technologies. 


• | Vehicle standardization - OEMs continue to standardize vehicle platforms on a global basis, resulting in a lower number of individual vehicle platforms, design cost savings and further scale of economies through the production of a greater number of models from each platform. Having operations in the geographic markets in which OEMs produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet OEMs’ needs more economically and efficiently, thus making global coverage a source of significant competitive advantage for suppliers with a diverse global footprint. Additionally, OEMs are looking to suppliers for increased collaboration to lower costs, reduce risks and decrease overall time to market. Suppliers that can provide fully engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.

Head-Up Displays 
The Company provides a complete line of head-up displays ("HUD") that present critical information to the driver in a convenient location and at a comfortable focal distance. Combiner HUD projects a virtual image in front of the driver using a compact, transparent screen mounted on top of the instrument panel. Windshield HUD projects the image directly on the vehicle windscreen. The Company has demonstrated an augmented reality system that overlays graphics in the driver’s line of sight to represent objects in the vehicle’s path; provides navigation guidance; and displays relevant information, such as a lane departure warning. 
The Company’s Customers
The Company sells its products primarily to global vehicle manufacturers including Ford, Mazda, Nissan/Renault, General Motors, Honda, BMW and Daimler. Ford, Mazda and Nissan/Renault are the Company's largest customers and in 2016 accounted for sales of approximately 30%, 17% and 15%, respectively. In 2015 and 2014, Ford accounted for 34% and 41%, respectively. Mazda and Nissan/Renault accounted for 16% and 14% of sales for 2015 and did not individually account for greater than 10% of sales for 2014.
The Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Price reductions are typically negotiated on an annual basis between suppliers and OEMs. Such reductions are intended to take into account expected annual reductions in the overall cost to the supplier of providing products and services to the customer, through such factors as manufacturing productivity enhancements, material cost reductions and design-related cost improvements. The Company has an aggressive cost reduction program that focuses on reducing its total costs, which are intended to offset customer price reductions. However, there can be no assurance that the Company’s cost reduction efforts will be sufficient to fully offset such price reductions. The Company records price reductions when probable and reasonably estimable. 
The Company’s Competition
The automotive sector is concentrated, but operates under highly competitive conditions resulting from the globalized nature of the industry, high fixed costs and the resulting need for scale economies, market dynamics including share in mature economies and positioning in emerging economies, and the low cost of switching for the end consumer. Accordingly, OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of financial viability, product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design and manufacturing capability and flexibility, customer service and overall management. The Company's primary independent competitors include Alpine Electronics, Continental AG, Delphi Automotive PLC, Denso Corporation, Harman International, Nippon Seiki, Panasonic Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and Robert Bosch GmbH.

The Company’s Product Sales Backlog
The Company defines backlog as cumulative remaining life-of-program expected net sales, launching in future periods. The Company’s Electronics segment backlog was $16.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, compared to $14.9 billion as of December 31, 2015, reflecting an increase of 10.7%. The Company’s estimated net sales may be impacted by various assumptions, including new program vehicle production levels, customer price reductions, currency exchange rates and program launch timing. In addition, the Company typically enters into customer agreements at the beginning of a vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill purchasing requirements for the entire vehicle production life cycle. These agreements may be terminated by customers at any time and, accordingly, expected net sales information does not represent firm orders or firm commitments.
The Company’s Business is Seasonal and Cyclical
Historically, the Company’s business has been moderately seasonal because its largest North American customers typically cease production for approximately two weeks in July for model year changeovers and approximately one week in December during the winter holidays. Customers in Europe historically shut down vehicle production during a portion of August and one week in December. In China, customers typically shut down approximately one week in early October and one week in January or February.  Additionally, third quarter automotive production traditionally is lower as new vehicle models enter production.
The Company’s Workforce and Employee Relations
The Company’s workforce as of December 31, 2016 included approximately 10,000 persons, of which approximately 5,000 were salaried employees and 5,000 were hourly workers. Many of the Company’s employees are members of industrial trade unions and confederations within their respective countries, including Europe, Asia and South America. Many of these organizations operate under collectively bargained contracts that are not specific to any one employer. The Company constantly works to establish and maintain positive, cooperative relations with its unions and work representatives around the world and believes that its relationships with unionized employees are satisfactory. 
The Company’s Product Research and Development
The Company’s research and development efforts are intended to maintain leadership positions in core products and provide the Company with a competitive edge as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers. The Company also works with technology development partners, including customers, to develop technological capabilities and new products and applications. Total research and development expenditures, net of recoveries were approximately $295 million, $294 million and $257 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The Company’s Intellectual Property
The Company owns significant intellectual property, including a number of patents, copyrights, proprietary tools and technologies and trade secrets and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Although the Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position, no single patent, copyright, proprietary tool or technology, trade secret or license, or group of related patents, copyrights, proprietary tools or technologies, trade secrets or licenses is, in the opinion of management, of such value to the Company that its business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof. The Company’s general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis, in appropriate countries, on its patentable developments which are considered to have commercial significance.
The Company also views its name and mark as significant to its business as a whole. In addition, the Company holds rights in a number of other trade names and marks applicable to certain of its businesses and products that it views as important to such businesses and products.
The Company’s Raw Materials and Suppliers
Raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products include resins, copper, precious metals, steel and electronics components. All of the materials used are generally available from numerous sources. In general, the Company does not carry inventories of raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. As of December 31, 2016 the Company had not experienced any other significant shortages of raw materials. The Company monitors its supply base and endeavors to work with suppliers and customers to attempt to mitigate the impact of potential material shortages and supply disruptions. While the Company does not anticipate any significant interruption in the supply of raw materials, there can be no assurance that sufficient sources or amounts of all necessary raw materials will be available in the future. 

7

The automotive supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials which have historically placed operational and financial burdens on the entire supply chain. Accordingly, the Company continues to take actions with its customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with customers include collaboration on alternative product designs and material specifications, contractual price escalation clauses and negotiated customer recoveries. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with suppliers include aggregation of purchase requirements to achieve optimal volume benefits, negotiation of cost reductions and identification of more cost competitive suppliers. While these actions are designed to offset the impact of inflationary pressures, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures.
The Company’s International Operations
Financial information about sales and net property by major geographic region can be found in Note 22, Segment Information, included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Report. The attendant risks of the Company’s international operations are primarily related to currency fluctuations, changes in local economic and political conditions, and changes in laws and regulations. The following table presents the Company’s sales and net property and equipment by geographic region as a percentage of such consolidated total amounts. 

 | Sales | | Property and Equipment, Net

Impact of Environmental Regulations on the Company
The Company is subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management. The Company is also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties it presently owns or operates and at third-party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arranged to send hazardous waste. The Company makes capital expenditures in the normal course of business as necessary to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. During 2016, capital expenditures associated with environmental compliance were not material nor did such expenditures have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s earnings or competitive position. 
The Company is aware of contamination at some of its properties. The Company is in various stages of investigation and cleanup at these sites and at December 31, 2016, has recorded a reserve of less than $1 million. However, estimating liabilities for environmental investigation and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond the Company’s control and which may change dramatically. Accordingly, although the Company believes its reserve is adequate based on current information, 
8

the Company cannot provide any assurance that its ultimate environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserve.
