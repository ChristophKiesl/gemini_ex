ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
DuPont was founded in 1802 and was incorporated in Delaware in 1915. Today, DuPont is helping customers find solutions to capitalize on areas of growing global demand — enabling more, safer, nutritious food; creating high-performance, cost-effective and energy efficient materials for a wide range of industries; and increasingly delivering renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. Total worldwide employment at December 31, 2016 was about 46,000 people. The company has operations in about 90 countries worldwide and 61 percent of consolidated net sales are made to customers outside the United States of America (U.S.). See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the location of the company's sales and property.
Subsidiaries and affiliates of DuPont conduct manufacturing, seed production or selling activities and some are distributors of products manufactured by the company. As a science and technology based company, DuPont competes on a variety of factors such as product quality and performance or specifications, continuity of supply, price, customer service and breadth of product line, depending on the characteristics of the particular market involved and the product or service provided. Most products are marketed primarily through the company's sales force, although in some regions, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The company utilizes numerous suppliers as well as internal sources to supply a wide range of raw materials, energy, supplies, services and equipment. To ensure availability, the company maintains multiple sources for fuels and many raw materials, including hydrocarbon feedstocks. Large volume purchases are generally procured under competitively priced supply contracts.
DuPont Dow Merger of Equals 
On December 11, 2015, DuPont and The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals (the Merger Transaction) subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) Dow Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation that was formed on December 9, 2015, as a wholly owned subsidiary of DowDuPont Inc., a company jointly owned by Dow and DuPont, (DowDuPont) will be merged with and into Dow, with Dow surviving as a subsidiary of DowDuPont, (the Dow Merger), and (ii) DuPont Merger Sub, a Delaware corporation that was formed on December 9, 2015 as a wholly owned subsidiary of DowDuPont, will be merged with and into DuPont, with DuPont surviving the merger as a subsidiary of DowDuPont, (the DuPont Merger and, together with the Dow Merger, the Mergers). As a result of the Mergers, among other things, (a) DowDuPont will become the ultimate parent of Dow, DuPont and their respective subsidiaries and (b) existing Dow stockholders and DuPont stockholders will receive DowDuPont common stock, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.  On July 20, 2016, stockholders of both DuPont and Dow voted to approve all stockholder proposals necessary to complete the Merger Transaction at their respective special meetings. Following the consummation of the Merger Transaction, DuPont and Dow intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the Board of Directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company’s agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Intended Business Separations).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock, par value $0.30 per share, of DuPont (DuPont Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), excluding any shares of DuPont Common Stock that are held in treasury, will be converted into the right to receive 1.2820 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of DowDuPont (DowDuPont Common Stock), for each share of DuPont Common Stock with cash in lieu of any fractional share of DowDuPont. Each share of DuPont Preferred Stock-$4.50 Series and DuPont Preferred Stock-$3.50 Series, in each case issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain issued and outstanding and be unaffected by the merger.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of Dow (the Dow Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding any shares of Dow Common Stock that are held in treasury, will be converted into the right to receive one share of DowDuPont Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $1.00 per share, of Dow (the Dow Preferred) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time would be automatically canceled and each holder of shares of Dow Preferred would be deemed to hold the same number of shares of preferred stock of DowDuPont on equivalent terms. However, on December 30, 2016, (the Dow Preferred Conversion Date) each share of Dow Preferred was converted into 24.2010 shares of Dow Common Stock. In connection therewith, on the Dow Preferred Conversion date, Dow issued 96,804,000 shares of Dow Common Stock. As a result, it is expected that no shares of preferred stock of DowDuPont will be issued pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement at the Effective Time.

Spin-off of Performance Chemicals
On July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours). In connection with the separation, the company and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement and a Tax matters Agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), the financial position and results of operations of the Performance Chemicals segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additional details regarding the separation and other related agreements can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Productivity and Cost Savings Initiatives
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them.  In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. The restructuring actions associated with the charge are substantially complete and the plan delivered the target cost reductions in 2016 versus prior year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 24 of this report and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions.  DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. Cost reductions from the 2014 operational redesign were essentially completed during 2015 and for full year 2015, the company delivered incremental cost savings of approximately $440 million year over year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 24 of this report and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business Segments
The company consists of 7 businesses which are aggregated into 6 reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics, the nature of the products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and regulatory environment. The company's reportable segments are Agriculture, Electronics & Communications, Industrial Biosciences, Nutrition & Health, Performance Materials and Protection Solutions. The company includes certain businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as pre-commercial programs, nonaligned businesses and pharmaceuticals in Other. Additional information with respect to business segment results is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 31 of this report and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective January 1, 2016, the DuPont Packaging & Industrial Polymers business consolidated with the DuPont Performance Polymers business within the Performance Materials segment, and the DuPont Protection Technologies business consolidated with the DuPont Building Innovations business within the former Safety & Protection segment (now Protection Solutions). The consolidations were undertaken to create greater efficiency and enhanced capabilities in the two segments where these businesses operate. These changes did not result in a change in reportable segments.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS, continued

DuPont Sustainable Solutions, previously within the company's former Safety & Protection segment (now Protection Solutions), was comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions. Effective January 1, 2016, the clean technologies business unit became part of the Industrial Biosciences segment with the focus on working with customers to improve the performance, productivity and sustainability of their products and processes. The company is exploring a range of options to maximize the growth of the consulting solutions business unit which effective January 1, 2016 is reported within Other. 
Agriculture 
Agriculture businesses, DuPont Pioneer (Pioneer) and DuPont Crop Protection (Crop Protection), leverage the company's technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted area. The segment's businesses deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and to enhance the value of grains and oilseeds through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Agriculture accounted for 57 percent of the company's total research and development expense in 2016. 
Sales of the company's products in this segment are affected by the seasonality of global agriculture markets and weather patterns. Sales and earnings performance in the Agriculture segment are significantly stronger in the first versus second half of the year reflecting the northern hemisphere planting season. As a result of the seasonal nature of its business, Agriculture's inventory is at its highest level at the end of the calendar year and is sold down in the first and second quarters. Trade receivables in the Agriculture segment are at a low point at year-end and increase through the northern hemisphere selling season to peak at the end of the second quarter.
Pioneer is a world leader in developing, producing and marketing hybrid corn seed and soybean seed varieties which improve the productivity and profitability of its customers. Additionally, Pioneer develops, produces and markets canola, sunflower, sorghum, wheat and rice seed, as well as silage inoculants. As the world's population grows and the middle class expands, the need for crops for animal feed, food, biofuels and industrial uses continues to increase. The business competes with other seed and plant biotechnology companies. Pioneer seed sales amounted to 27 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
Pioneer's research and development focuses on integrating high yielding germplasm with value added proprietary and/or licensed native and biotechnology traits with local environment and service expertise. Pioneer uniquely develops integrated products for specific regional application based on local product advancement and testing of the product concepts. Research and development in this arena requires long-term commitment of resources, extensive regulatory efforts and collaborations, partnerships and business arrangements to successfully bring products to market. To protect its investment, the business employs the use of patents covering germplasm and native and biotechnology traits in accordance with country laws. Pioneer holds multiple long-term biotechnology trait licenses from third parties as a normal course of business. The biotechnology traits licensed by Pioneer from third parties are contained in a variety of Pioneer crops, including corn hybrids and soybean varieties. The majority of Pioneer’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these long term licenses. 

Pioneer is actively pursuing the development of innovations for corn hybrids, soybean varieties, and canola, sunflower, wheat and rice seed based on market assessments of the most valuable opportunities. In corn seeds, programs include innovations for insect protection, drought, yield and yield stability. In soybean seeds, programs include products with enhanced end-use value and insect protection. 
Pioneer has seed production facilities located throughout the world. Seed production is performed directly by the business or contracted with independent growers and conditioners. Pioneer's ability to produce seeds primarily depends upon growing conditions and availability of reliable contract growers.
Pioneer markets and sells seed product primarily under the Pioneer® brand but also sells and distributes products utilizing additional brand names. Pioneer promotes its products through multiple marketing channels around the world. In the corn and soybean markets of the U.S. Corn Belt, Pioneer® brand products are sold primarily through a specialized force of independent sales representatives. Outside of North America, Pioneer's products are marketed through a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures and independent producer-distributors.

Backlog
In general, the company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is not material to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Intellectual Property 
As a science and technology based company, DuPont believes that securing intellectual property is an important part of protecting its research. Some DuPont businesses operate in environments in which the availability and protection of intellectual property rights affect competition. Information on the importance of intellectual property rights to Pioneer is included in Item 1 Agriculture business discussion beginning on page 4 of this report. 
Trade secrets are an important element of the company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make DuPont products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the company and/or unjust enrichment. 
Patents & Trademarks: DuPont continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across segments. At December 31, 2016, the company owned about 6,500 active U.S. patents and about 10,000 active patents outside of the U.S., of which about 55 and 30 percent, respectively, relate to the Agriculture segment.
