ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
The Container Store® is the original and leading specialty retailer of storage and organization products and solutions in the United States and the only national retailer solely devoted to the category. We provide a collection of creative, multifunctional and customizable storage and organization solutions that are sold in our stores and online through a high-service, differentiated shopping experience. We feature The Container Store Custom Closets consisting of our elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor, Avera® and Laren® closet lines. Our customers are highly educated, very busy and primarily homeowners with a higher than average household income. Our customers crave discovery, inspiration, and solutions that simplify their lives and maximize their spaces within their homes. Our vision is to deepen our relationship with our customers, expand our reach and strengthen our capabilities, all while championing the enriching benefits of living an organized life. 
We were founded in 1978 in Dallas, Texas as The Container Store, Inc. In 2007, The Container Store, Inc. was sold to The Container Store Group, Inc. In November 2013, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “TCS.” In fiscal 2020, we generated consolidated net sales of $990.1 million. Today our operations consist of two operating segments:

● | The Container Store (“TCS”) consists of our retail stores, website and call center (which includes business sales), as well as our installation services business. We operate 93 stores with an average size of approximately 25,000 square feet (19,000 selling square feet) in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Our stores present our products in a unique and engaging atmosphere. Our visual merchandising team works to ensure that all of our merchandise is appropriately showcased to present solutions to accomplish our customer’s projects, highlight the value and functionality of our products, and maximize the appeal of our image and brand. We maintain a relatively consistent store layout which creates a familiar shopping experience across our store base. Our stores are clean and spacious with orderly merchandising and strategic product solutions to optimize our selling space and increase productivity. We offer our customers their choice of how to shop—in-store, online or through our in-home services. Our stores receive all of our products directly from one of our two distribution centers. Our first distribution center in Coppell, Texas, is co-located with our corporate headquarters and call center, and our second distribution center in Aberdeen, Maryland, became fully operational in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, TCS had net sales of $923.1 million, which represented approximately 93% of our total consolidated net sales.

● | Elfa, The Container Store, Inc.’s wholly owned Swedish subsidiary, Elfa International AB (“Elfa”), designs and manufactures component-based shelving and drawer systems and made-to-measure sliding doors. Elfa was founded in 1948 and is headquartered in Malmö, Sweden. Elfa’s shelving and drawer systems are customizable for any area of the home, including closets, kitchens, offices and garages. Elfa operates three manufacturing facilities with two located in Sweden and one in Poland. The Container Store began selling elfa® products in 1978 and acquired Elfa in 1999. Today our TCS segment is the exclusive distributor of elfa® products in the U.S. and represented approximately 48% of Elfa’s total sales in fiscal 2020. Elfa also sells its products on a wholesale basis to various retailers in approximately 30 countries around the world, with a concentration in the Nordic region of Europe. In fiscal 2020, the Elfa segment had $67.0 million of third party net sales, which represented approximately 7% of our total consolidated net sales.

Management Transition
As previously disclosed, Melissa Reiff retired as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective February 1, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). Satish Malhotra has succeeded Ms. Reiff as President and Chief Executive Officer, as of the Effective Date. Mr. Malhotra was also elected as a Class III director of the Company, as of the Effective Date.
Ms. Reiff will continue to serve as Chairwoman of the Company’s Board until the conclusion of the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2021.
Business Update Related to Coronavirus
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic had a negative impact on the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2020 operations and financial results. We experienced significant disruptions in store operations, including the temporary closure of all stores to in-store customer traffic, which adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also saw a significant increase in website-generated sales, including direct-to-customer shipping as well as our curbside pick-up. Since the second quarter of fiscal 2020, all 93 stores were open with strict health and safety protocols and adherence to local regulations. As a result, website-generated sales during the remaining quarters of fiscal 2020 moderated in comparison to the first quarter as customers began shifting back to purchasing in-store. We will continue to monitor local, state, and federal mandates related to COVID-19, which may require us to adjust our operations in response to revised governmental mandates. The Company has taken actions to tightly manage costs, working capital and capital expenditures to preserve the Company’s financial health during the pandemic.
Our Key Differentiators
The Container Store Custom Closets:
Our focus on The Container Store Custom Closets, full complementary space completion products, and installation services, provides a unique opportunity to drive sales through higher average ticket while differentiating the Company from other brick and mortar and online, items-based retailers. Our highly trained and experienced sales force has been selling proprietary, custom-designed elfa® and other closet solutions for over 42 years. We believe there is no other comparable retailer executing this holistic approach to custom closets. We offer the complete custom closet solution—not just our full line custom closets, but the full array of closet organization products that accompany those closets, as well as a national footprint with millions of customers coming through the door and visiting our online site each year. We design and sell The Container Store Custom Closets in-store, in-home, online, and through our call center.
Our elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor and Avera® closet lines as well as other elfa® products continue to be an ever important, highly profitable and differentiating component in the growth of our Company and reflect our commitment to dominating the custom closet market. In fiscal 2020, all Elfa-produced products accounted for approximately 28% of our TCS retail sales. Due to our vertical integration with Elfa, we have control over the sourcing and availability of elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor, and Avera®, our best selling and highest margin products. We are the exclusive distributor of Elfa-manufactured products in the United States. Approximately 21% of our fiscal 2020 TCS segment purchases were attributed to intercompany purchases from our Elfa segment.
Our Unique Product Collection—Accomplishing Projects in Every Area of the Home:
Our merchandising philosophy is to provide a carefully curated, one-of-a-kind collection of storage and organization solutions for every area of the home, at a variety of price points. We offer over 11,000 products designed to provide customers solutions that simplify their lives and maximize their spaces within their homes. Each year, we introduce approximately 2,000 new SKUs. Our solutions-based selling approach (versus items-based) is delivered by our highly trained salespeople. We believe helping customers accomplish their organizational projects by selling solutions primarily consisting of exclusive, proprietary products differentiates us from other retailers. In fact, in fiscal 2020, over half of our annual sales came from exclusive or proprietary products.

In order to offer our unique collection of products and to execute a competitive merchandising and business strategy, we work to form meaningful, long-lasting relationships with vendors from around the world. We believe these relationships benefit us in a number of ways, including providing us with an increased number of exclusive products and competitive pricing. We believe that by creatively crafting mutually beneficial vendor relationships, we foster a unique sense of loyalty among our more than 650 product vendors. In fact, 18 of our top 20 vendors have been with us for at least 10 years and several of those vendors have been with us since our inception in 1978. For the TCS segment, our top 10 vendors, excluding Elfa, accounted for 38% of our total purchases in fiscal 2020. In order to maximize our purchasing flexibility, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our vendors.

Our Shopping Experience:
We strive to create an Air of Excitement® in each of our stores across the country. You can experience the Air of Excitement® through our employees’ smiling faces and their genuine interest in a customer’s organizational projects and in the bright visual displays of products and solutions.
This is coupled with our highly personalized approach to customer service. Our employees are trained to ask questions to understand our customers’ needs. We believe that if we discover the underlying storage and organization challenges of our customers, we truly help them and hopefully improve the quality of their life. Service and selling are synonymous at The Container Store. We believe we can best serve our customers by astonishing them with personalized service and providing the solutions they most need to accomplish their organizational projects.
We are a multi-channel retailer, with a fully-integrated website, responsive mobile site, and call center to complement our physical stores. Our website, containerstore.com, is intended to replicate the store experience offering virtually the same product assortment and providing real time inventory information for our stores, as well as certain products found exclusively online. We enhance the customer’s experience and deepen loyalty by creating consistent, relevant messages, regardless of which channel is being used. We offer free shipping on orders over $75 and our customers are able to purchase online and pick up at a store, with curbside pick-up in most markets, or request same-day home delivery in select markets. The website, mobile site, and call center sales channels combined accounted for approximately 38% of TCS net sales in fiscal 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a significant increase in our website-generated sales, as our customers are utilizing more time at home as an opportunity to get organized and accomplish home projects.
As previously announced on April 6, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak led to temporary changes in our customers’ shopping experience. During the temporary closure of all stores to in-store traffic in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company shifted to offering contactless curbside pick-up and in-store appointments for a limited number of customers at a time, in select locations and where permitted to offer these services under local regulations. Since the second quarter of fiscal 2020, all 93 stores were open with strict health and safety protocols and adherence to local regulations.
Our Stores:
We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and nationally recognized brand name to successfully develop new stores in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new, existing, small and large markets. Our current footprint of 93 stores extends to 33 states and the District of Columbia. In fiscal 2020, we opened one new store in Richmond, Virginia and closed one store in New York, New York. We expect to open one new store in fiscal 2021, subject to the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and related national, state and local regulations. While our current expansion focus is on domestic markets, we believe international expansion may provide additional growth opportunities for us in the future.
We have a strong base of profitable stores and believe that our expansion opportunities in the United States are significant. We plan to seek out strategic and profitable real estate expansion via a variety of store formats and sizes. In fiscal 2020, our new store in Richmond, Virginia was designed as a reduced-sized footprint store and our anticipated new store in fiscal 2021 is also being designed as a reduced-sized footprint store. Our typical new store opening includes a strategic marketing plan inclusive of public relations and comprehensive training for our store employees that includes product education, solution-selling education, operational education and company culture understanding – all of which we believe enables our new stores to deliver strong sales volume more quickly.

Human Capital Management
Culture
The Container Store has been helping its customers accomplish their projects and solve their organizational challenges for over 42 years, and since 1978 we have been running our business guided by our values-based set of principles. We are proud to be one of the founding companies in a movement called Conscious Capitalism®, which includes a group of like-minded businesses, thought leaders, authors and academics all working together to change the way business is done in America and around the world. We have a firm belief that creating value for and optimizing relationships between all of the stakeholders of our business—employees, customers, vendors, communities and shareholders—is just simply the right thing to do. 
Consistent with our commitment to Conscious Capitalism, we believe that valued and happy employees result in better performance and higher profits. We believe in putting employees first and staying true to our seven Foundation Principles®—simple business philosophies that guide each decision we make. 
You can learn about our Foundation Principles and Conscious Capitalism on our blog, www.whatwestandfor.com. The information contained on our blog is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
The Container Store has built our brand on the conviction that our employees are our top priority. Our culture and commitment to our people are important factors in attracting, retaining, developing and progressing qualified employees. Our retention and engagement strategy is fostered by our investment in and support of our employees on an ongoing basis.
As of April 3, 2021, we had approximately 5,100 employees, of which approximately 4,700 were TCS employees and approximately 400 were Elfa employees. Of the 4,700 TCS employees, approximately 2,900 were part time employees. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company furloughed approximately 2,800 employees, primarily in its stores, as well as a portion of corporate employees, and reduced the base salaries of its executive officers and certain employees, to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. During fiscal 2020, the majority of our furloughed employees returned and as of April 3, 2021, we no longer have furloughed employees and have returned temporarily reduced base salaries to pre-COVID-19 levels.
Talent Attraction, Retention and Development
Our human capital objectives include attracting, training, and retaining highly motivated employees across the Company, from our distribution centers to our stores to our corporate offices. One of our Foundation Principles is 1 Great Person = 3 Good People® in terms of business productivity—that’s our hiring philosophy. In fact, in fiscal 2020, we hired only 10% of job applicants. Our employee first culture includes a tremendous commitment to communication, training and career development that helps deliver a differentiated experience to our customers, which we believe results in a higher average ticket, repeat visits and frequent referrals to other potential customers. We provide extensive formal training to full time store employees, especially during their first year of employment. Our stores offer flexible work schedules and comprehensive benefits. As a result, our full-time employee voluntary turnover rate was approximately 20% on average over the past two years, significantly below the retail average. It is for these reasons that The Container Store was named by FORTUNE Magazine to its annual list of 100 Best Companies to Work For® for 18 consecutive years.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce, our ways of thinking, and our business experiences. As part of our investment in our people, we strive to make diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) a priority. Our goal is to create a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees. By recognizing and celebrating our differences, we aim to cultivate an environment that is inclusive and represents our core values and mission. As a part of this mission, in fiscal 2020, we created and launched our DE&I Task Force to obtain a better understanding of how our Company can improve its practices relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
You can learn more about our DE&I efforts at investor.containerstore.com/corporate-social-responsibility. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Health and Safety
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented strict health and safety protocols across our stores, distribution centers and home office to safeguard our employees and customers. These measures include intensive and frequent scheduled cleaning procedures, adding sanitizing stations in our stores for employees and customers, and providing our in-store employees with face masks and other protective equipment. Precautionary health and sanitization measures, including frequent hand washing and cleaning, employees wearing masks, taking of temperatures before beginning work, installing plexiglass shields at point of sale locations and social distancing are in strict effect in these locations. The Company will continue to monitor the situation and follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local, state, and federal health officials, and intends to reassess or adjust its policies accordingly. 
Sustainability
We have a strong commitment to work towards a sustainable future and believe that the companies best positioned to succeed are committed to growing sustainably, by aligning their mission and business strategy with solutions that benefit customers and their communities. We strive to operate our business in a manner that results in positive impacts to the environment, our communities, our employees, customers, vendors, and shareholders which complements and advances our business priorities. The Board’s role includes overseeing the Company’s corporate strategy and enterprise risk management, including sustainability efforts. Our Board and its committees play a critical role in the oversight of our corporate culture, and hold management accountable for its maintenance of high ethical standards, governance practices and compliance programs to protect our business, employees and reputation.
Our top priorities are to develop policies and efforts that focus on the environment, social responsibility and our employees, respect for human rights and ethics. Our contribution to a sustainable society is to reduce environmental impacts of our products at each stage of development. Our Elfa-manufactured products, which contributed approximately 28% of our fiscal year 2020 retail sales, are largely made from recycled materials and Elfa has a robust sustainability program in place. Additionally, we desire to progress towards a fair, healthy and safe workplace, while creating work environment policies that promote diversity, equality and inclusion. We believe that when we create a workplace where our colleagues are engaged, committed and empowered for the long-term, we are better positioned to create value for our company, as well as for our shareholders. We are proud of our focus on promoting human rights across our operations – from our supply chain to our products – and are committed to build our business on a foundation of ethics.
You can learn more about our commitment to sustainability at investor.containerstore.com/corporate-social-responsibility. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Distribution
In the TCS segment, all of our merchandise flows through one of our two distribution centers prior to transport to our retail stores and/or online customers. Our first distribution center is co-located with our corporate office in Coppell, Texas. The approximately 1.1 million square foot facility was designed and constructed specifically for The 

11



Container Store and is comprised of approximately 100,000 square feet of corporate office space and approximately 1 million square feet of warehouse space. Our second distribution center located in Aberdeen, Maryland became fully operational in fiscal 2019 and is approximately 600,000 square feet, comprised primarily of warehouse space. 
Our distribution centers are utilized for retail store replenishment and direct-to-customer order fulfillment. We utilize third party truckload carriers to transport all of our products to our stores and major parcel carriers for direct-to-customer order deliveries. We utilize best in class logistics technology to optimize operations and current processes for receiving, picking, packing and shipping while providing a strong foundation for future growth. We continue to strengthen our distribution centers with ongoing process and material handling improvements, as well as automation, in order to achieve even greater efficiencies in service levels and inventory management.
Within our distribution operations, we have a culture of safety and efficiency, with a robust metric program and a commitment to continuous improvement. All processes, teams and individuals are held to high efficiency and performance standards. The opening of our second distribution center, in fiscal 2019, improved service levels to our customers while at the same time improving our supply chain and distribution costs. We also continue to invest in supply chain system enhancements for increased logistics network support.
Elfa utilizes a broad network of third-party carriers to deliver products from its manufacturing facilities to customers worldwide.
Our distribution centers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of our temporary store closures and reduced store operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we have seen a significant shift in customer trends from shopping in our stores to purchasing online. The increased online purchasing resulted in delays in order processing, driving an increase in distribution labor needs in both facilities. With employee safety as our #1 priority, our distribution centers follow all recommended guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This includes temperature and symptom checks at the start of all shifts, social distance measures (work area separation), face mask requirements, sanitizing supplies throughout both facilities, scheduled deep cleaning/sanitizing multiple times per week and continuous communication around frequent hand washing. We will continue to follow local, state and federal guidelines to ensure the safety of our employees.


Intellectual Property
Our “The Container Store®,” “Contain Yourself!®,” “Foundation Principles®,” “POP! Perfectly Organized Perks®,” “Laren®,” “Avera®,” “Contained Home®,” and “elfa®” trademarks and certain variations thereon, such as our “The Container Store” logo and many trademarks used for our product lines and sales campaigns are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we own many domain names, including “www.containerstore.com,” “www.whatwestandfor.com” and others that include our trademarks. We own several elfa® utility and design patents protecting Elfa’s closet and shelving systems, and a utility patent for TCS’s proprietary retail shopping computer systems, design patents on select private label products, along with copyrights in our catalogs, websites, and other marketing material. We believe that our trademarks, product designs and copyrighted works have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement.
Competition
We operate within the storage and organization category which extends across many retail segments including custom closets, housewares, and office supplies, among others. However, we are the only national retailer solely devoted to it. Storage and organization products are sold by a variety of retailers, including mass merchants, specialty retail chains, and internet-based retailers, but they devote a smaller portion of their overall merchandise assortment to storage and organization. One of our biggest differentiators is that we sell solutions, not items. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than The Container Store. However, we compete based on our customer service, product selection and quality, price, convenience, consumer marketing and promotional activities, and our ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences, vendor relationships, and brand recognition, among other things. In addition, we believe that the strength of our solutions-based selling with highly 

12



trained employees, exclusive offerings and vendor relationships, our passionate and loyal customer base and the quality, differentiation and breadth of our product assortment compare favorably to those of our competitors.
Seasonality
Our storage and organization product offering makes us less susceptible to holiday season shopping patterns than many retailers. Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of net sales, operating income and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter, attributable primarily to the impact of Our Annual elfa® Sale, which traditionally starts in late December and runs into February. As such, our business has historically realized greater leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses during our fiscal fourth quarter. In fact, over half of our adjusted net income has historically been derived in the fiscal fourth quarter. For more information regarding our use of adjusted net income, and a reconciliation of adjusted net income to the generally accepted accounting principles financial measure of net income, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis”.
Regulation and Legislation
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing truth-in-advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations, environmental and other laws, including tax and trade policies and consumer protection regulations, such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. Any legal or regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers, such as the imposition of potential additional tariffs or retaliatory trade restrictions in connection with U.S. trade actions, could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our vendor compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.
As result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has been monitoring guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local, state, and federal health officials, as well as local, state and federal mandates, and intends to continue to follow recommended mandates and protocols while operating its business.
