ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
GENERAL
Overview and Description of Material Subsidiaries
AEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925. It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries.
The service areas of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers. Restructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.  In Ohio, AEP’s regulated utility operates its distribution and transmission assets while its former generation assets are owned and operated by affiliates.
The member companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in the AEP System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel. The companies of the AEP System also obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider, AEPSC.
As of December 31, 2016, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 17,634 employees. Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has no employees. The material subsidiaries of AEP are:

FINANCING
General
Companies within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs.  Short-term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-term debt.  In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and AEP’s commercial paper program.  Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program.  Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information concerning short-term funding and access to bank lines of credit, commercial paper and capital markets.
AEP’s revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program) include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility, including a maximum debt/capital test.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP’s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements. As of December 31, 2016, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.  With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before 
7

termination of the agreements.  A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information with respect to AEP’s credit agreements.
AEP’s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements, including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS
General
AEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities.  The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are outlined below.
Clean Water Act Requirements
Operations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits, and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants.  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement.  Compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule.  The standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a site-specific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment.  Challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court.
In November 2015, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to update the technology-based standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the Clean Water Act’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.  For additional information, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues.
Coal Ash Regulation
AEP’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum and other materials.  Effective October 2015, the Federal EPA adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units.  The final rule requires certain standards for location, groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule spanning approximately four years after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards, they will be required to close, but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available. For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Coal Combustion Residual Rule.
Clean Air Act Requirements
The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions.  The major CAA programs affecting AEP’s power plants are described below.  The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements. 
8

AEP has made significant long-term investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants. Between 2000 and 2016, AEP invested approximately $8.5 billion in environmental controls, primarily related to CAA, that have significantly reduced emissions. From 2001 and including projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of mercury will be lower by approximately 8,300 pounds, a reduction of approximately 87%. Since 1990 and including projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of SO2 and NOx will be lower by approximately 1,460,000 tons and 560,000 tons, respectively, a reduction of approximately 94% and 89%, respectively.
The Acid Rain Program
The 1990 Amendments to the CAA include a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2 emissions from power plants.  By 2000, the program established a nationwide cap on power plant SO2 emissions of 8.9 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010.  The 1990 Amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce NOx emissions through the use of available combustion controls.
The success of the SO2 cap-and-trade program encouraged the Federal EPA and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs.  AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls, use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets.  Subsequent programs developed by the Federal EPA have imposed more stringent SO2 and NOx emission reduction requirements than the Acid Rain Program on many AEP facilities.  Additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards
The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin.  The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them.  These concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).
Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (nonattainment areas).  Each state must develop a state implementation plan (SIP) to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment areas.  All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval.  If a state fails to develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan.  As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS and establishes new concentration levels, the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new SIPs.  In 2008, the Federal EPA issued revised NAAQS for both ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).  The PM2.5 standard was remanded by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a new rule was signed by the administrator in December 2012 that lowered the annual standard.  A new ozone standard was adopted in 2015.  The Federal EPA also adopted a new short-term standard for SO2 in 2010, a lower standard for NOx in 2010, and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2016.  The existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011.  The states are in the process of developing new SIPs for the SO2, PM2.5 and ozone standards, which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on AEP facilities.
In 2005, the Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which required additional reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from power plants and assists states developing new SIPs to meet the NAAQS.   In August 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to replace CAIR (the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)) that contains more stringent requirements to control SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in 27 states and the District of Columbia.  Petitions for review were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and CSAPR was vacated.  That decision was subsequently reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court and remanded back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for further proceedings. The Federal EPA filed a motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017. The court granted the Federal EPA’s motion, an interim final rule has been issued, and the court has remanded certain state budgets to Federal EPA for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect. Federal EPA has proposed more stringent NOx budgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season. For additional information regarding CSAPR, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.

Hazardous Air Pollutants
As a result of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, the Federal EPA investigated hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to Congress, identifying mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants as warranting further study.  In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emissions from new and modified power plants.  Petitions for review of the MACT standards were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but in 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court determined that Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units. Federal EPA has issued a supplemental finding and the rule remains in effect. For additional information regarding MACT, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.
Regional Haze
The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas (Regional Haze program).  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAA’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.
PSO executed a settlement with the Federal EPA and the State of Oklahoma to comply with Regional Haze program requirements in Oklahoma, and the settlement is now codified in the Oklahoma SIP. PSO is in the process of implementing the requirements of the SIP. Federal EPA has disapproved portions of the Arkansas and Texas SIPs, and finalized a Federal Implementation Plan for Arkansas in 2016.  For additional information regarding CAVR and the Regional Haze program requirements, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.
Climate Change 
AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities. AEP’s total projected CO2 emissions in 2017 (not including emissions from the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek Plants) are approximately 90 million metric tons, a 46% reduction from AEP’s 2000 CO2 emissions of approximately 167 million metric tons. Federal EPA has taken action to regulate CO2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA.  The Federal EPA published the Clean Power Plan in October 2015. Such actions, including the Clean Power Plan, are being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans. The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review. For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate CO2 emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Climate Change, CO2 Regulation and Energy Policy.
Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units.  The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.  Management’s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying AEP’s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas, increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources, where there is regulatory support.
10

AEP’s fossil fuel-fired generating units are large sources of CO2 emissions.  If substantial additional CO2 emission reductions are required, there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.  To the extent additional investments are made to reduce CO2 emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase rates, return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings.  Prudently incurred capital investments made by AEP subsidiaries in rate-regulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment.  Management would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements.  However, requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can have adverse effects because regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that AEP would recover through higher rates. For sales of energy into competitive markets, however, there is no such recovery mechanism.
Renewable Sources of Energy
The states AEP serves, other than Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee, have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy, or renewable energy sources.
At the end of 2016, the AEP operating companies had long-term contracts for 2,630 MWs of wind and 10 MWs of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers. In addition, I&M completed construction of four solar projects that make up I&M’s 14.7 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project (CESPP) that was approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. This resulted in a total of 2,655 MWs of wind and solar in-service serving AEP’s regulated utilities. Management actively manages AEP’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction.
The growth of AEP’s renewable portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both energy and capacity needs. In addition to gradually reducing AEP’s reliance on coal-fueled generating units, the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to maintain a diversity of generation resources. 
The integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by AEP’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect AEP’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbon-constrained world. The Company has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources. Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 9,000 MWs of renewable energy resources of third parties, and AEP’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources.
AEP Energy Supply LLC owns 311 MWs of wind capacity in Texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market. In 2016, AEP took several major steps in executing its strategic plan to develop and market a merchant distributed resource portfolio. AEP Renewables, LLC, was formed in April 2016 to develop and/or acquire large scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with credit worthy counterparties. In 2016, AEP Renewables, LLC brought into service a 26 MW solar project in Utah. The company also owns a 62 MW solar project in Nevada that was brought into service in 2017. 
AEP OnSite Partners, LLC works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities. The company targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers. AEP OnSite Partners, LLC pursues and develops behind the meter projects with credit-worthy customers. As of December 31, 2016, AEP OnSite Partners, LLC owned projects operating in six states, including 15 MWs of installed solar capacity and another 21 MWs of solar projects under construction in five states.
11

End Use Energy Efficiency 
Beginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs.  These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management, were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available.  Since that time, AEP operating companies have implemented over 125 programs across the AEP service territory and in most of the states AEP serves.  For the period 2008 through 2016, these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 6.0 million megawatt hours and peak demand by approximately 2,000 MWs.  AEP estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $1 billion during that period to achieve these levels.   
Energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues, and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments.  As AEP continues to transition to a cleaner, more efficient energy future, energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers.
AEP believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a cost-effective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans.
Corporate Governance
In response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP’s strategic plan, the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coal-fired generation assets. The Board of Directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company.  The Board’s Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees the company’s annual Corporate Accountability Report, which includes information about the company’s environmental, financial and social performance.
Other Environmental Issues and Matters
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites.  See Note 6 to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation for further information.

Environmental Investments
Investments related to improving AEP System plants’ environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the current estimate for 2017 are shown below. These investments include both environmental as well as other related spending. Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market volatility, economic trends and the ability to access capital.  AEP expects to make substantial investments in future years in addition to the amounts set forth below in connection with the modification and addition of facilities at generation plants for environmental quality controls.  Such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2016 or have been proposed and may be adopted.  Future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more onerous. The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws, regulations and rules is expected to be material to the AEP System. AEP typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  For AEP’s merchant generation units however, there is no such recovery mechanism.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEP’s financial condition.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading entitled Environmental Issues and Note 6 to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, for more information regarding environmental expenditures in general.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
AEP’s Reportable Segments
AEP’s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements.
AEP’s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below:
Vertically Integrated Utilities

• | Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.

Transmission and Distribution Utilities

• | Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo and AEP Texas.


• | OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve SSO customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load.


• | With the merger of TCC and TNC into AEP Utilities, Inc. to form AEP Texas, the Transmission and Distribution segment now includes activities related to the former AEP Utilities, Inc. that had been included in Corporate and Other.

AEP Transmission Holdco

• | Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in the State Transcos and Transmission Joint Ventures. These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 

Generation & Marketing

• | Competitive generation in ERCOT and PJM.


• | Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO.


• | Contracted renewable energy investments and management services.

The remainder of AEP’s activities is presented as Corporate and Other. While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent’s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs. With the sale of AEPRO in November 2015, the activities related to the AEP River Operations segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented. See “AEPRO (Corporate and Other)” section of Note 7 for additional information.

VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES
GENERAL
AEP’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.  AEPSC, as agent for AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries.
ELECTRIC GENERATION
Facilities
As of December 31, 2016, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23,000 MWs of domestic generation.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.
Fuel Supply
The following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type (including wind purchase agreements), on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:

 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
Coal and Lignite | 61% | 66% | 69% 
Nuclear | 16% | 16% | 15% 
Natural Gas | 13% | 11% | 10% 
Renewables | 10% | 7% | 6% 

A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels, as well as the addition of renewable resources, may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.  AEP’s overall 2016 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities remained flat on a dollar per MMBtu basis from 2015.
Coal and Lignite
AEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms.  Coal consumption in 2016 decreased from 2015 due to the decreased demand for coal-fired generation resulting from low natural gas prices, and the retirement of Northeastern 4 and Welsh 2 in 2016. Coal inventories ended the year at above-target levels on a system basis.
Management believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units.  Through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls more than 3,722 railcars, approximately 468 barges, 12 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities.
Spot market prices for coal started to strengthen in the second half of 2016. The increased spot coal prices reflect tighter supplies and increased demand for export coal. As of December 31, 2016, slightly less than half of the coal purchased by AEP’s subsidiaries was procured through term contracts.  As those contracts expire or re-open for price adjustments, needed tonnage is replaced at current market prices as necessary.  The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods.  The price paid for coal delivered in 2016 remained relatively flat from the prior year.
15

The following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Total coal delivered to the plants (millions of tons) | 30.0 | | | 37.3 | | | 41.0
Average cost per ton of coal delivered | $ | 45.92 | | | $ | 45.36 | | $ | 46.65

The coal supplies at the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries. As of December 31, 2016, the Vertically Integrated Utilities coal inventory was approximately 42 days of full load burn. While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 30 days.
Natural Gas
The Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed approximately 104 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2016 for generating power. This represents an increase of 16% from 2015. Total gas consumption for the Vertically Integrated Utilities was higher year over year due to lower natural gas prices in the first half of 2016 and the addition of Clinch River, Units 1 and 2 and Big Sandy, Unit 1 as gas retrofitted units during the second quarter of 2016. Several of AEP’s natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal, and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate. AEP’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices.
The following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities.

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Total natural gas delivered to the plants (billion cubic feet) | 103.9 | | | 89.7 | | | 96.1
Average price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas | $ | 2.77 | | | $ | 2.80 | | $ | 4.70

Nuclear
I&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant.  I&M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.  I&M also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel.
For purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel, I&M completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago.  I&M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue.  I&M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis.  I&M completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012, which consisted of 12 casks (32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each).  The second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015, which consisted of 16 casks. The third dry cask loading is expected to occur in 2018.
16

Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning
As the owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely.  The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program.  The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015.  The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $1.6 billion in 2015 non-discounted dollars.  As of December 31, 2016, the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $1.9 billion. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns.  The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the:

• | Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy).


• | Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning.


• | Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies.


• | Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities.


• | Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel.

Accordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections.  AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections.  See Note 6 to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning.
Low-Level Radioactive Waste
The Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the individual states.  Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials.  Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available.  I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However, the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators.  There is currently no set date limiting I&M’s access to either of these facilities.  The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste.  In the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility.
Counterparty Risk Management
The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants. As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31, 2016, counterparties posted approximately $9 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately $57 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information.

The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I&M, dated March 31, 1982, provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant.  Whether or not power is available from AEGCo, I&M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M).  The agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant have expired (currently December 2022) unless extended in specified circumstances.
Pursuant to an assignment between I&M and KPCo, and a unit power agreement between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant.  KPCo has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I&M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I&M for such entitlement.  The KPCo unit power agreement expires in December 2022.
OVEC
AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC.  The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is 43.47%.  Under the Inter-Company Power Agreement, which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each, the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity (approximately 2,400 MWs) in proportion to their respective power participation ratios.  The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo, I&M and OPCo is 43.47%.  The Inter-Company Power Agreement terminates in June 2040. The proceeds from the sale of power by OVEC are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs and to provide a return on its equity capital.  AEP and the other owners have authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests.  OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion in connection with the engineering and construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances, including tax-advantaged debt issuances.  Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls in service.  OPCo attempted to assign its rights and obligations under the Inter-Company Power Agreement to an affiliate as part of its transfer of its generation assets and liabilities in keeping with corporate separation required by Ohio law.  OPCo failed to obtain the consent to assignment from the other owners of OVEC and therefore filed a request with the PUCO seeking authorization to maintain its ownership of OVEC. In December 2013, the PUCO approved OPCo’s request, subject to the condition that energy from the OVEC entitlements are sold into the day-ahead or real-time PJM energy markets, or on a forward basis through a bilateral arrangement. In November 2016, the PUCO approved OPCo’s request to approve a cost-based purchased power agreement (PPA) rider, effective in January 2017, that would initially be based upon OPCo’s contractual entitlement under the Inter-Company Agreement which is approximately 20% of OVEC’s capacity. Some parties filed a rehearing challenge to the PUCO decision which was denied. Separately, OPCo filed a proposal to replace the PPA rider with a bypassable rate mechanism that involves serving non-shopping load with the OVEC contractual entitlement, which remains pending at this time.

ELECTRIC DELIVERY
General
Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Regulation – Rates.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts.  The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and SPP, and as approved by the FERC. See Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Regulation – FERC.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies.
Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.  For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Competition.
Transmission Agreement 
APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA.  OPCo, a subsidiary in AEP’s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment, is also a party to the TA.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM.  The TA has been approved by the FERC.
TCA, OATT, and ERCOT Protocols 
PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA.  Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff.  Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement.  The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT.  These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP.
Regional Transmission Organizations
AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of the SPP (both FERC-approved RTOs).  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.

REGULATION
General
AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions.  AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions.  I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant.  AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of EPACT, much of which is administered by the FERC.
Rates
Historically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  A utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility’s level of investment.  Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative.  Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers.  Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.
Public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management is actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow.  AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process.  These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates.
The rates of AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service).  Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs.  Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.
The following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate.  Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction.  See Note 4 to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters.
Indiana
I&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of-service basis.  Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism.
20

Oklahoma
PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC.  PSO’s rates are set on a cost-of-service basis.  Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatt-hour sales.
Virginia
APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates, currently frozen, approved by the Virginia SCC.  Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause.  In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.
West Virginia
APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.  West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which trues-up to actual expenses.
FERC
Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects.  The FERC regulations require AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and AEP has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at FERC.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.  In addition, the FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by (a) approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and (b) granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices.  AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have market-based rate authority from the FERC, under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, to file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees.
The FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets.  FERC Order 2000 prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable RTO proposals.  AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM.  PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP.
The FERC has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company.  In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.
21

COMPETITION
The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP, like the electric industry generally, face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis, primarily to other public utilities and power marketers.  Federal policy generally fosters competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market and mandates that all generators have equal access to transmission services.  As a result, more generators participate in this market.  The principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price (including fuel costs), reliability of service, and availability of capacity and power.
Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries. AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power. With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position. 
Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive. The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP’s competitiveness. 
While the adoption rate of distributed generation in AEP’s service areas has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country, AEP’s vertically integrated utility companies are focused on providing customers with more choices by working with regulators and policymakers to expand, and potentially accelerate, renewable energy offerings. Such additional customer choices consider not only long-term cost, but are also focused on expanding resource diversity. This includes proposed new revenue structures that enable deployment of advanced technologies and resources. In 2015, AEP formed an Enterprise Technology Council to develop and deploy new programs and services designed to receive regulatory support. The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that the reliability of their service, the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and their ability to cost-effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as solar, on a large scale place them in a favorable competitive position. 
In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. These events could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  AEP typically recovers undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs, each including a return, from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.
Recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the AEP System. Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP work with such customers to meet their business needs. For example, various off-peak or interruptible supply options may be provided pursuant to tariffs filed with, and approved by, the various state commissions. The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP also work with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources. Depending on the jurisdiction, customers may have access to green power tariffs. In other instances, AEP purchases renewable power that is available to all customers in a specific jurisdiction.
22

SEASONALITY
The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP’s results of operations. Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations.
23

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES
GENERAL
This segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo. OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,472,000 retail customers in Ohio.  AEP Texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1,024,000 retail customers through REPs in west, central and southern Texas.
AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for AEP Texas and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies.
AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.
The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.  In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through RTOs also provide transmission services for non-affiliated companies.
Transmission Agreement 
OPCo, together with APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo, is a party to the TA.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the cost of their transmission facilities.  The TA has been approved by the FERC.
Regional Transmission Organizations 
OPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO.  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.  AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT.
REGULATION
OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC.  AEP Texas provides transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules.  Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  The cost of service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility’s level of investment.
24

FERC
Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters.  The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, and it has approved cost-based formula transmission rates on file at FERC.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.
SEASONALITY
The delivery of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP’s transmission and distribution facilities.  In addition, AEP transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  In Texas, and to a lesser extent, in Ohio, unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP’s results of operations.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations.
25

AEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO (AEPTHCO)
GENERAL
AEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the State Transcos and (b) AEP’s Transmission Joint Ventures.
AEPTCo
AEPTCo wholly owns the State Transcos:

• | AEP Appalachian Transmission Company, Inc. (APTCo)


• | AEP Indiana Michigan Transmission Company, Inc. (IMTCo)


• | AEP Kentucky Transmission Company, Inc. (KTCo)


• | AEP Ohio Transmission Company, Inc. (OHTCo)


• | AEP West Virginia Transmission Company, Inc. (WVTCo)


• | AEP Oklahoma Transmission Company, Inc. (OKTCo)


• | AEP Southwestern Transmission Company, Inc. (SWTCo)

The State Transcos are independent of, but respectively overlay, the following of AEP’s existing electric utility operating companies: APCo, I&M, KPCo, KGPCo, OPCo, PSO, SWEPCo, and WPCo. The State Transcos develop, own, operate, and maintain their respective transmission assets. Assets of the State Transcos interconnect to transmission facilities owned by the aforementioned operating companies and unaffiliated transmission owners within the footprints of PJM and SPP. APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, and WVTCo are located within PJM. OKTCo and SWTCo are located within SPP.
IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo, and WVTCo have received all necessary approvals for formation and currently own and operate transmission assets in their respective jurisdictions.  In December 2016, the Virginia SCC and WVPSC granted consent for APCo and APTCo to enter into a joint license agreement that will support APTCo investment in the state of Tennessee. An application for regulatory approval for SWTCo is under consideration in Louisiana.
The State Transcos are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems.  The State Transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with FERC.  The rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed return on equity.  These rates are then included in OATT for SPP and PJM.
The State Transcos own, operate, maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, grid security, safety, reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers, as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets. A key part of AEP’s business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities, assets and components of the existing AEP System as needed to maintain reliability.
The State Transcos provide the capability to replace and upgrade existing facilities. The State Transcos are geographically diverse and have assets in service or under construction across two RTOs and in six states, with additional states planned or pending approval. As of December 31, 2016, the State Transcos had $4.1 billion of transmission assets in-service with plans to construct approximately $ 4.4 billion of additional transmission assets through 2019. Management anticipates the need for extensive additional investment in transmission infrastructure within PJM and SPP to maintain the required level of grid reliability, resiliency, security and efficiency and to address an aging transmission infrastructure. Management also foresees the need to construct additional transmission facilities based on changes in generating resources, such as wind or solar projects, generation additions or retirements, and additional new customer interconnections.  AEP will continue its investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets, and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid. 
26

REGULATION
The State Transcos and the Transmission Joint Ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols.  The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated.
The State Transcos’ and the Transmission Joint Ventures’ (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP.  An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system.  The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis.
The FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with FERC.  The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe.  The formula rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous year’s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner’s ATRR.  PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken.
The formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 11.49% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity for APTCo, IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo and WVTCo.  OKTCo and SWTCo are allowed a return on equity of 11.2% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity. The authorized returns on equity for the State Transcos are commensurate with the FERC-authorized returns on equity in the PJM and SPP OATTs, respectively, for AEP’s utility subsidiaries.
In October 2016, several parties filed a joint complaint with FERC claiming the base return on common equity used by various AEP affiliates in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM OATT is excessive and should be reduced from 10.99% to 8.32%, effective upon the date of the complaint. In November 2016, AEP affiliates filed an application with the FERC to modify the FERC formula transmission rate calculation, including adjustments for certain tax issues and a switch from historic to estimated expenses with a proposed effective date of January 1, 2017. The rates will be implemented based upon the date provided in the pending FERC order, subject to refund.
In the annual rate base filings described above, the State Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $3.2 billion in 2016, $2.3 billion for 2015 and $1.4 billion for 2014.  The total transmission revenue requirement filed in the ATRR, including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges, for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $555 million, $363 million and $231 million, respectively.
The rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT.  ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Costs of Services (TCOS) filings.  ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital. 
Effective March 2017, the Transmission Joint Ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 9.6% to 12.8% based on equity capital structures ranging from 40% to 60%.

GENERATION & MARKETING
GENERAL
The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets, a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business.  The largest subsidiary in the Generation & Marketing segment is AGR.  Through year end 2016 AGR owned 6,752 MWs of generating capacity, with rights to an additional 1,186 MWs pursuant to a unit power agreement (see below).  In January 2017, AGR sold 4,143 MWs of generation capacity to an unaffiliated third party and terminated the 1,186 MW unit power agreement. As a result of the sale, AGR currently owns 2,732 MWs of generating capacity. Other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation & Marketing segment. AGR is a competitive generation subsidiary.
With respect to wholesale energy trading and marketing business, AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries enter into short-term and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM.  These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities.  
These activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices.  These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options.  The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts.  These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.
With respect to the retail supply and energy management business, AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity and/or natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.  AEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C.  AEP Energy also provides demand-side management solutions nationwide.  AEP Energy had approximately 430,000 customer accounts as of December 31, 2016.
AEP Energy Supply LLC owns 311 MWs of wind capacity in Texas and sells its energy entitlement to third parties or liquidates at market. In 2016, AEP took several major steps in executing its strategic plan to develop and market a merchant distributed resource portfolio. AEP Renewables, LLC was formed in April 2016 to develop and/or acquire large scale renewable projects backed with long-term contracts with credit worthy counterparties. In 2016, AEP Renewables, LLC brought into service a 26 MW solar project in Utah. The company also owns a 62 MW solar project in Nevada that was brought into service in 2017. 
AEP OnSite Partners, LLC works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge, innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities. The company targets opportunities in distributed solar, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers. AEP OnSite Partners, LLC pursues and develops behind the meter projects with credit-worthy customers and appropriate agreements. As of December 31, 2016, AEP OnSite Partners, LLC owned projects operating in six states, including 15 MWs of installed solar capacity and another 21 MWs of solar projects under construction in five states.

REGULATION
AGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act, and is subject to FERC’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable.  FERC granted AGR market-based rate authority in December 2013.  FERC’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities (including AGR, which is a public utility as defined by the FERC) and set cost-based rates if FERC subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  Periodically, AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet FERC’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for market-based rates.  Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, review of mergers, and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility.
Specific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including Federal and state environmental protection agencies.  AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for transactions inside ERCOT.  Additionally, AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of FERC. 
COMPETITION
The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary services.  The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Because most of AGR’s remaining generation is coal-fired, lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation.  Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities.
Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment. AGR also competes with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power. 
Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AGR’s competitiveness. The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.
In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. These events could cause AGR to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.
30

Changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the Generation & Marketing segment. Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.  The Generation & Marketing segment works with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options. The Generation & Marketing segment also works with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources.
SEASONALITY
The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change.
Fuel Supply
The following table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Generation & Marketing segment, not including AGR’s ownership of the Oklaunion generating unit:

 | 2016 | 2015
Coal | 62% | 66% 
Natural Gas | 36% | 32% 
Renewables | 2% | 2% 

A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels, as well as the addition of renewable resources, may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.
Coal and Consumables
AGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms.  As contracts expire, they are replaced, as needed, with contracts at market prices. Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements.
Management believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units.  AGR, through its contracts with third party transporters, has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities. AGR plants consumed 10.4 million tons of coal in 2016.
The coal supplies at AGR plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, coal quality, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries. AGR aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn. As of December 31, 2016, the coal inventory of AGR was above target.
Natural Gas
Despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply, the U.S. pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gas-fired generation.  A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements (that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices) supplies natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate. AGR plants consumed 100 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2016, an increase of approximately 8.7% from 2015.
31

Counterparty Risk Management
Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31, 2016, counterparties posted approximately $19 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately $142 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the 2016 Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information.
Certain Power Agreements
As of December 31, 2016, the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 MWs of company-owned domestic wind power facilities, 177 MWs of domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements and 355 MWs of coal-fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers the interest of AEP Texas in the Oklaunion power station to AEP Energy Partners, Inc.  The power obtained from the Oklaunion Power Station is marketed and sold in ERCOT.
