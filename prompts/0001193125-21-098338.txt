Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on February 6, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, completion of our initial public offering (referred to herein as our Initial Public Offering) and the evaluation of possible business combinations, and we have neither engaged in any other operations nor generated any revenues. Based on our business activities to date, the Company is a shell company as defined under the Exchange Act because we have minimal operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash held in a trust account. As discussed further herein, on January 12, 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement with certain entities collectively known as Talkspace, and we refer to our proposed merger with Talkspace throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our Proposed Business Combination. 
 The Company was co-founded by Hudson Executive Capital LP (Hudson Executive Capital), a value-oriented, event-driven investment firm with a focus on, and experience across, the financial services and healthcare sectors, Douglas L. Braunstein, our President and Chairman, and Douglas G. Bergeron, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Braunstein is the Founder and a Managing Partner of Hudson Executive Capital and Mr. Bergeron is a Managing Partner. Hudson Executive Capital, which is a member of our sponsor and is our affiliate, was founded in 2015 and has a successful history investing in undervalued domestic small and mid-cap public companies with identified and actionable opportunities for value creation. Since Hudson Executive Capitals inception, the majority of its employed capital has been focused on financial services and healthcare. 
 Our corporate website address is https://hudsonexecutive.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Potential and current stockholders should not rely on any such information in making any investment decision with respect to our securities. 
 Company History 
 On February 6, 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares of Class B common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class B common stock or founder shares), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.0029 per share. Our Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (Class A common stock), upon the completion of a business combination. On May 20, 2020, our sponsor transferred 25,000 founder shares to Amy Schulman, a director, and on June 3, 2020 our sponsor transferred 25,000 shares to Thelma Duggin, a director, resulting in the sponsor holding an aggregate of 8,575,000 founder shares. On June 8, 2020, we effected a 1:1.2 stock split of our Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 10,350,000 founder shares outstanding of which 10,300,000 were held by our sponsor. The number of founder shares issued 
 
3 


  was based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (collectively, our common stock) upon completion of our Initial Public Offering. 
 On June 11, 2020, we completed our Initial Public Offering of 41,400,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (units), generating gross proceeds of $414,000,000. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (warrant). Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments and conditions. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 10,280,000 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants), each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, or $10,280,000 in the aggregate. An aggregate of $414,000,000 from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the trust account) such that the trust account held $414,000,000 at the time of closing of the Initial Public Offering. 
 On July 28, 2020, we announced that, commencing on July 30, 2020, holders of the units sold in our Initial Public Offering may elect to separately trade the Class A common stock and warrants included in the units. Those units not separated will continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital market (Nasdaq) under the symbol HECCU, and the Class A common stock and warrants that are separated will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbols HECC and HECCW, respectively. We did not issue fractional warrants upon separation of the units. 
 At December 31, 2020, funds held in the trust account consisted solely of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. A portion of interest income on the funds held in the trust account may be released to us to pay tax obligations. 
 Recent Developments 
 Talkspace Merger Agreement 
 On January 12, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) by and among the Company, Tailwind Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (First Merger Sub), Tailwind Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (Second Merger Sub) and GROOP Internet Platform, Inc. (d/b/a Talkspace), a Delaware corporation (Talkspace). 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the Proposed Business Combination) by which, (i) First Merger Sub will merge with and into Talkspace with Talkspace being the surviving corporation in the merger (the First Merger) and (ii) Second Merger Sub will merge with and into the surviving corporation with Second Merger Sub being the surviving entity in the merger (the Second Merger and, together with the First Merger, being collectively referred to as the Mergers and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Transactions and the closing of the Transactions, the Closing). Following the Proposed Business Combination, the Company will change its name to Talkspace, Inc. 
 At the effective time of the Mergers (the Closing Date), all shares of common stock of Talkspace, par value $0.0001 per share (Talkspace common stock), and all vested options exercisable for common stock of Talkspace outstanding as of immediately prior to Closing (Vested Talkspace Options) will be cancelled or assumed, as applicable, and converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holders thereof, a number of shares of common stock of Talkspace, Inc., par value $0.0001 per share (Talkspace, Inc. common stock), (or, with respect to holders of Vested Talkspace Options, a number of Vested Talkspace Options that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the First Effective Time) that will be assumed and converted by virtue of the First Merger into an option to purchase shares of Talkspace, Inc. common stock (Vested HEC Options)) or a combination of shares of Talkspace, Inc. common stock and cash (or, with respect to holders of Vested Talkspace Options, a combination of Vested HEC Options and cash), in each case, as 
 
4 


  adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which in the aggregate with any options to acquire shares of Talkspace common stock granted under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan of Groop Internet Platform, Inc. (Talkspace Options), or portion thereof, to the extent such Talkspace Option (or applicable portion thereof) is outstanding and not vested as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, to be assumed by Talkspace, Inc. and converted into an option to purchase shares of Talkspace, Inc. common stock, will equal the closing merger consideration (the Closing Merger Consideration), reduced by certain deductions for the parties transaction expenses and $72,000,000 (the Sponsor Share Amount). The maximum amount of cash (the Closing Cash Consideration) that may be paid to the pre-closing holders of shares of Talkspace stock and Vested Talkspace Options pursuant to the foregoing is equal to (i) the amount of cash held by us in the trust account (after reduction for the aggregate amount of cash payable in respect of any stockholder redemptions), plus (ii) the amounts received by us upon the consummation of the PIPE Investment (as defined below) and the transactions contemplated under the HEC Forward Purchase Agreement (as defined below), minus (iii) $250,000,000, minus (iv) the transaction expenses of the parties to the Merger Agreement. The maximum number of shares (the Closing Share Consideration) of Talkspace, Inc. common stock that may be issued to the pre-closing holders of Talkspace stock and Talkspace Options (including shares of Talkspaces common stock underlying any Talkspace Options on a net exercise basis) pursuant to the foregoing is equal to a number determined by dividing (a)(i) the Closing Merger Consideration minus (ii) the Closing Cash Consideration, minus (iii) the Sponsor Share Amount, minus (iv) the transaction expenses of the parties to the Merger Agreement, by (b) $10.00. At our election, in certain circumstances the Closing Cash Consideration may be reduced (with a corresponding increase to the Closing Share Consideration) to the extent required to ensure that the business combination qualifies for the intended income tax treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, in no event shall the consideration payable in connection with the Transactions in respect of all outstanding shares of Talkspace stock and Talkspace Options (including shares of Talkspaces common stock underlying any Talkspace Options on a net exercise basis) exceed (i) an amount in cash equal to the Closing Cash Consideration and (ii) a number of shares of Talkspace, Inc. common stock equal to the Closing Share Consideration. 
 The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants of the parties thereto. 
 The Proposed Business Combination is expected to be consummated after receipt of the required approval by our stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approval for listing on Nasdaq of the shares of Talkspace, Inc. common stock. 
 Registration Rights Agreement 
 The Merger Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, Talkspace, Inc., the sponsor and certain former stockholders of Talkspace (the Talkspace Holders) will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, among Talkspace, Inc., our sponsor and certain former stockholders of Talkspace (the Registration Rights Agreement), pursuant to which Talkspace, Inc. will agree to register for resale, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), certain shares of Talkspace, Inc. common stock and other equity securities of Talkspace, Inc. that are held by the parties thereto from time to time. 
Talkspace Holders Support Agreement 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company, Talkspace and certain stockholders of Talkspace (the Requisite Talkspace Stockholders) entered into the Talkspace holders support agreement (the Talkspace Holders Support Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Talkspace Holders Support Agreement, the Requisite Talkspace Stockholders agreed to, among other things, (i) vote to adopt and approve, as soon as reasonably practicable after the registration statement in connection with the registration of Talkspace, Inc. common stock is declared effective and delivered or otherwise made available to the stockholders of the Company and Talkspace, and in any event within forty-eight hours after such registration statement is declared effective and delivered or otherwise made available to the stockholders of the Company and Talkspace,

  the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the Talkspace Holders Support Agreement, and (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and cooperate with other parties, to exercise the drag-along rights pursuant to and in accordance with that certain Sixth Amended and Restated Voting Agreement, dated as of May 15, 2019, by and among Talkspace, the Investors and the Key Holders (as such terms are defined therein). Each of the Requisite Talkspace Stockholders acknowledged and agreed to be bound by the transfers restrictions on its lock-up shares during the period of 180 days after the Closing Date, in each case, subject to limited exceptions as set forth in the proposed bylaws of Talkspace, Inc., effective prior to the First Effective Time and the closing of the PIPE Investment. 
 Sponsor Support Agreement 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we, the sponsor, Douglas Braunstein, Douglas Bergeron, Jonathan Dobres, Robert Greifeld, Amy Schulman and Thelma Duggin (the Insiders) and Talkspace entered into the Sponsor Support Agreement (the Sponsor Support Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Insiders agreed to, among other things, vote to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and the Transactions, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sponsor Support Agreement. Each of the Insiders also agreed to certain transfers restrictions on their lock-up shares during the period of 180 days after the Closing Date, in each case, subject to limited exceptions as contemplated thereby. 
 Subscription Agreements 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into subscription agreements with the investors participating in the PIPE Investment (the PIPE Investors) (collectively, the Subscription Agreements), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 30,000,000 shares of Talkspace, Inc. common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate commitment of $300,000,000 (the PIPE Investment). The closings under the Subscription Agreements will occur substantially concurrently with the Closing, subject to, among other things, the satisfaction of each condition precedent to the Closing set forth in the Merger Agreement, all representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Subscription Agreements being true and correct in all material respects at and as of the Closing Date, satisfaction, performance and compliance by the Company and each PIPE Investor in all material respects with the covenants, agreements and conditions contained therein, and no amendment or modification of, or waiver with respect to the Companys obligation to effect the Closing that would reasonably be expected to materially, adversely and disproportionately, as compared to other PIPE Investors, affect the economic benefits of each PIPE Investor without having received such PIPE Investors prior written consent. Additionally, pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the PIPE Investors agreed to waive any claims that they may have at the Closing or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, the Subscription Agreements against the Company with respect to the trust account. 
HEC Forward Purchase Agreement 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into an amendment to our forward purchase agreement, dated June 8, 2020, between the Company and HEC Master Fund LP (HEC Fund). Pursuant to the First Amendment to the HEC Forward Purchase Agreement, dated January 12, 2021, between the Company and HEC Fund (the HEC Forward Purchase Agreement), HEC Fund agreed to purchase 2,500,000 forward purchase units (the Forward Purchase Units), for $10.00 per unit, or in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the Closing. HEC Fund also agreed to backstop up to $25,000,000 of redemptions by our stockholders. Each Forward Purchase Unit consists of one share of Talkspace, Inc. common stock and one-half of one warrant to purchase one share of Talkspace, Inc. common stock. 
 Talkspace, Inc. 2021 Incentive Reward Plan 
 On January 11, 2021, our Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval, Talkspace, Inc.s 2021 Incentive Award Plan for the purpose of providing a means through which to enhance the ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who make (or are expected to make) important contributions to Talkspace, Inc. by 
 
6 


  providing these individuals with equity ownership opportunities and/or equity-linked compensatory opportunities. Our Board of Directors believes that equity awards are necessary to remain competitive and are essential to recruiting and retaining the highly qualified employees. 
 Talkspace, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 On January 11, 2021, our Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for the purpose of providing a means through which to provide employees of Talkspace and its participating subsidiaries with the opportunity to purchase Talkspace, Inc. common stock at a discount through accumulated payroll deductions during successive offering periods. Our Board of Directors believes that the ESPP enhances employees sense of participation in performance, aligns their interests with those of stockholders, and is a necessary and powerful incentive and retention tool that benefits stockholders. 
Additional Information Regarding Our Proposed Initial Business Combination 
 We have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, and we will file other documents regarding the Transactions. A definitive proxy statement/prospectus will also be sent to our stockholders and Talkspaces stockholders, seeking any required stockholder approvals. We urge stockholders to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, including any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they contain important information about such transactions, including detailed descriptions of the Transactions and a discussion of historical information and risks relating to the Transactions. The documents filed by us with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SECs website at www.sec.gov. 
 Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not reflect that we have entered into the Merger Agreement regarding the Proposed Business Combination or the other agreements described above. 
 Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SECs internet site (http://www.sec.gov) contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. 
 Further, section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not 
 
7 


  had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with certain other public companies difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. We intend to continue to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th or (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. 
 Facilities 
 We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 570 Lexington Avenue, 35th Floor, New York, NY 10022 and maintain other offices as provided to us by our officers. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month aggregate fee an affiliate of our sponsor charges us for general secretarial and administrative services pursuant to an administrative services agreement between us and such affiliate of our sponsor. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the relevant areas, that the fee charged by such affiliate of our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.   Human Capital Resources 
 We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to the Companys matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to its affairs. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
Legal Proceedings 
 On February 10, 2021, two purported shareholders of the Company filed actions against us and the members of our Board of Directors relating to the Mergers. On March 10, 2021, our Board of Directors received a shareholder demand letter against us and members of our Board of Directors. In each case, the shareholders allege a variety of disclosure deficiencies in our preliminary proxy statement/prospectus filed in connection with the Transactions and seek disclosures of additional information. The alleged omissions generally relate to (i) certain financial projections; (ii) certain valuation analyses performed by the Company; and (iii) alleged conflicts of interest. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the forthcoming shareholder vote on the Mergers unless and until we 
 
8 


  disclose the allegedly omitted material information summarized above. The plaintiffs also seek damages and attorneys fees. 
 The Company cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits or demand letter or any others that might be filed subsequent to the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, nor can the Company predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the lawsuits and demand letter. The Company believes that the lawsuits and demand letter are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.
