Item 1. Business.
Overview
Lumber Liquidators (“LL Flooring” or “Company”) is one of North America’s leading specialty retailers of hard-surface flooring, with 410 stores as of December 31, 2020. We seek to offer the best customer experience online and in stores, with more than 400 varieties of hard-surface floors featuring a range of quality styles and on-trend designs. Our online tools also help empower customers to find the right solution for the space they’ve envisioned. Our extensive selection includes water-resistant vinyl plank, solid and engineered hardwood, laminate, bamboo, porcelain tile, and cork, with a wide range of flooring enhancements and accessories to complement. Our stores are staffed with flooring experts who provide advice, pro partnership services and installation options for all of LL Flooring’s products, the majority of which is in stock and ready for delivery. We offer delivery and in-home installation services through third-party independent contractors for customers who purchase our floors. We sell primarily to homeowners or to contractors on behalf of homeowners, as well as to commercial (“Pro”) customers through a network of store locations and online including a new digital platform that has enhanced our customers’ ability to interact with us and our flooring options. We operate as a single business segment, with our customer relationship center, digital platform and customer service network supporting our retail store and online operations.
​
Our vision is to be the customer’s first choice in hard-surface flooring by providing the best experience, from start to finish. We offer a wide selection of high-quality, stocked products and the accessible flooring expertise and service of a local store, with the scale, omni-channel convenience and value of a national chain. We plan to leverage this advantage to differentiate ourselves in the highly fragmented flooring market. We launched our new digital platform, LLFlooring.com, in December 2020. This mobile-friendly site features inspirational content, highlights our digital tools like Picture It!, and Floor Finder and promotes our services such as installation, free flooring samples and delivery. 
We have been revitalizing our brand from Lumber Liquidators to LL Flooring. Customers increasingly begin their flooring journey online. During 2020, we used the LL Flooring brand in conjunction with the Lumber Liquidators brand on our digital platform and on to build awareness. Additionally, we piloted the brand LL Flooring in 20 plus stores during 2020. Based on early feedback, customers who experienced the LL Flooring brand viewed it as more approachable, relevant and of higher quality. We plan to expand the rebranding of our stores in 2021 as part of our long-term brand evolution.
In the second quarter of 2020, we experienced, as did many retailers, a significant disruption to our business due to COVID-19. We demonstrated resilience navigating this disruption to grow sales in the second half of 2020 through progress on our transformation plan that positioned us to capitalize on a robust home improvement spending environment. Trend changes related to COVID-19 are expected to affect 2021 as well and could be impacted by the pace of the roll-out and efficacy of vaccines. 
Lumber Liquidators is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. We were founded in 1994 and our initial public offering was in November 2007. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “LL.” We operate in a holding company structure with Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. serving as our parent company and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Lumber Liquidators, Inc., Lumber

Liquidators Services, LLC, Lumber Liquidators Production, LLC, and Lumber Liquidators Canada, ULC, conducting our operations.
Our Business
Market
According to the July 2020 Issue of Floor Covering Weekly, United States installed floor covering product sales in 2019 were $43.3 billion, not including labor. Within this market, United States hardwood, laminate and vinyl flooring sales accounted for 42% of the total, which is an increase of 3.3% over the same metric for 2018. Flooring sales are driven by a number of factors including discretionary income and trends in the housing market. Including installation, the overall flooring industry has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 4.1% from 2015 through 2019. Over the same period, hardwood, laminate and vinyl flooring sales, including the cost of installation grew at a compound annual growth rate of 7.8%. We believe improvements in the quality and construction of certain products, increasing resiliency and water-tolerance of products, ease of installation, availability in a broad range of retail price points, and movement away from soft surfaces will drive continued hard-surface flooring share gain versus soft surface flooring in the future.
Competition
We compete for customers in a highly fragmented marketplace, where we believe no one retailer has captured more than a 22% share of the consumer market for flooring (including carpet). Although the market includes the national home improvement warehouse chains, national specialty retailers, warehouse clubs and online retailers, we believe nearly half of the industry consists of local one-store flooring retailers, small chains of stores that may specialize in one or two flooring categories, and a limited number of regional chains. 
Customers
We target several distinct customer groups who each have varied needs with respect to their flooring purchases, including do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers, do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) customers, and Pro customers. We believe that each of the customer groups we serve is passionate about their flooring purchase and values our wide assortment of flooring products, availability, and the quality of those products. While our offering to each of these groups begins with the same broad assortment and knowledgeable store associates, each of these customer groups requires unique service components based on the ability of our associates to share detailed product knowledge and preferred installation methods. We offer DIFM customers installation services, while our DIY and Pro customers receive more personal attention when completing their purchase, including dedicated call center resources. All customer groups are offered delivery services.
Products and Services
Product Selection
We offer an extensive assortment of hard-surface flooring under multiple proprietary brand names, led by our flagships, Bellawood® and Coreluxe®. We have invested significant resources developing these national brand names. Our hard-surface flooring products feature a range of quality styles and on-trend designs and are generally differentiated in terms of quality and price based on wood versus manufactured materials, the wood species, grade, and durability of finish. Prefinished floors are the dominant choice for residential customers over unfinished wood planks that have a finish applied after installation. We also offer an assortment of installation services and accessories, including moldings, underlayments, adhesives and tools.
Direct Sourcing
We source directly from mills and other vendors, which enables us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality proprietary products to our customers at a consistently competitive cost. We seek to establish strong, long-term relationships with our vendors around the world. In doing so, we look for vendors that have demonstrated an ability to meet our demanding specifications, our rigorous compliance standards and the capability to provide sustainable and 

5



growing supplies of high-quality, innovative, trend-right products. We source from both domestic and international vendors, and in 2020, approximately 53% of our product was sourced from Asia, 6% was sourced from Europe and Australia, and 6% was sourced from South America. As alternatives have become viable, we have been actively moving our products subject to Section 301 tariffs from China into other, mostly Asian, countries.
Supply Chain
Our supply chain is wholly focused on delivering a complete assortment of products to our customers in an efficient manner. We own a one million square foot distribution center on approximately 100 acres of land in Henrico County, Virginia, which serves the stores located in the easternmost two-thirds of the United States. We operate a 500,000 square foot leased distribution center in Pomona, California as the primary distribution center for the stores located in the westernmost one-third of the United States. A number of our vendors maintain certain inventory levels for shipment directly to our stores or our customers. Our product is generally transported boxed and palletized, and the weight of our product is a key driver of our supply chain costs.
Compliance and Quality Control
Our compliance programs are designed to ensure the products we sell are safe and responsibly sourced, and meet all regulatory and statutory requirements, including, without limitation, requirements associated with the Lacey Act, United States Environment Protection Agency ("EPA") and the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). We utilize a variety of due diligence processes and controls, including supplier audits, periodic on-site visits, and product testing to ensure such compliance. We utilize a risk-based approach to implement and operate the various aspects of our compliance program. Our compliance program considers, among other things, product risk, the level of vertical integration at our suppliers’ mills, legality concerns noted by both private and government parties, and the results of on-site audits that we perform. Our evaluation of sourcing risk is a key component in our allocation of resources to ensure we meet our standards for product compliance and safety. Compliance and Quality Control teams located in the United States and in China are supplemented with external resources that provide independent analyses, which are incorporated into our review processes and monitor our sourcing efforts across all areas from which we source product. Compliance programs and functions are continually under review, updated and enhanced as appropriate to stay current with statutory and regulatory requirements. Our Compliance and Regulatory Affairs Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of our compliance programs.
Additionally, we maintain and operate a 1,500 square foot lab within our distribution center on the east coast. The lab features two temperature and humidity controlled conditioning rooms and two emission chambers correlated to a CARB-approved Third-Party Certifier standard. We believe this equipment mirrors the requirements of CARB and capabilities of other state-of-the-art emission testing facilities. This lab, along with our third-party providers, supports our process to ensure compliance with CARB and EPA requirements.
Installation
Historically one in 10 of our customers purchase professional installation services through us to measure and install our flooring at competitive prices. We offer these services at all of our stores. As of December 31, 2020, we utilized a network of associates to perform certain customer-facing, consultative services and coordinate the installation of our flooring products by third-party independent contractors. Service revenue for installation transactions we control along with freight is included in net services sales, with the corresponding costs in cost of services sold. We believe our greater interaction with the customer and strong relationships with the third-party independent contractors ultimately results in a better customer experience and higher utilization of installation services by the customer.
Store Model
As of December 31, 2020, we operated 410 retail stores. We opened six new stores and closed 15 stores in 2020, including all of our stores in Canada. We are able to adapt a range of existing buildings to our format, from freestanding buildings to strip centers to small shopping centers. Our stores are typically 6,500 to 7,500 square feet. We 

6



enter into short leases, generally for a base term of five to seven years with renewal options, to maximize our real estate flexibility.
We routinely evaluate our store site selection criteria and are currently targeting retail corridors within a market over the more industrial locations we historically sought. We consistently monitor performance of current stores as well as the market opportunity for new locations, adjusting as needed to optimize the profitability and growth potential of our store portfolio. 
Sales Approach
We strive to have an integrated omni-channel sales model that enables our stores, call center, digital platform, and catalogs to work together in a coordinated manner. We believe that due to the average size of the sale and the general infrequency of a flooring purchase, many of our customers conduct extensive research using multiple channels before making a purchase decision. Though our customers utilize a range of these channels in the decision-making process, the final sale is most often completed in the store, working with our flooring experts. Our DIY and DIFM customers typically plan well in advance for the inconvenience of removing old flooring and installing new flooring. Our Pros often have larger, more complex projects, and greater lead time and preparation is often required. Our research indicates that the length of a hard-surface flooring purchase can vary significantly from initial interest to final sale.
Our objective is to help the customer through the entire purchase cycle from inspiration to installation, whether in our store or in their home. Our goal is to provide our customers with everything needed to complete their flooring project – to remove the existing floor, install the new floor with complementary moldings and accessories, and finally, maintain the floor.
Our sales strategy emphasizes customer service by providing superior, convenient, educational tools for our customers to learn about our products and the installation process. We invest in training our store team and virtual sales team members on all of our products and install techniques. Flooring samples for most of the products we offer are available in our stores or can be ordered through our digital platform or contact center. Once an order is placed, customers may choose to either have their purchases delivered to their home or job site, or pick them up at a nearby store location.
We are committed to responding to our customers in a timely manner. Our contact center is staffed by flooring experts cross-trained in sales, customer service and product support. In addition to receiving telephone calls, our contact center associates chat online with visitors to our digital platform, respond to emails from our customers and engage in virtual selling. Customers can contact our Customer Relationship Center to place an order, to make an inquiry, or to order a catalog.
Knowledgeable Salespeople
We believe a large segment of residential homeowners are in need of a trusted expert, whether as a guide through a range of flooring alternatives and services or as a resource to both DIY and DIFM customers. We are deploying robust training programs to train our store management and associates to serve our customers at the highest level. This training focuses on selling techniques and in-depth product knowledge for our store associates, who, we believe, are a key driver in a customer’s purchasing decision.
We place an emphasis on identifying, hiring, and empowering employees who share a passion for our business philosophy where possible. Many of our store managers have previous experience with the home improvement, retail flooring or flooring installation industries. We are also adding regional managers and store managers in training to build our future store leadership.
Digital / Omni-Channel
We launched our new digital platform, LLFlooring.com in December 2020. This mobile-friendly site features inspirational content, showcases our flooring in digital room scenes, highlights our digital tools like Picture It!, and Floor

Finder and promotes our services such as installation, free flooring samples and delivery. Our digital platform contains a broad range of information on our products and services, including a comprehensive knowledge base on all things related to flooring. Customers can also shop from home with a live sales associate in one of our stores through our virtual shopping experience. We also offer extensive product reviews, before and after photos from previous customer projects, style and design trends via the LL Style blog and how-to installation videos. A customer also has the ability to chat live with a flooring expert, either online or over the phone, regarding questions about a flooring purchase or installation. We continue to develop new features and functionality to assist customers, and to ensure they have robust tools at their disposal that are effective at helping them make the ideal flooring choice as they move between other channels.
Advertising and Financing
Advertising: We utilize a mix of digital and traditional media, email and direct mail, to balance product, service and value messaging.   We also utilize advertising to build brand consideration and to educate customers on the flooring category.  Overall, we proactively manage the mix of our media to ensure we efficiently drive sales while effectively building awareness of our brand value proposition. We continue to invest in enhanced digital capabilities. We significantly pulled back our advertising spend in the second quarter of 2020 in reaction to COVID-19 and have re-deployed our spend with an increasing emphasis on digital.
We have been revitalizing our brand from Lumber Liquidators to LL Flooring. Customers increasingly begin their flooring journey online. During 2020, we used the LL Flooring brand in conjunction with the Lumber Liquidators brand on our digital platform and on television to build awareness. Additionally, we piloted the brand LL Flooring in 20 plus stores during 2020. Based on early feedback, customers who experienced the LL Flooring brand viewed it as more approachable, relevant and of higher quality. We plan to expand the rebranding of our stores in 2021 as part of our long-term brand evolution. 
Financing: We offer our residential customers a financing alternative through a proprietary credit card, the Lumber Liquidators credit card, underwritten by a third-party financial institution, generally with no recourse to us. This program serves the dual function of providing financial flexibility to our customers and offering us promotional opportunities featuring deferred interest, which we often combine with product promotions. Our customers may also use their Lumber Liquidators credit card for installation services. We also offer our Pro customers a financing alternative, which is underwritten by a third-party financial institution, generally with no recourse to us. The commercial credit program provides our Pro customers a range of additional services that we believe add flexibility to their businesses.
Human Capital Management
Our people are the core of our business and we commit to deliver them an inclusive, diverse team and culture that understands and adapts to the varying needs of our customers. We seek to provide an engaging work experience that excites and motivate our team members to deliver their best every day. We also aim to provide opportunities for learning and growth, to ensure our team is always the best in the business.
​
We made good progress executing our transformation plan during 2020 to leverage our foundation as a high-touch specialty flooring company and deliver shareholder value. Our transformation plan includes the four strategic pillars of people and culture, improving the customer experience, driving traffic and transactions in our stores and online, and improving profitability. 
​
Our first strategic pillar, people and culture, is a critical driving force behind our transformation plan. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: our Company’s culture and training, the safety and health of our employees; and driving diversity and inclusion.
​
Culture and Training
​
In 2020, we engaged the organization in reviewing the Company’s current mission, vision and values and assessing how well they are serving us today. We formalized our Company’s vision: to be the customer’s first choice in 

8



hard-surface flooring by providing the best experience, from start to finish. We also identified the following six guiding values as the foundation of our culture: 

● | customer obsessed
--+------------------


● | embrace diversity
--+------------------


● | act with integrity
--+-------------------


● | seize opportunities
--+--------------------


● | be resilient
--+-------------


● | own our outcomes
--+-----------------

​
During 2020 we added more regional and store managers in training to build our bench of future store leadership. Our field leadership has also focused on developing a more robust store and regional manager training program that promotes both diverse and inclusive leadership as well as drive greater internal career advancement.
​
Safety and Health 
​
Our commitment to the safety of our associates is an essential and ongoing part of our business. We require careful attention to safety with respect to handling product in our warehouses, stores, installation and delivery processes. During COVID-19 we prioritized the safety of our associates and customers and followed rigorous standards for mask wearing, social distance and cleaning protocols. We have implemented remote work for all corporate support associates including senior management. We have significantly reduced travel and contact to help protect not only our associates but also the communities in which we live. We also provided emergency relief pay to our associates affected by COVID-19 exposure or related facility closures. 
 ​
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
​
As part of our multi-year business transformation, we are working on driving diversity, equity and inclusion across our Company. This commitment will be supported by training and awareness programs as well as focused efforts to recruit, retain, develop and promote a diverse workforce. In 2020, we formed a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Taskforce, comprised of a cross-functional team of associates, to begin this important work. This team has been discussing the Company’s culture survey results, sharing ideas on what diversity, equity and inclusion should look like in our Company, formulating goals and establishing priorities for 2021 and beyond. We are also working with external consultants to connect our work with best practices and insights related to diversity, equity and inclusion. 
​
Employees 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,230 employees, 95% of whom were full-time and none of whom were represented by a union. Of these employees, 72% work in our stores, 19% work in corporate store support infrastructure or similar functions (including our call center employees) and 9% work in one of our distribution centers. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
​
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
Our quarterly results of operations can fluctuate depending on the timing of our advertising and the timing of, and income contributed by, our new stores. Our net sales fluctuate slightly as a result of seasonal factors, and we adjust merchandise inventories in anticipation of those factors, causing variations in our build of merchandise inventories. Generally, we experience higher-than-average net sales in the spring and fall, when more home remodeling activities typically are taking place, and lower-than-average net sales in the colder winter months and during the hottest summer months. Our 2020 results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and starting at the of March 2020 the Company closed as many as 56 stores for a period of time while all other stores operated under reduced hours and/or warehouse only conditions, offering curbside pickup and job site delivery for our Pro and DIY customers. The unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on the first half of 2020 was largely offset by favorable sales growth in the second half of 2020.
