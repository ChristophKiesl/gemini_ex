ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
The Company
 
Webstar Technology Group, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Wyoming on March 10, 2015. The Company was established for the operation of certain licensed and purchased software solutions. Since inception, the Company signed two license agreements with a related party to license proprietary software technology solutions, i.e., Gigabyte Slayer and WARP-G. The Company has been focused in large part on organizational activities and the development of its business plans to license the Gigabyte Slayer software application that is designed to deliver live video streams, video downloads and large data files more efficiently by using new proprietary data compression technology and to license the WARP-G software solution that is designed to enable enterprise customers that transmit live video streams, video downloads and large data files to push such data over existing pipelines at higher speeds in less time also by using new proprietary data compression technology. Further, the Company purchased the intellectual property rights for the Webstar eCampus virtual classroom access platform from a related party. The Company completed the license of Gigabyte Slayer and WARP-G software on April 21, 2020 and is now implementing the marketing plan to sub-license the software.

Recent Developments
 
Series A Preferred Stock
 
On March 16, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations (the “Certificate”) with the Secretary of State of Wyoming to amend its Articles of Incorporation to designate the Series A Preferred Stock as a series of preferred stock of the Company. 1,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are authorized in the Certificate. The Series A Preferred Stock has voting rights equivalent to three times the total voting power of the total common stock outstanding at any time. The Series A Preferred Stock has no transfer rights, no conversion rights, no dividends, and no liquidation preference. On April 2, 2020, the Company issued James Owens all 1,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock in settlement of $250,000 of amounts due to Mr. Owens. The estimated fair value of the Series A Preferred Stock was determined to be less than the $250,000 based on the estimated calculated value of the control premium using the implied value of the Company based on a recent offering of the Company’s common stock. The total price of $250,000 was recorded as a reduction to the due to stockholder account and an increase to the additional paid-in capital due to the related party nature of the transaction.
Common Stock
 
On April 21, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a common stock dividend to issue each holder of the Company’s common stock a common stock dividend of .218723 shares per share of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
 
On April 21, 2020, the Company issued 25,000,000 shares of its common stock to the Company’s common stockholders of record per the common stock dividend declaration.

Our Planned Products and Services and Operation of Webstar eCampus
 
Gigabyte Slayer Software
 
Gigabyte Slayer is a distinct mobile application created to enable users to transmit more data over existing data streams to optimize data usage across mobile devices including smartphones and tablets. The application is designed to eliminate video streaming delays and reduce customers’ data plan bandwidth usage from any 3G or 4G LTE cell phone network provider. The application is designed to deliver live video streams, video downloads and large data files more efficiently by using new proprietary data compression technology. This technology significantly reduces the data package size and enhances the data traffic control between cell phone provider data downloads and uploads to customers’ mobile devices.
 
Web browsers perform various levels of caching data, the practice of storing data in and retrieving data from a memory device. Unfortunately, many use unsophisticated cache control capabilities. In comparison, Gigabyte Slayer data compression is capable of optimizing the high bandwidth downloads and returns the data to users’ mobile devices. This process is expected to dramatically reduce the data bandwidth needed when watching online videos, playing online games, or simply downloading large data files. The service is targeted to enter the mobile device market by offering application downloads with a monthly service fee. A smartphone and tablet user utilizing the Gigabyte Slayer application is expected to be able to decrease their data usage on their current data plan, at no additional cost, from their cell phone provider. Further, Gigabyte Slayer is designed to eliminate downloads “buffering” currently experienced by many current applications.
 
WARP-G Software
 
WARP-G is a business to business software solution that companies can use on an enterprise wide basis to transmit more data over existing data streams to optimize their data usage. The software is designed to enable enterprise users to deliver faster data streams, experience shorter download/upload times and increase the volume and speed of the data. The software is designed to create less congestion and increase the speed of packets being delivered more efficiently by using new proprietary data compression technology. This technology is expected to allow the enterprise users to push more data through existing pipelines meeting increasing consumer video demands and other large files.
 
Webstar eCampus
 
Webstar eCampus is an affordable, virtual online education and e-learning technology that allows the possibility of almost any organization to offer educational services online. Following completion of the license of the Gigabyte Slayer software, we plan to enhance the Webstar eCampus virtual classroom access platform by incorporating the Gigabyte Slayer data technology which is designed to securely deliver all content at greater efficiency and significantly increase storage capabilities. This enhancement is expected to enable universities and other educational institutions to increase student participation and convenience with an enhanced experience for the students. Students will no longer experience delays in data transmission or “buffering” that is experienced by other online e-learning solutions. Webstar eCampus makes it possible for educators to offer their students visual online access to classroom activities from anywhere in the world. Remote students who use the service will be able to virtually access their classroom via the internet using their web enabled Smartphone, device or computer. The Webstar eCampus software is currently in use by California College of Early Childhood Development (the “California College”) pursuant to an oral agreement. Under the terms of the oral agreement, the California College has agreed to pay us an annual non-refundable license fee of $995 plus $195 per classroom, and $49.95 per student per class. Either party may terminate this use right at any time during its month-to-month term. Currently we are dependent on California College for our revenue as they are our only customer at this time.

g) | Global marketplace issues to be addressed by our Software solutions: (1) Cyber-security - Protecting information, identity and data for both individuals as well as businesses is a huge global issue, (2) Lost connections, buffering delays, bandwidth limitations. Slow downloads/uploads costs time, money, and builds frustration with digital and mobile users, (3) Rising costs of data dig deep into corporate margins, (4) Data plan limitations in storage and speed limit individuals’ mobile usage capabilities, (5) Rising costs of personal and family data plans, (6) Impending “Utilization” of data by cable companies will significantly increase costs. 

Growth Strategy
 
Our primary financing need is focused on funding the licensing arrangements for the proprietary software products and services we acquired and plan to acquire, providing the proper support for such products, building our core of experienced and capable leadership team, and developing our corporate branding and go-to-market strategy.
 
Our core objective is to build the Webstar brand as a premier provider of Software as a Service (SaaS) in the Software Technology industry with the ability to enhance any and all industries by specializing in the optimization of data delivery through our propriety data compression, security solutions, artificial intelligence, and virtual online learning services.
 
Our primary means of building our brand is expected to be accomplished by consistently providing proprietary, disruptive products that possess mass-market appeal and fulfill significant market demand. Our goals include developing global partnerships with leading companies; delivering high quality, value-added services to our business partners and customers; and leveraging opportunities to align with complimentary cutting-edge technologies. In addition, we will have ongoing marketing efforts that reinforce the Webstar brand, its key market positions, and its core value propositions. We have developed effective business strategies to achieve these objectives.
 
As an emerging growth company, in addition to our current software license, we plan to secure the exclusive right to market, sell, and license all apps, software, products, and services developed by Soft Tech. While initial efforts focus primarily on marketing, selling and licensing the Gigabyte Slayer and Warp-G software, in the future we may also acquire similar rights to apps, software, and products compatible with our mission created by companies other than Soft Tech.

We believe the software applications we have licensed and acquired and the services we currently provide and plan to provide will be viewed as revolutionary technologies, which will embrace disruptive paradigm shifts in the cable and data delivery business markets, and will fulfill significant worldwide demand. We expect both retail and commercial demand for our products and services will be high due to the significant growth of and demand for mobile devices, smart devices (such as smart TVs), and other data delivery devices as an integral part of business operations and infrastructure as well as a vital, growing part of everyday life. The software we have licensed and acquired and the services we currently offer and plan to offer have been developed with this in mind and will position us to provide key solutions to increase data access and reduce costs for data network providers as well as their customers. The eCampus software includes uniquely innovative virtual online learning solutions for educators and academic institutions. We believe that our plan to be first-to-market and by establishing disruptive best-in-class products and services will lead to high-market demand— enabling us to become, and remain, a leader in the industry.
 
Our plan for growth includes:
 

● | Pursuit and development of organic growth through the expansion of our planned products and services as well as through strategic partnerships and potential acquisitions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Commitment to hiring best-in-class executive management, technical support professionals, customer service experts and consultants. 
● | Begin eCampus’ penetration into U. S. post-secondary and K-12 markets. 
● | Expand eCampus technology into other complementary industries including but not limited to virtual events, online corporate training and certification, virtual shopping, and virtual sporting events. 
● | Expansion of the data compression product, Gigabyte Slayer to the public, eventually into global markets through individual user sales and corporate business licensing contracts. 
● | Expansion of the enterprise solution, WARP-G technology into all industries across global markets through corporate business licensing contracts. 
● | Implementation and management of state-of-the-art network data centers for effective and efficient technology operations and customer support. 
● | Negotiation of international licensing and partnerships for data delivery technology and virtual platform solutions with key strategic global corporations and institutions. 

 
Global Paradigm Shift: The “Utilization” of Data – We believe that Webstar is uniquely positioned to pioneer innovative and effective data delivery software solutions to the cable industry as it encounters a significant paradigm shift towards the “utilization” of data. As cable companies continue to lose market share of their cable TV business to direct TV services and streaming video companies, the core of their business will increasingly focus on charging customers for usage of the data running through the pipelines they control—similar to how electric and water companies meter and charge customers for monthly usage. We believe that it is inevitable that cable companies may charge customers for data usage as a monthly utility charge as the cost of data transmission increases.
 

● | We expect demand for our services to increase and revenues and profits to grow accordingly from corporate and academic institution licensing and retail sales, as well as international sales. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe the development of future products and services that complement and expand our planned portfolio of offerings will grow revenue and profits. 
● | We plan to enter into an exclusive agreement with Soft Tech to create and develop additional disruptive software and technologies in the data delivery, artificial intelligence, and virtual online learning industry sectors.

Competition
 
Our competitive landscape includes a variety of software products and service businesses offering telecommunications and data delivery as well as technology business consulting services. The market for these products and services is highly competitive. It is also highly fragmented, with many providers and no single competitor maintaining a clear market leadership position. Our competition will vary by location, type of service provided, and the type of customers to whom services are provided. Our competitors will include: (i) large national or international technology service firms; (ii) regional specialty firms; (iii) software/hardware vendors and resellers; (iv) other software solution developers and providers and (v) internal staff of our customers and potential customers, among others. These companies may already have an established market in our industry. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products and services longer than we have been developing ours. Additionally, there are not significant barriers to entry in our industry and new companies may be created that will compete with us as well as other, more established companies who do not now directly compete with us, may choose to enter our markets and become new competitors.
 
The eCampus product also faces varying degrees of competition from a variety of education companies because the learning system encompasses many components of the educational development and delivery process. We will compete primarily with companies that provide online curriculum and school support services. These companies include Advanced Academics (DeVry, Inc.), Connections Academy, LLC (recently announced to be acquired by Pearson PLC), White Hat Management, LLC, and National Network of Digital Schools Management Foundation Inc., among others. We will also face competition from online and print curriculum developers. These companies may already have an established market in that industry. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products and services longer than we have currently.
 
Research & Development
 
We plan to rely on our related-party relationship with Soft Tech for product development and software engineering and consulting services for the maintenance, development and support of the Webstar eCampus platform and the Gigabyte Slayer and WARP-G software solutions. Based on the availability of our working capital, we intend to commit significant resources to product research and development to ensure that we can offer a viable and marketable virtual classroom access platform, data compression software application as well as other software applications expected to be released. To date the Company has not incurred research and development expenses.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, as well as confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights.
 
The Company is seeking to register the following trademarks “Gigabyte Slayer”, “Warp-G”, and “Warp-G Mobile” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”).

We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
 
We also have copyright protection for the content on our website www.webstarecampus.com. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this report.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and internationally, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business.
 
In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of our users’ personal information and related data. We will post our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy on our website where we set forth our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of customer data. Our failure to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could damage our reputation and business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws and their application to the Internet is evolving and not settled. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner by various states, countries and areas of the world where our users are located, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying national and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely impact our business.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this report we have three full-time employees. We currently rely on our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don D. Roberts, our Chief Financial Officer, Harold E. Hutchins, and our Chief Technology Officer, James Owens to manage all aspects of our business. All of our executive officers are engaged by the company under employment agreements and provide services on an as needed basis as agreed to between us and the executive. The salaries of the CEO and CTO are not currently being paid but are being accrued. The CFO’s salary is also being accrued but a portion is being offset by amounts currently being paid to him... Upon the Company having secured sufficient funds to support its continued business operations, all executive officers of the Company will be obligated to devote their full working time and attention to the business and affairs of the Company for the remaining term of their employment agreements. We intend to hire additional employees on an as-needed basis as our business expands.

Legal Proceedings
 
We know of no existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
Properties
 
Our principal offices are located at 4231 Walnut Bend, Jacksonville, FL 32257. Our telephone number is 1.888.405.7860. These offices are provided free of charge by Mr. Owens until such time as sufficient funds have been raised to support the business operations. At that time, a lease arrangement will be made.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
