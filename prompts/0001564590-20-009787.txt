Overview 
 ChemoCentryx is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new medications targeted at inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Each of our drug candidates is designed to selectively block a specific chemoattractant receptor, leaving the rest of the immune system intact. Our drug candidates are small molecules, which are orally administered, and, if approved, could address unmet medical needs, including improved efficacy, and offer significant quality of life benefits, since patients swallow a capsule or pill instead of having to visit a clinic for an infusion or undergo an injection.
 In November 2019, we announced positive topline data from the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of avacopan, our lead drug candidate that is an orally-administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, or ANCA vasculitis. The ADVOCATE trial compared avacopan with the currently used glucocorticoid (most commonly prednisone) active comparator containing standard of care, or SOC. Subjects in both study arms received background therapy with rituximab or cyclophosphamide. The trial met both of its primary endpoints, showing that avacopan therapy without the need for daily prednisone could achieve disease remission at 26 weeks and sustained remission at 52 weeks, as assessed by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS. BVAS remission at week 26 in the avacopan treated subjects was numerically superior and statistically non-inferior to the prednisone active comparator SOC control group, where BVAS remission was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to prednisone active comparator SOC (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). Reduction in overall burden of disease management and improvement in quality of life was also demonstrated through key secondary endpoints, including improved kidney function and reduction of adverse events and illnesses associated with steroids, such as prednisone.
 We plan to file a New Drug Application, or NDA, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in mid-2020 and, if the NDA is approved, to commercialize avacopan in the United States on our own and internationally through our kidney health alliance with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. and its affiliates and sublicensees, or collectively, Vifor. We are also developing avacopan in other indications, including complement 3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, and hidradenitis suppurativa, or HS. 
 Our next most advanced drug candidate is CCX140, an orally-administered inhibitor of the C-C chemokine receptor known as CCR2. CCX140 is being developed for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, a rare renal disease characterized by progressive proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) and impaired renal function. We have two ongoing Phase II clinical trials to evaluate CCX140 for the treatment of primary or genetic FSGS, the LUMINA trials, with the LUMINA-1 trial for patients with sub-nephrotic proteinuria, and the LUMINA-2 trial for patients with nephrotic syndrome, for which there are currently no FDA-approved treatments. We expect to report topline data from the LUMINA-1 trial in the second quarter of 2020 and the LUMINA-2 trial in the second half of 2020. 
 Our Strategy
 The key elements to our commercial and scientific strategy are to:
  
• | Obtain regulatory approval of avacopan for the treatment of ANCA vasculitis. In the United States, we are currently preparing an NDA for avacopan, which we plan to file with the FDA in mid-2020. We will also support our international commercialization partner Vifor and its Japanese sublicensee Kissei Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd. in their regulatory approval applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize avacopan in the United States on our own, where we believe a company of our size can effectively compete in rare disease markets. If our avacopan NDA is approved by the FDA, we plan to deploy a specialty sales force primarily targeting that subset of nephrologists and rheumatologists treating ANCA vasculitis patients;

 Product Development Programs
 Our product development portfolio features multiple novel, targeted drug candidates in the therapeutic areas of immunology, oncology and immuno-oncology. 
 We have chosen to focus initially on orphan indications, where drug candidates tend to enjoy a faster path to market and better reimbursement. Our leading drug candidates, avacopan and CCX140, address areas of clear unmet need in kidney and dermatological disease, where the current SOC is insufficient to halt progression of the disease and/or where today’s treatment options come with serious side effects, such as those which accompany the prolonged use of steroids. 
 While we have focused initially on kidney and dermatological diseases, our target-specific and selective approach designed to stop the spread of inflammatory disease-inducing cells shows promise in other disease areas. Over time we plan to bring forward drug candidates to treat a range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, as well as cancer. We expect that our ability to do so will grow as we increase our scale and to the extent that we start to earn revenues and royalties from the commercialization of our late stage kidney disease franchise.
 Our Drug Candidate Pipeline 
 

Avacopan (CCX168) – Inhibition of Complement-Mediated Pathways in Orphan Diseases
 The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to regulate aspects of host defense against bacteria and viruses, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. The complement system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body’s healthy cells. In certain autoimmune diseases (including those in which we are engaged in clinical trials), components of the complement system have become dysregulated. 
 In our complement inhibition orphan disease program, our lead drug candidate is avacopan. Avacopan is a potential first-in-class, orally-administered molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in the treatment of ANCA vasculitis and other complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Avacopan precisely blocks a specific receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils. Avacopan thereby arrests the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA vasculitis and other complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Current therapies for such diseases typically include broad immunosuppression with high doses of glucocorticoids (steroids) such as prednisone or methylprednisone, which may cause significant illness and even death. Avacopan therapy was designed to prevent these outcomes. Avacopan does not affect formation of the C5b-9 terminal complement complex, or MAC, unlike the anti-C5-antibody, eculizumab (Soliris®). Therefore, we believe avacopan does not increase the susceptibility to infections for which

 MAC is important in host defense. Moreover, there are two distinct receptors for C5a: the pro-inflammatory C5a receptor known as C5aR, the target of avacopan, and the anti-inflammatory C5a-like receptor, or C5L2, which plays an important role in homeostasis. Accordingly, precisely inhibiting C5a at the level of C5aR is thought to block the pro-inflammatory effects of C5a, while leaving the protective effects of C5L2 functional. Avacopan does not bind into C5L2, thereby not interfering with the protective effects of C5L2.
 We have successfully completed and reported positive clinical data from our pivotal Phase III clinical trial known as ADVOCATE in ANCA vasculitis, and we are currently evaluating avacopan in Phase II clinical studies for the treatment of C3G and HS.
 ANCA Vasculitis 
 ANCA vasculitis is an orphan, severe, and often fatal autoimmune disease that is characterized by elevated levels of autoantibodies called anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies and by inflammation that can affect many different organ systems, and commonly involves the kidneys. ANCA vasculitis affects approximately 40,000 to 75,000 people in the United States, with approximately 4,000 new cases each year; similarly, ANCA vasculitis affects approximately 50,000 to 100,000 people in Europe, with approximately 5,000 new cases each year.
 ANCA vasculitis is currently treated with courses of immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide, or CYC, or rituximab, or RTX) combined with high-dose prednisone administration. Complete remission is achieved in only 60-80% of patients and relapse is common. Following initial treatment, up to 30% of patients relapse within six to 18 months, and up to 50% of patients relapse within three to five years.
 The current SOC for ANCA vasculitis is associated with significant safety risks due to general immunosuppression including increased infection rates and dose-related increases in hematological and solid organ malignancies, as well as metabolic and other toxicities associated with glucocorticoids. First year mortality is approximately 11% to 18%, with the single greatest cause of this premature mortality being not disease related, but rather infection and other side effects that are thought largely to be a consequence of prednisone administration. The multiple adverse effects of acute and chronic prednisone treatment often required in the treatment plan are major causes of both short-term and long-term morbidity including the increased infection risk. Glucocorticoid therapy-related adverse events contribute significantly to patient care costs, as well as to the diminution of quality of life for patients.
 Role of C5a and C5aR in ANCA Vasculitis 
 Complement 5a, or C5a, acting through its receptor C5aR, sometimes called C5aR1 or CD88, is thought to play a pro-inflammatory role in ANCA vasculitis. Autoantibodies against neutrophil enzymes lead to the priming and activation of neutrophils and activation of the complement cascade. Activation of the complement cascade leads to production of C5a, one of the most potent pro-inflammatory mediators of the complement system. C5a, through binding to its receptor C5aR, induces expression of adhesion molecules and chemotactic migration of neutrophils and other white blood cells. These accumulating adhering neutrophils initiate an inflammatory cascade in the small blood vessels by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemoattractants that lead to necrotizing vasculitis.
 Avacopan Phase III Clinical Trial in ANCA Vasculitis
 We have successfully completed and reported positive topline clinical data from our pivotal Phase III clinical trial of avacopan for the treatment of ANCA vasculitis, known as the ADVOCATE trial. ADVOCATE was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled worldwide clinical trial which enrolled 331 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing ANCA vasculitis at over 200 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The aim of the trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of avacopan in inducing and sustaining remission in patients with ANCA vasculitis. The study included two treatment arms: the test arm contained 30 mg twice-daily oral doses of avacopan and eliminated prednisone, and the prednisone active comparator control arm contained an avacopan-matching placebo and maintained a standard regimen of high-dose chronic prednisone. All patients also received a standard background immunosuppressant, either CYC followed by azathioprine or RTX. 
 The ADVOCATE study met both of its primary endpoints, disease remission at 26 weeks and sustained remission at 52 weeks, as assessed by BVAS. Remission was defined as a BVAS score of zero and being off prednisone treatment for ANCA vasculitis for at least the preceding four weeks.

Index to Financial Statements
 The pre-specified primary endpoints were remission of acute vasculitis activity at week 26 and sustained remission at week 52, where avacopan therapy was at least statistically non-inferior to the prednisone active comparator SOC. The two primary endpoints were tested sequentially using a gatekeeping procedure to preserve the Type I error.
 BVAS remission at week 26 was achieved in 72.3% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 70.1% of subjects in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority). Sustained remission at 52 weeks was observed in 65.7% of the avacopan treated subjects vs. 54.9% in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group, achieving both non-inferiority and superiority to prednisone active comparator SOC (p=0.0066 for superiority of avacopan). 
 Subjects who received avacopan experienced additional benefits compared to those in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group. These benefits, assessed as pre-specified secondary endpoints, include:
 1. Significant reduction in glucocorticoid-related toxicity
  
• | In the Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI version 2), the avacopan therapy arm vs. the prednisone active comparator SOC control group was statistically significantly improved for:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The GTI Aggregate Improvement Score: avacopan therapy 11.2 vs. 23.4 for prednisone active comparator SOC (p=0.0082 for avacopan superiority).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other measures of glucocorticoid-related adverse event assessments (i.e., those based on European League Against Rheumatism-recommended adverse event terms and those based on Investigator Assessment of causality) also showed statistically significantly fewer events in the avacopan therapy arm vs. the prednisone active comparator SOC control group.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. Significant improvement in kidney function in patients with renal disease
  
• | The avacopan group exhibited a statistically significant improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, from baseline to week 26 and to week 52 compared to the prednisone active comparator SOC control group:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Mean change from baseline to week 26 in eGFR: avacopan treated subjects had an increase of 5.8 mL/min/1.732 vs. an increase of 2.8 mL/min/1.732 in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group (p=0.0413).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Mean change from baseline to week 52 in eGFR: avacopan treated subjects had an increase of 7.3 mL/min/1.732 vs. an increase in eGFR of 4.0 mL/min/1.732 in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group (p=0.0259).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Marked improvement in kidney function particularly in patients with a baseline eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Those patients showed a mean improvement of 14 units at week 52 which was highly statistically significant (p < 0.01).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3. Improvements in health-related quality of life metrics
  
• | The avacopan group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the majority of domains measured by the validated quality of life instrument SF-36 version 2 at week 26 and 52.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The avacopan group reported statistically significantly better outcomes on the EuroQOL-5D-5L instrument (both Visual Analogue Scale and EQ Index).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The topline safety results revealed an acceptable safety profile in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having serious adverse events, or SAEs, in the avacopan group than in the prednisone active comparator SOC control group. A full analysis of the data is underway and expanded results are expected be presented at upcoming medical meetings and in a future publication.

 Avacopan Regulatory Matters in ANCA Vasculitis
 Based on the success of the avacopan clinical studies in ANCA vasculitis, we plan to file an NDA with the FDA in mid-2020 and will support our alliance partner, Vifor, with their filing of applications for regulatory approval internationally.
 Avacopan has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitides (granulomatosis with polyangiitis or Wegener’s granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome, and by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for treatment of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, both forms of ANCA vasculitis.
 Complement 3 Glomerulopathy (C3G) 
 C3G disease is an ultra-rare disease of the kidney that is characterized by deposition of the complement fragment known as C3 in the glomeruli, or filtration units of the kidney, leading to inflammatory cell accumulation, potentially leading to significant kidney damage and eventual renal failure. The prevalence of C3G is estimated at two to three per million people or approximately 800 patients in the United States and approximately 2,000 in Europe. 
 There is currently no approved effective standard therapy for C3G. Typically, patients receive one or more non-specific immunosuppressants. Without treatment, C3G may lead to kidney failure, and the current array of unapproved therapies at best only delays end stage renal disease, or ESRD. Kidney transplant is frequently the only option, and even after transplantation, the disease returns in a significant number of affected individuals. 
 Role of C5a and C5aR in C3G
 While the disease name refers to complement 3, it is well known that the C5a receptor pathway, which is further downstream of C3 in the complement cascade and the target of avacopan, is an essential part of the disease causing pathology. Hence, C3 is a marker of more general complement activation. 
 Avacopan Phase II Clinical Trial in C3G
 We launched a registration-supporting clinical trial to study avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3G, the so-called ACCOLADE trial. The clinical trial is expected to enroll up to 88 patients with C3G, including both C3 Glomerulonephritis and Dense Deposit Disease. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan compared to placebo based on histologic changes in kidney biopsies taken at baseline and after 26 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint will be based on the percent change from baseline in the C3G Histologic Index for disease activity. 
 The secondary objectives of this trial include evaluation of: (i) the safety of avacopan compared to placebo based on the incidence of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory measurements, and vital signs; (ii) changes in laboratory parameters of renal disease including eGFR, proteinuria, and urinary excretion of MCP-1 with avacopan compared to placebo; (iii) health-related quality-of-life changes based on Short Form-36 version 2, or SF-36 v2, and EuroQOL-5D-5L, or EQ-5D-5L, with avacopan compared to placebo; and (iv) the PK profile of avacopan in patients with C3G.
 Patients meeting inclusion criteria start study drug treatment on Day 1. Patients receive avacopan 30 mg or matching placebo orally twice-daily. The placebo-controlled treatment period is 26 weeks (182 days). This will be followed by 26 weeks study period during which time all patients will receive avacopan. Thereafter, all patients will be followed for eight weeks (56 days) without study drug treatment. We expect to report topline data from the ACCOLADE trial in the second half of 2020.

 Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) 
 HS is a chronic, inﬂammatory, debilitating skin disease characterized by recurrent, painful, nodules and abscesses, ultimately leading to the formation of draining fistulas (also known as sinus tracts) as well as scarring. The disease originates from inflammation and occlusion of the hair follicle. Apart from pain, the nodules may rupture, and often extrude a purulent, foul-smelling discharge leading to substantial social embarrassment for these patients. Due to its chronic nature and frequently occurring relapses of the skin lesions, HS has a great impact on the patient’s quality of life, deeply affecting social, working, and psychological aspects. 
 In the United States, the estimated prevalence of moderate-to-severe HS is up to 200,000 patients. In Europe, the number of affected patients is believed to be greater, with higher prevalence.
 Depending on the severity of disease, the current SOC for HS patients includes topical, oral or intravenous antibiotic treatment, as well as surgery. Adalimumab, an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, is the only drug indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe HS. Two pivotal adalimumab trials showed that approximately 50% of the patients who were treated with adalimumab achieved an improvement in their skin lesion, as measured by the widely accepted HiSCR (Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response) assessment instrument. There remains a high unmet medical need, however, as a very large proportion of the patients with moderate-to-severe HS do not adequately respond to adalimumab or other therapies used in the SOC.
 Role of C5a and C5aR in HS
 Neutrophils are believed to play an important disease-promoting role, as well as certain cytokines and mediators commonly found in autoimmune diseases, such as TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-1 and others such as C5a. C5a promotes inflammatory mediators and is a strong activator of neutrophils. HS is a neutrophil-driven skin disease and C5a has been found activated and significantly elevated in plasma of HS patients, as compared to healthy controls. 
 With the role of C5a in HS, our C5aR inhibitor avacopan could be effective in mediating the disease course of HS. Avacopan is a small molecule that is conveniently administered as an oral medication and could present itself as advantageous over intravenous or subcutaneous injections treatments for this condition. 
 Avacopan Phase IIb Clinical Trial in HS
 Based on the role of neutrophils and complement activation in the pathogenesis of HS, we believe that there is significant interest in the medical-scientific community to develop avacopan for the treatment of patients in HS. We have an ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial, the AURORA trial, of avacopan in patients with moderate-to-severe HS. 
 The AURORA trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three arm Phase IIb trial in approximately 390 subjects with moderate-to-severe HS (Hurley stage II or III). Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to a treatment of 10 mg avacopan twice-daily, 30 mg avacopan twice-daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects treated with 10 mg or 30 mg twice-daily during the blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week treatment period will be followed by an additional 24-week, active treatment period during which they will continue to receive the same dose regimen, either 10 mg or 30 mg avacopan twice-daily. Subjects on placebo who complete the blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week period will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive 10 mg or 30 mg avacopan twice-daily during the 24-week active treatment period. Thereafter, all subjects will be followed without study drug for eight weeks before they exit the study. 
 The primary efficacy objective is based on subjects achieving a HiSCR after 12 weeks of treatment. HiSCR is defined as at least a 50% reduction in abscess and inflammatory nodule count and no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count at Week 12 relative to baseline. The primary safety objective is to evaluate the safety of avacopan compared to placebo based on the adverse event incidence, changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, and vital signs. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System, or IHS4, individual inflammatory lesion counts, the subject’s global assessment of skin pain numeric rating scale, the Sartorius score, Hidradenitis Suppurativa-Physician’s Global Assessment, and the proportion of subjects who experienced flare or who received rescue therapy, and the duration of flare. Other secondary objectives include the assessment of subject reported outcomes including health-related quality-of-life changes based on the SF-36 v2, the EQ-5D-5L, and the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Quality of Life Index as well as the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of avacopan in subjects with HS. We expect to report topline data from AURORA trial in the third quarter of 2020.

 Avacopan Commercialization Strategy 
 We plan on building a commercial infrastructure and deploying an appropriately sized specialty field force in the United States to commercialize avacopan in ANCA vasculitis. We expect that our future field force will focus primarily on a subset of rheumatologists and nephrologists who treat this disease. In territories outside of the United States, our partner Vifor would be responsible for the commercialization of avacopan.
Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor
 In May 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Vifor, which we refer to as the Avacopan Agreement, to commercialize avacopan for orphan renal diseases in Europe and certain other markets. In connection with the Avacopan Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $85.0 million, comprising $60.0 million in cash and $25.0 million in the form of an equity investment to purchase 3,333,333 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.50 per share. In February 2017, we and Vifor entered into the Avacopan Amendment to expand the licensed territory to include all markets outside the United States and China and we received an additional $20.0 million upfront cash commitment. Upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales based milestones with avacopan, we will receive additional payments under this agreement. In addition, we will receive royalties, with rates ranging from the teens to mid-twenties, on future potential net sales of avacopan by Vifor in the licensed territories. In December 2017, we achieved the first regulatory milestone under the Avacopan Agreement in the amount of $50.0 million, following the EMA’s validation of the conditional marketing authorizatoin, or CMA, application for avacopan for the treatment of patients with ANCA vasculitis. In June 2018, we and Vifor entered into the Avacopan Letter Agreement to further expand the Vifor territories under the Avacopan Agreement to provide Vifor with exclusive commercialization rights in China and we received a $5.0 million payment for the expanded rights. We retain control of ongoing and future development of avacopan (other than country-specific development in the licensed territories) and all commercialization rights to avacopan in the United States.
 Under a prior development and commercialization agreement with Glaxo Group Limited, or GSK, an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline, which ended in 2013, we are subject to reverse royalties to GSK of 3% on annual worldwide net sales of avacopan, not to exceed $50.0 million in total royalties.
 CCX140 - Chronic and Orphan Kidney Diseases

 Our second drug candidate in the orphan disease space is CCX140, an inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. CCX140 is an orally-administered small molecule that is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. CCX140 has an excellent preclinical and clinical profile, including good safety and tolerability demonstrated in hundreds of healthy volunteers or patients with diabetes or diabetic nephropathy, or DN, across seven clinical trials. These clinical trials include a successfully completed one-year dosing of CCX140 in a Phase II trial in chronic kidney disease, or CKD, associated with diabetes. Preclinical data to date suggest CCR2 inhibition involves a unique mechanism of action in the kidney including a novel element of renal cellular protection at the level of the podocyte leading to rapid improvement in proteinuria. CCX140 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of FSGS.
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) 
 FSGS is a histologic lesion that is associated with the clinical presentation, in children or adults, of proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal insufficiency. Nephrotic syndrome is the combination of nephrotic-range proteinuria (loss of more than three grams of protein per day into the urine) with a low serum albumin level and edema. Each kidney is made up of approximately one million tiny filters called “glomeruli.” Glomeruli filter blood, taking out the water-like part that becomes urine and leaving protein in the blood. When glomeruli or sections of the glomeruli become damaged or scarred (sclerosis), proteins leak into the urine (proteinuria). FSGS is understood to start with damage to podocytes, cells that wrap around capillaries of the glomerulus. Podocytes form part of the barrier that enable the glomerulus to filter the blood in a manner that retains large molecules such as proteins, while smaller molecules such as water, salts, and sugars are filtered as the first step in the formation of urine.

Index to Financial Statements
 FSGS is classified as primary or idiopathic when the cause is not known, and secondary when it occurs in the setting of recognized genetic mutations or associated disease. The distinction between primary and secondary FSGS can be difficult, but it has been estimated that in 80% of the cases the etiology is unknown. Primary or idiopathic FSGS often presents with the nephrotic syndrome. Secondary FSGS, which most often presents with non-nephrotic proteinuria and some degree of renal insufficiency, can occur in the setting of genetic vulnerability, podocyte injury due to toxins or infections, or as an adaptive response to glomerular hypertrophy or hyper-filtration. 
 Symptoms or signs of FSGS may not be noticeable early in the course of disease, presenting only when sufficiently advanced to cause edema, or when physical examination and laboratory assessment reveal proteinuria, low blood albumin levels, high cholesterol and/or high blood pressure. FSGS is a disease characterized by progressive glomerular scarring and is life-threatening. In 20% of children and in 40% of adults, it is the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome. When accompanied by high levels of proteinuria at the time of presentation, 50% of patients with FSGS will progress to ESRD within three to eight years. FSGS is causal for 4% of all ESRD cases. Furthermore, after kidney transplantation for primary FSGS, the recurrence rate is 40%. 
 FSGS is a rare form of CKD that affects approximately 80,000 patients in the United States, with 5,500 to 9,500 new cases each year. FSGS attacks the glomeruli causing scarring which leads to permanent kidney damage. Progressive FSGS can lead to ESRD, ultimately requiring kidney transplant or renal dialysis and total health expenditures of hundreds of thousands of dollars each year per patient. 
 Current Treatment Approaches in FSGS
 There are no approved drugs for the treatment of FSGS. Moreover, current treatment approaches are not very effective in halting the disease. Usually, treatments for FSGS include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, or RAAS, system blockers, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, diuretics and diet change (reducing sodium and protein intake).
 RAAS blockade reduces proteinuria and slows progression in proteinuric kidney diseases, and is commonly used for treatment of secondary FSGS. Whether or not this is effective in primary FSGS is unknown. Patients with histologic evidence of primary FSGS who have nephrotic syndrome are usually offered disease-modifying therapy with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs. However, in the absence of nephrotic range proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), administration of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs is generally not recommended. In many cases, an overall course of treatment of at least six months is required and complete remission may not be attained for 12 months or longer. Shorter courses (two months or less) result in much lower remission rates (20% to 30%). 
 Patients with little or no reduction in protein excretion at 12 to 16 weeks are considered steroid resistant. Initial therapy of steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant FSGS consists of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with or without low-dose prednisone. Among those unresponsive to this combination, or among those with substantially reduced eGFR (<40 mL/min per 1.73 m2), mycophenolate mofetil in combination with glucocorticoids is recommended. In addition, in patients at increased risk for glucocorticoid-associated toxicity (e.g., obese patients, diabetic patients, patients with severe osteoporosis, patients >70 years of age), cyclosporine or tacrolimus with or without low-dose prednisone has been recommended, although data evaluating this strategy are limited. Calcineurin inhibitors must be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because of the nephrotoxicity of these drugs, and some authors recommend avoiding these in subjects whose kidney function approaches renal failure, i.e., subjects with an eGFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies in FSGS
 As described above, there are no effective therapies available for FSGS. Control of hypertension, particularly with angiotensin inhibitors, is supportive but does not address the underlying pathology. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants are also used, but the results have been inconsistent. The increased risk of infection associated with these agents is a significant concern. Histologic recurrence in renal transplants is high, with high levels of proteinuria portending a poor renal prognosis.

 Role of CCR2 inhibition in FSGS 
 There is evidence that the C-C chemokine receptor known as CCR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of FSGS. CCR2 is a major driver of monocyte migration and activation, and has been shown to mediate renal interstitial inflammation and tubular atrophy in a number of chronic renal diseases by recruiting monocytes to the renal interstitium. Further, studies have shown that the degree of protein excretion correlates with urine MCP-1 levels, one of the signature ligands of CCR2 and a biomarker of inflammation, and the infiltration of immune cells called macrophages into the kidney in patients with CKD. Experiments performed in vitro have added to the mechanistic rationale for the notion that CCR2 is an important driver of FSGS. Proteinuria is the hallmark characteristic of FSGS, and in vitro experiments have found that tubular epithelial cells release MCP-1 when exposed to serum proteins on the inside of the tubules. Clinically, in children with FSGS, urinary MCP-1 levels correlate with the degree of proteinuria.  
 Blocking CCR2 provided significant and rapid renal protection in two distinct models of FSGS, as measured both by reduction in proteinuria and improvement in multiple histological parameters, and it thus represents a novel and mechanistically-distinct approach for the treatment of FSGS.  
 In the 5/6 remnant kidney model, mice had a rapid reduction in proteinuria when treated with a CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor. Combining a CCR2 inhibitor with a RAAS inhibitor reduced the proteinuria by 91%. The protective effects were evident within one week of treatment and were maintained for the duration of the study (six weeks). The same renal protective effects of CCR2 blockade were seen in the adriamycin nephropathy model. Administration of adriamycin caused significant proteinuria, which was significantly reduced by the combination of a CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor after two weeks of treatment. Histological parameters also improved with the combination of the CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor; these included reduced glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular sclerosis, mesangial expansion and increased podocyte density. The data suggest CCR2 inhibition may provide a novel approach for the treatment of chronic kidney diseases. 
 CCX140 Clinical Development
 Our clinical development strategy was to first assess the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in healthy subjects, then in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, and finally to evaluate the drug in patients with DN. As a precursor to our clinical trials in patients with DN, we completed a 159-patient randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with type 2 diabetes, one of the most common causes of nephropathy. We also subsequently completed a 332-patient randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with DN. 
 Based on safety and encouraging efficacy signals related to reduction in proteinuria and stabilization/improvement of renal function observed in the Phase II study in patients with DN, we launched our clinical-development program of CCX140 for the treatment of patients with FSGS. 
 CCX140 Phase I Clinical Trials 
 We completed four Phase I clinical trials in 118 healthy volunteers. A CCX140 dose range of 0.05 to 15 mg was studied. CCX140 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events observed in these Phase I clinical trials. The PK profile was supportive of once-daily oral dosing of CCX140 in the Phase II clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients with DN.
CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trial in Type 2 Diabetes 
 Our Phase II clinical trial was designed to demonstrate safety of CCX140 in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, and to examine the effect of CCX140 on glycemic indices. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled clinical trial in 159 patients with type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin for at least eight weeks, with 32 patients receiving placebo, 32 receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride (an approved therapeutic for type 2 diabetes serving as the active control), 63 receiving 5 mg of CCX140 and 32 receiving 10 mg of CCX140 orally once-daily for 28 days. 
 The clinical trial met its primary objective by demonstrating the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in these patients. In addition, CCX140 showed encouraging signs of biological activity based on a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c, a marker of glycemic control, for the 10 mg dose group.

 CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trial in DN 
 We completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with DN. A total of 332 patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The goals of this clinical trial were to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with DN. The primary efficacy objective was evaluation of the effect of CCX140 on albuminuria. Secondary efficacy objectives were evaluation of the effect of CCX140 on HbA1c and eGFR. The three treatment groups consisted of (i) SOC, (ii) a RAAS inhibitor, plus placebo (control group), and (iii) 5 mg and 10 mg of CCX140 once-daily plus SOC. The treatment duration was up to 52 weeks, with a four-week follow-up period. Patients with residual albuminuria, despite being on a stable therapeutic dose of a RAAS inhibitor, were included in this clinical trial. The key efficacy endpoint was a change from baseline in first morning UACR, a major indicator of renal health. 
 The Phase II trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that treatment with 5 mg of CCX140 given orally once-daily added to a SOC regimen of RAAS inhibitor treatment resulted in a statistically significant (p=0.01) improvement in UACR, beyond that achieved with SOC alone. The maximum treatment effect (24% reduction) was reached at 12 weeks, and sustained reduction in albuminuria induced by CCX140 relative to SOC alone was observed over the full year (UACR at each one of the ten time points over the 52-week treatment period in the patients who received 5 mg CCX140 continuously for 52 weeks, were below those of the SOC alone group). A dose of 10 mg CCX140 per day did not provide more improvement in albuminuria as compared to the 5 mg dose. CCX140 did not affect systematic blood pressure, suggesting that the beneficial effect of CCX140 is mediated locally in the kidney micro-environment, possibly through a beneficial reduction in renal inflammation. CCX140 was well-tolerated with a low overall dropout rate over the 52-week treatment period (10%). No safety issues were observed that would prevent further clinical development of CCX140 in DN. 
 CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trials in Primary or Genetic FSGS
 The successfully completed CCX140 Phase II clinical trial in DN, which demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in proteinuria compared to SOC, showed the most pronounced effect in the highest proteinuric patients. In addition, preclinical data to date suggest CCR2 inhibition involves a unique mechanism of action in the kidney including a novel element of renal cellular protection at the level of the podocyte, leading to rapid improvement in proteinuria. Building upon our orphan kidney disease franchise, we launched our clinical development program of CCX140 in patients with primary or genetic FSGS. Our clinical development program will comprise two populations of patients:
  
(i) | Primary or genetic FSGS patients with sub-nephrotic proteinuria (>1 g/g) – LUMINA-1 trial; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Primary or genetic FSGS patients with nephrotic syndrome (levels of proteinuria >3.5 g/g) – LUMINA-2 trial.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The LUMINA-1 trial is a randomized controlled, dose ranging study with the aim to evaluate the effect of treatment with CCX140 in subjects with sub-nephrotic primary or genetic FSGS. The LUMINA-2 trial is an open label, intra-subject dose escalation study in subjects with primary or genetic FSGS and nephrotic syndrome. The primary efficacy objective of both trials is to evaluate the effect of CCX140 on proteinuria, as assessed by factors including reduction in proteinuria through the 12-week treatment period. Other study objectives will include the assessment of partial or complete remission and the time to, and proportion of subjects with, partial or complete remission and other variables. Changes in quality-of-life changes (SF-36 v2, EQ-5D-5L) will also be assessed.
 Patient enrollment of LUMINA-1 was completed in August 2019, and we expect to report topline data in the second quarter of 2020. Topline data from the LUMINA-2 trial are expected in the second half of 2020. 
 CCX140 Commercialization Strategy 
 We plan to leverage the commercialization infrastructure and field force that we are building to commercialize avacopan in the Unites States and to commercialize our orphan disease drug candidates such as CCX140, if approved. FSGS patients are primarily being treated by nephrologists in so-called centers of excellence in renal diseases. Similar to avacopan, we plan on establishing a commercial presence focused on the nephrology arena. In territories outside of the United States, our partner Vifor will be responsible for the commercialization of CCX140.

 Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor
 In December 2016, we entered into a second collaboration and license agreement with Vifor, which we refer to as the CCX140 Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Vifor exclusive rights to commercialize CCX140 in rare renal diseases in markets outside the United States and China. We are responsible for the clinical development of CCX140 in rare renal diseases, while sharing the cost of such development with Vifor. In connection with the CCX140 Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront commitment totaling $50.0 million and are eligible to receive additional payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales based milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on potential net sales of CCX140 in the licensed territories. Under the CCX140 Agreement, Vifor retains an option to solely develop and commercialize CCX140 in more prevalent forms of CKD. Should Vifor later exercise the CKD option, we would receive co-promotion rights in CKD in the United States. In June 2018, we and Vifor entered into the CCX140 Letter Agreement to further expand the Vifor territories under the CCX140 Agreement to provide Vifor with exclusive commercialization rights in China and we received a non-refundable $5.0 million payment for the expanded rights. Additionally, in June 2018, we and Vifor entered into an amendment to the CCX140 Agreement, which we refer to as the CCX140 Amendment, to clarify the timing of certain payments with respect to development funding of the CCX140 program by Vifor, and we received a non-refundable payment of $11.5 million. We retain control of ongoing and future development of CCX140 (other than country-specific development in the licensed territories) and all commercialization rights to CCX140 in the United States.
Early Stage Drug Candidates
 Immuno-Oncology and Other Therapeutic Areas 
 In oncologic disease, tumors can profoundly subvert inflammatory and effector immune responses. In the tumor cellular microenvironment, CCR2 bearing cells are thought to largely have an immunosuppressive behavior. These are the so-called myeloid derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs. These cells effectively help tumors hide from the body’s cytotoxic immune response to tumor cells. Inhibiting CCR2, and thus the MDSCs controlled by CCR2, could therefore lead to the liberation of the cytotoxic immune response against the tumor cells, tumor shrinkage, and improved patient survival. We have an ongoing clinical development program for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer with our drug candidate CCX872, our second inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2.
Understanding Pancreatic Cancer 
 Pancreatic cancer is a rare but deadly cancer. It is the 15th most common cancer worldwide but the fourth highest cause of cancer-related death. In the United States in 2019, approximately 56,770 people were expected to develop pancreatic cancer, and within five years of diagnosis, about 80% of those patients are expected to succumb to the disease. Primarily due to the aging of the population, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is predicted to increase to 62,000 new cases per year by 2030. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which represents 85% of all pancreatic cancers, is characterized by rapid progression and a dismal prognosis. Because of the deep location of the pancreas in the abdomen and the lack of markers of early disease, most cancers remain asymptomatic until they obstruct the biliary tract, which usually occurs with tumors of the pancreatic head, or until they become metastatic. Hence, less than 15% of patients initially present with a resectable cancer (stage 1 or 2), while the majority of patients have either a locally advanced, nonresectable, stage 3 cancer or a metastatic, stage 4 cancer at the time of diagnosis. Even with the best current treatment, the median overall survival of these patients is less than one year, an outlook that has remained largely unchanged over the last few decades. 
 The dismal prognosis of this cancer results from the combination of the late diagnosis, the early metastatic dissemination, and resistance to most chemotherapies. The main factors explaining this resistance to treatment include a very high rate of activation of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene, mutations, a propensity for both local extension and distal spreading, the presence of a dense stromal tissue surrounding the tumor that results in a hypoxic, hypovascularized environment with high interstitial pressure, which may impede drug delivery, and ultimately the loss of immune control. Therapeutic interventions that improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer are urgently needed.

 Limitations of Current Therapies
 Current SOC regimens are not only limited by modest efficacy but also by significant toxicity. For patients with nonresectable cancer (stage 3 or 4), FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil) or a combination of gemcitabine and nanoparticle albumin-bound-, or nab-, paclitaxel are considered standard treatments, but the median overall survival of patients remains less than one year. Further, these treatments often are poorly tolerated. FOLFIRINOX is associated with a high rate of Grade 3-4 adverse events, can rarely be administered for more than six months, and is mostly prescribed to patients with excellent performance status. Frail, elderly patients usually receive palliative treatment. Extensive research is ongoing to identify novel agents with improved efficacy and a reduced toxicity profile, including chemotherapies with improved formulations of currently available agents, therapies targeted against specific oncogenic pathways, or cancer vaccines.
 Role of CCR2 in Pancreatic Cancer
 Human pancreatic tumors are characterized by a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment. In the tumor cellular microenvironment, CCR2 bearing cells are thought to be largely of an immunosuppressive behavior; these are the so-called MDSCs. These cells effectively help tumors hide from the body’s cytotoxic immune response to tumor cells. Inhibiting CCR2, and thus the MDSCs controlled by CCR2, could therefore lead to the liberation of the cytotoxic immune response against the tumor cells, and improved patient survival.
 Clinical Development
 CCX872 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CCR2. The objective of using a CCR2 inhibitor such as CCX872 is to reduce the suppressive myeloid cell presence in the tumor and, in doing so, slow the progression of disease in these patients. We believe that CCX872 may represent a promising novel immunotherapeutic approach. Drugs that block CCR2 have shown evidence of activity in patients with pancreatic cancer as well as in a mouse orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.
Phase I Clinical Trials
 We completed a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial in healthy subjects. This clinical trial was a combined single-and-multiple-ascending dose clinical trial in 40 subjects. The clinical trial was conducted in the Netherlands. CCX872 doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg and 300 mg were given as a single dose in the first study period and once-daily doses for seven days in the second study period. Data showed that CCX872 was well-tolerated and appeared to be safe in healthy volunteers at all dose levels studied. There were no serious adverse events or dropouts due to adverse events in the trial. The most common adverse events reported by subjects receiving CCX872 in the multi-dose period were dizziness, diarrhea, and headache. These events typically were mild in intensity and did not result in dosing discontinuation. The results showed that CCX872 was safe and well-tolerated. CCX872 was able to block CCR2 in the circulation, and it had a predictable dose-linear PK profile. 
 Our Phase Ib study for CCX872 explores a novel approach (CCR2 inhibition) for the treatment of patients with stage 3 and 4 pancreatic cancer. Beyond the field of pancreatic cancer, the results of this study will also advance our understanding of the role of chemokines in solid tumors and of the potential for chemokine receptor inhibitors as therapeutic options in cancer patients when combined with SOC regimens. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of orally-administered CCX872 with respect to disease progression in patients with nonresectable pancreatic cancer being treated with FOLFIRINOX, one of the current SOC treatments for this disease. Enrollment in the trial occurred in two stages, Part A (single dose) and Part B (multiple dose). Part A has been completed. Results showed that a single oral dose of 150-mg CCX872 was well-tolerated and safe in this study. The PK profile in patients with pancreatic cancer was in line with the PK profile observed in healthy volunteers in the previous clinical trial. CCX872 was effective in blocking CCR2 in circulating cells as measured by CCR2 occupancy and internalization assays, as well as migration assays. Successful completion of Part A led to initiation of Part B. 
 Enrollment of 50 patients in Part B was completed in 2016. In January 2017, we reported 24-week progression-free survival, or PFS, data, 12-week objective response rate, or ORR, data, and initial overall survival data. PFS rate was 57% at week 24 in the primary analysis population and median PFS was 179 days. ORR was 37% at week 12 in the primary analysis population. Overall survival rate was 52% at week 48 in the primary analysis population and median survival time was 11.5 months. The longest ongoing CCX872 treatment period for a patient in the study to date is 73 weeks (and continuing). CCX872 has been well-tolerated in the clinical trial. There has been no apparent additional safety burden of combining CCX872 with FOLFIRINOX, as evidenced by an incidence and rate of adverse events in the trial to date consistent with data reported historically for FOLFIRINOX on its own.

 In January 2018, we further reported overall survival data at 18 months of 29% for the primary analysis population and 28% in patients with metastatic pancreatic disease. This compares favorably with previously published data of overall survival of 18.6% at 18 months for FOLFIRINOX regimen alone in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Overall, circulating monocytic myeloid derived cells likely including myeloid suppressor cells were reduced by treatment.
 Preclinical Development in Immuno-Oncology 
 One of the most exciting advances in oncology in decades is the observation that modifiers of the activity of the patient’s own immune system can profoundly enhance their response to chemotherapy.
 A critical cellular component of this response are the MDSCs, which inhibit the activity of the effector T cells, and thus dampen the immune response of the body to the tumor. These MDSCs express chemokine and chemoattractant receptors that they use to migrate to the tumor microenvironment. We believe that blocking these chemokine receptors with small molecule antagonists could be effective either as stand-alone therapies for certain cancers or by synergistic effect when given in combination with traditional chemotherapies or other immunotherapies.
 We have discovered small molecule inhibitors that target these chemoattractant receptors, and one or more of them may be developed in certain oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors.
 In our preclinical research, we are conducting studies with various chemokine receptor inhibitors in combination with check point inhibitors, such as those inhibiting the programmed cell death-1, or PD-1, programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, pathway, that we believe may result in a greater anti-tumor effect, than with check-point inhibition alone.
 A growing body of data suggests that a number of chemokine receptors, including, but not limited to, CCR1, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR7 and CXCR2, may play diverse roles in cancer growth, cancer metastasis, cancer angiogenesis, or the composition of the tumor microenvironment. Given the potential role of chemokine receptors in cancer cell survival, the combination of chemokine receptor antagonists with traditional chemotherapeutic agents or with immunotherapy, such as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors is an attractive strategy because it may result in greater efficacy and/or allow dose reductions of the chemotherapeutic drugs and therefore limit systemic side effects.
 In December 2019, we, together with our collaborators at University of Florida and Massachusetts General Hospital, published results from a non-clinical study in which we evaluated the effectiveness of our CCR2 antagonist CCX872 in combination with anti-PD-1 in combatting glioblastoma brain cancer. Using two mouse models of glioblastoma, we targeted chemokine receptors that are important for allowing MDSCs to infiltrate into the region surrounding glioblastoma tumors. In mice that were bred to lack chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and to develop glioblastoma, MDSCs could not carry out such infiltration. Treating these mice with an immune checkpoint inhibitor stimulated a strong anti-cancer immune response and prolonged the animals’ survival. In mice with normal CCR2, treatment with a molecule that blocks CCR2 had similar effects.
 The CCR2 antagonist used in this study—called CCX872— has passed Phase Ib safety trials in patients with pancreatic tumors, and clinical trials are ongoing to investigate the use of CCR2 inhibitors in several cancers. Thus, we believe the results of this study support targeting CCR2-expressing MDSCs as a means to enhance immunotherapies, and warrant investigation of this combination therapy in clinical trials for patients with glioblastoma.
 In another immune-oncology program, we have further optimized our unique class of human PD-L1 small molecule inhibitors. The lead compounds possess high oral bioavailability and desirable safety profiles. They also exhibited activity in blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in multiple biochemical and cell-based assays.  Non-clinical data suggest that the small molecules prevented the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by inducing dimerization of the PD-L1 protein. In animal tumor models, these compounds potently reduced tumor growth with the activity being similar to a clinically-proven anti-human PD-L1 antibody. The tumor analyses demonstrated that these compounds almost completely occupied human PD-L1 on the tumor cells, and thus potently blocked the interaction of PD-1/PD-L1 and enhance the immune responses against tumor. We believe these novel small molecules could provide a valuable orally dosed alternative to the current antibody-based PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutics.

 Other Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or IBD (Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis)
 IBD refers to two diseases – Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis – both characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn’s disease can cause inflammation in any part of the digestive tract but often affects the tail end of the small intestine. Ulcerative colitis is inflammation of the large intestine. Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic and recurring inflammatory conditions. Researchers believe that these conditions occur when the body’s inflammatory cells become over-reactive and mount a destructive inflammatory response. Current treatments for IBD include steroids, 5-aminosalicylic acids, immunosuppressive therapies, such as azathioprine or biologic agents such as TNF-α inhibitors and integrin inhibitors, such as the anti-α4β7 antibody, vedolizumab, and when all else fails, surgery.
Next Generation CCR9 Inhibitor CCX507 
 Also in the area of IBD, our drug candidate CCX507 builds on our expertise in the area of CCR9 inhibitors and IBD. CCX507 is a second generation CCR9 inhibitor. CCX507 is selective for CCR9 relative to all other chemokine receptors, orally bioavailable, and has an excellent preclinical safety profile. CCX507 has shown greater potency towards CCR9 than vercirnon in non-clinical studies. We completed Phase I clinical development, which demonstrated that CCX507 was safe and well-tolerated, and blocked CCR9 on circulating leukocytes. Additionally, preclinical data of CCX507 in combination with an anti-α4β7 antibody or anti-TNFα antibody showed that combined treatment reduced the severity of colitis better than monotherapy with either drug alone. We plan to move CCX507 forward to Phase II clinical trials, either by ourselves or with a strategic partner.
Th17 Driven Diseases and CCR6 
 One of the most intriguing areas of current research in immunology involves a relatively recently discovered type of helper T cells known as Th17 cells. There is a large amount of preclinical and clinical data that implicate Th17 cells, as well as Interleukin 17, or IL-17, in the development of a large number of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and multiple sclerosis.
 Activated Th17 cells isolated from chronically inflamed human tissues produce high levels of TNF-α and other cytokines. A hallmark of Th17 cells is that they express high levels of the chemokine receptor known as CCR6, which is not found on Th1 and Th2 cells. High levels of the CCR6 chemokine ligand, CCL20, have been found in psoriatic skin, in rheumatoid arthritis joint biopsies, and in asthmatic lungs.
 We believe that these are potential therapeutic opportunities for a CCR6 inhibitor. We have produced several unique CCR6 inhibitor leads, which are now being optimized through medicinal chemistry approaches and undergoing further evaluation in preclinical pharmacology models.
 We have shown in preclinical models that an orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR6 confers protection against IL17-mediated inflammation. We have generated potent orally bioavailable CCR6 inhibitors that inhibit CCL20-mediated chemotaxis of both human and mouse CCR6-positive cells. The utility of CCR6 inhibition was tested in preclinical models of psoriasis, and demonstrated that animals treated with our CCR6 inhibitor were protected against imiquimod induced skin thickening. Histological analysis of the skin confirmed the protective effect of our CCR6 inhibitor compared to an aqueous vehicle control and significantly reduced ear-thickening induced by intradermal injections of Interleukin 23, or IL-23, a cytokine that is important for the terminal differentiation and pathogenicity of Th17 cells.
 The mechanism of action for CCR6 inhibitors is different from other therapeutics targeting IL-17, because inhibition of CCR6 disrupts the recruitment of infiltrating leukocytes into the epidermis upon skin damage, thereby protecting against epidermal hyperplasia, or an abnormal increase in the number of cells on the skin. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of CCR6 with an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor mitigates IL-17-driven inflammation in psoriasis models, and its distinct mechanism of action suggests it may offer additional efficacy when added to current SOC.
 We presented data from in vivo models of psoriasis with a selective orally-administered CCR6 inhibitor. Genetically modified mice demonstrate that psoriatic lesions do not progress in mice lacking chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20, the only known chemokine ligand for CCR6, is highly expressed in psoriatic plaques. Our potent, orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of CCR6 ameliorated skin inflammation in the IL-23 and imiquimod induced models of psoriasis, and in the IL-36 induced model representative of rare form of psoriasis referred to as generalized pustular psoriasis. Results from this work were published as a peer reviewed journal article in the Journal of Immunology in January 2019. CCR6 antagonists present a novel therapeutic approach to treating multiple forms of psoriasis.

Nonetheless, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention. 
 Competition
 We compete in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address ANCA vasculitis, HS, C3G, FSGS and other renal diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders, and cancer. We face significant competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address these markets. Many of our competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, research, and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. 
 It is possible that our competitors will develop and market drugs that are less expensive and more effective than our drug candidates, or that will render our drug candidates obsolete. It is also possible that our competitors will commercialize competing drugs before we or our partners can launch any drugs developed from our drug candidates. 
 Avacopan, our C5aR inhibitor, if approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of ANCA vasculitis, might compete with current treatments, such as prednisone, CYC, RTX, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. If avacopan is approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of C3G, avacopan might compete with treatments that are in development. If avacopan were approved for the treatment of HS, it would potentially compete with adalimumab (Humira®) or other TNF-alpha antibodies which physician sometimes prescribe off-label for the treatment of HS.

 CCX140, our lead CCR2 inhibitor, if approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of FSGS, might compete with treatments commonly used for type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients, RAAS inhibitors, are commonly prescribed treatments used to reduce blood pressure and preserve kidney function, reducing the progression of the disease. Other commercially available treatment options for FSGS include steroids, RAAS inhibitors, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®, Myortic®), tacrolimus (Prograf®), CYC (Cytoxan®), RTX, ACTHAR®, sirolimus (Rapamycin®, Rapamune®), and Liposorber® LA-15 System. If CCX140 is approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of FSGS, CCX140 might compete with treatments that are in development. 
 CCX872, our other CCR2 inhibitor, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, might compete with treatments that are currently available, such as chemotherapeutic drugs including gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, or new treatments in development. 
 Many of these currently approved treatments have notable and common adverse events including liver and bone marrow toxicity, renal toxicity, pneumonitis, immunosuppression, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases and infections. 
 We expect that competition among any of our drugs approved for sale will be based on various factors, including drug safety and efficacy, prevalence of negative side effects, reliability, ease of administration, availability, price, insurance coverage and reimbursement status and patent position. We believe that our ability to compete depends largely upon our ability to research, develop and commercialize our existing and future drug candidates. Further, we need to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection, develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of drugs. Our ability to compete will also be affected by the speed at which we are able to identify and develop, conduct clinical testing and obtain regulatory approvals of our drug candidates. Potential competitors may develop treatments that are more effective and/or safer than our drug candidates or that would make our technology and drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive. 
 Established pharmaceutical companies that currently sell or are developing drugs in our markets of interest include, but are not limited to, AbbVie, Alexion, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Aurinia, Bayer, Biogen, Elan, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt, Merck, Merck Serono, Novartis, Pfizer, Retrophin, Roche/Genentech, Sanofi, Sarfez, Takeda and Teva. In addition, in some instances we may face competition from companies that sell generic versions of approved drugs that are part of the current SOC. Many or all of these established competitors are also involved in research and drug development regarding various chemokine receptors. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are known to be involved in chemokine and chemoattractant research and related drug development include, but are not limited to, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Takeda, Sanofi, Incyte, Alexion, Allergan, Appellis, Omeros, InflaRx, Dimerix, X4 Pharmaceuticals, Mitsubishi Tanabe, Biolinerx, Akari Therapeutics and UCB Pharma, among others. These companies and others also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our current drug candidates are manufactured using commonly used chemical synthetic and engineering processes using readily available or made to order raw materials. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our drug candidates in accordance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, for use in our clinical trials. We currently rely on a single source supplier for our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing requirements for each of our drug candidates and for the manufacturing of drug product. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of our compounds. 
 For clinical supply, we purchase quantities of our drug candidates from our contract manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we place with them. If we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of drug supply or receive raw materials in a timely manner, or secure the manufacturing and release of drug product by the contract manufacturer, we could be required to delay our ongoing clinical trials as we seek, engage and enable alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming.

 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, export and import of our drug candidates. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the FDA’s implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice requirements, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Once a pharmaceutical drug candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including the requirements for informed consent.

 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of an NDA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in accordance with GCP, and so long as the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if necessary. We have open INDs in the United States for avacopan, CCX140, and CCX872. All of our clinical trials are designed to comply with FDA regulatory requirements so that the data from all trials can be used to support a regulatory filing in the United States. Other planned studies with avacopan and CCX140 will likely include the United States and Europe, and potentially other geographies. 
Clinical Trials 
 For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III clinical trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase III clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. An exception might be drugs developed for an orphan indication, where smaller clinical trials might be acceptable to the FDA and the EMA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 New Drug Applications 
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. 
 22

Index to Financial Statements
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase III clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such drug or request a recall of any drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 A sponsor may also seek approval of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for submission to the FDA of the remaining information. In some cases, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that are shown to provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Approvals of this kind, referred to as accelerated approvals, typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase IV clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint. 
 23

Index to Financial Statements
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies.” A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation provides all of the benefits of fast track designation, but provides for more intensive FDA guidance on efficient drug development.
 Drug candidates designed to prevent, diagnose, or treat serious diseases or conditions may also be eligible for “priority review,” or review within a six-month timeframe from the date an NDA for a new molecular entity is accepted for filing, if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing therapies. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review, as applicable, for our drug candidates. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Such diseases and conditions are those that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if they affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for these types of diseases or conditions will be recovered from sales of the drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by that agency. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but it can lead to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. 
 If a drug that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same active chemical entity and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, or EU, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (i) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. 
 24

Index to Financial Statements
 The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 

• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. 
Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, was signed into law. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which have impacted existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act: 

• | imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated a further shift in the burden of Medicaid payments to the states;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Jobs Act, was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in Texas ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Jobs Act. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, or other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the law or our business. 
 26

Index to Financial Statements
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, was enacted, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently, there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The full impact on our business of the Affordable Care Act and other new laws is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our drugs if commercialized. 
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Although none of our drug candidates has been commercialized for any indication, if they are approved for marketing, commercial success of our drug candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state, and private levels. Government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost-containment. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the United States may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include: 
  
• | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reforming drug importation laws.
--+---------------------------------

 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use such therapies. In order to secure coverage, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the drug product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, drug products may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a drug product could reduce physician utilization and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the drug product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for a drug product, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Outside the United States, reimbursement of drug products is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a drug product and may require conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our drug products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for drug products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved drug products. Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drug products.

 While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our drug candidates and operate profitably. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines and individual imprisonment. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;

• | the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Private individuals can bring False Claims Act “qui tam” actions, on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose significant civil fines and penalties, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;

• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Physician Sunshine Act, which requires certain applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations, to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations;

• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, including mandatory contractual terms as well as directly applicable privacy and security standards and requirements. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in significant civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties and/or imprisonment. State attorneys general can also bring a civil action to enjoin a HIPAA violation or to obtain statutory damages on behalf of residents of his or her state; and

• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), 
regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under the Centralized, Mutual Recognition, Decentralized or national EEA member state procedures. The Centralized Procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all member states of the EEA. The Mutual Recognition Procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining Member States
. Under the Decentralized Procedure, if the product has not received a marketing authorization in any EEA member state at the time of application, the applicant can file an application to various EEA member states (choosing once as the so-called reference member states) of its choice which will be reviewed and approved simultaneously by them.
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
