Overview
We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2013 that is focused on owning, operating and acquiring assets from our sponsor or third parties. We aggregate a natural resource, wood fiber, and process it into a transportable form, wood pellets. We sell a significant majority of our wood pellets through long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with creditworthy customers in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), Europe and increasingly in Japan. We own and operate nine plants (collectively, “our plants”) with a combined production capacity of approximately 5.3 million metric tons of wood pellets per year (“MTPY”) in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Mississippi, the production of which is fully contracted through 2025. We export wood pellets through our wholly owned dry-bulk, deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Chesapeake, Virginia (the “Chesapeake terminal”) and terminal assets at the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina (the “Wilmington terminal”) and from third-party deep-water marine terminals in Savannah, Georgia (the “Savannah terminal”), Mobile, Alabama (the “Mobile terminal”) and Panama City, Florida (the “Panama City terminal”). All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged assets, the output from which is fully contracted through 2025, in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows. Our plants are sited in robust fiber baskets providing stable pricing for the low-grade fiber used to produce wood pellets. Our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting, principally low-value wood materials, such as trees generally not suited for sawmilling or other manufactured forest products, and tree tops and limbs, understory, brush and slash that are generated in a harvest.
Our strategy is to fully contract the wood pellet production from our plants under long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with a diversified and creditworthy customer base. Our long-term off-take contracts typically provide for fixed-price deliveries that may include provisions that escalate the price over time and provide for other margin protection. During 2020, production capacity from our wood pellet production plants and wood pellets sourced from our affiliates and third parties were approximately equal to the contracted volumes under our existing long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts. Our long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts provide for a product sales backlog of $14.6 billion and have a total weighted-average remaining term of 12.8 years from February 1, 2021. Under our current product sales backlog, our plants are fully contracted through 2025. Assuming all volumes under the firm and contingent long-term off-take contracts held by our sponsor were included with our product sales backlog for firm and contingent contracted product sales, our product sales backlog would increase to $19.9 billion and the total weighted-average remaining term from February 1, 2021 would increase to 14.0 years.
Our customers use our wood pellets as a substitute fuel for coal in dedicated biomass or co-fired coal power plants. Wood pellets serve as a suitable “drop-in” alternative to coal because of their comparable heat content, density and form. Due to the uninterruptible nature of our customers’ fuel consumption, our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications. We have built our operations and assets to deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality and our proven track record of reliable deliveries enables us to charge premium prices for this certainty. In addition to our customers’ focus on the reliability of supply, they are concerned about the combustion efficiency of the wood pellets and their safe handling. Because combustion efficiency is a function of energy density, particle size distribution, ash/inert content and moisture, our customers require that we supply wood pellets meeting minimum criteria for a variety of specifications and, in some cases, provide incentives for exceeding our contract specifications.
Our Production Plants, Logistics and Storage Capabilities
We procure low-grade wood fiber and process it into utility-grade wood pellets and load the finished wood pellets into railcars, trucks and barges for transportation to deep-water marine terminals, where they are received, stored and ultimately loaded onto oceangoing vessels for delivery to our customers.
We own and operate nine industrial-scale wood pellet production plants strategically located in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, geographic areas in which wood fiber resources are plentiful and readily available. Our plants are constructed according to a “build and copy” approach, which allows for operating efficiencies. Furthermore, our multi-plant profile and scale provide us with flexibility under our portfolio of off-take contracts that enhances the reliability of our deliveries and provides opportunities for optimization.
Our facilities are designed to operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, although we schedule up to 15 days of planned maintenance for our wood pellet production plants during each calendar year. There are no regularly required major turnarounds or overhauls.
The following table describes our wood pellet production plants:

Plant Location | Year of Acquisition or Operations Commenced | Production (MTPY)
Ahoskie, North Carolina | 2011 | 410,000 
Amory, Mississippi | 2010 | 115,000 
Cottondale, Florida | 2015 | 780,000 
Greenwood, South Carolina | 2020 | 500,000 
Hamlet, North Carolina | 2019 | 600,000 
Northampton, North Carolina (1) | 2013 | 750,000 
Sampson, North Carolina | 2016 | 600,000 
Southampton, Virginia (1) | 2013 | 760,000 
Waycross, Georgia | 2020 | 800,000 
Total | | 5,315,000 

(1)    Production capacities for the Northampton and Southampton plants include increased production capacity pursuant to ongoing expansion projects. After a ramp period for the expansion projects, the Northampton and Southampton plants are expected to each reach 750,000 MTPY and 760,000 MTPY, respectively, by the end of 2021.
Ahoskie
We acquired the site of our wood pellet production plant in Ahoskie, North Carolina (the “Ahoskie plant”) in December 2010 and constructed the Ahoskie plant there in less than one year, commencing operations in November 2011. Through an expansion completed in June 2012, we increased the plant’s production from 260,000 MTPY to 350,000 MTPY and have made further improvements to increase production to 410,000 MTPY of wood pellets.
Production from the Ahoskie plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.
Amory
We purchased a wood pellet production plant in Amory, Mississippi (the “Amory plant”) in August 2010. The Amory plant initially consisted of three pellet mills producing wood pellets at a rate of 41,500 MTPY. Through operational improvements and installation of a fourth pellet mill, the Amory plant currently produces 115,000 MTPY of wood pellets.
Production from the Amory plant is transported by barge to the Mobile terminal.
Cottondale
Our sponsor acquired a wood pellet production plant in Cottondale, Florida (the “Cottondale plant”) in January 2015 and contributed it to us in April 2015. We have undertaken several expansions and process improvements at the Cottondale plant since acquiring it from our sponsor and have increased its production capacity from 720,000 MTPY to 780,000 MTPY of wood pellets since 2016.
Wood pellets produced by the Cottondale plant are transported approximately 50 miles by short-line rail to a warehouse that currently can store up to 32,000 metric tons (“MT”) of wood pellet inventory at the Panama City terminal.
Greenwood
Our sponsor acquired a wood pellet production plant in Greenwood, South Carolina (the “Greenwood plant”) in February 2018 and contributed it to us in July 2020. Procurement and detailed engineering activities to expand the Greenwood plant’s production capacity to 600,000 MTPY are underway and we expect the expansion to be completed by year-end 2021.
Production from the Greenwood plant is transported by rail to the Wilmington terminal.
Hamlet
In April 2019, we acquired from our sponsor all of the Class B units of Enviva Wilmington Holdings, LLC (the “Hamlet JV,” and such acquisition, the “Hamlet Drop-Down”). The Hamlet JV owns a wood pellet production plant in Hamlet, North Carolina (the “Hamlet plant”). We are the managing member of the Hamlet JV, which is partially owned by John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) and certain of its affiliates (collectively, where applicable, “John Hancock”). We accounted for the Hamlet JV as a consolidated subsidiary, not as a joint venture, following the Hamlet Drop-Down. For more information regarding our rights and obligations with respect to the Hamlet JV, see Note 17, Partners’ Capital—Hamlet JV.
Production from the Hamlet plant is transported by rail to our Wilmington terminal.
Northampton
Our wood pellet production plant in Northampton, North Carolina (the “Northampton plant”) was constructed based on the Ahoskie plant design, utilizing the same major equipment suppliers. After a ramp period for the expansion project, the Northampton plant’s production capacity is expected to increase by 200,000 MTPY to 750,000 MTPY by the end of 2021.
Production from the Northampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.
Sampson
Our wood pellet production plant in Sampson, North Carolina (the “Sampson plant”), which was built based on our templated design and which we acquired from our sponsor’s first development joint venture in December 2016, commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2016.
Production from the Sampson plant is transported by truck to our Wilmington terminal.
Southampton
We acquired a wood pellet production plant in Southampton County, Virginia (the “Southampton plant”) from our sponsor’s first development joint venture in December 2015. The Southampton plant is a build-and-copy replica of our Northampton plant. After a ramp period for the expansion project, the Southampton plant’s production capacity is expected to increase by 200,000 MTPY to 760,000 MTPY by the end of 2021.
Production from the Southampton plant is transported by truck to our Chesapeake terminal.
Waycross
In July 2020, we acquired a wood pellet production plant in Waycross, Georgia with a production capacity of approximately 800,000 MTPY (the “Waycross plant”).
Production from the Waycross plant is transported by rail to the Savannah terminal.
Wood Fiber Procurement and Sustainability
Our fleet of production plants is sited in robust fiber baskets in the Southeast United States that sustainably support our growth operations with low-grade fiber. Our sites minimize wood fiber procurement and logistics costs, which provides a structural cost of goods advantage over many other fiber baskets around the world. Although “stumpage,” the industry term for the amount of consideration paid for fiber, constitutes a small portion of our total cost of delivered products, wood fiber procurement is a vital function of our business and cost-effective access to wood fiber is an important factor in our pricing stability.
Wood fiber is a unique energy commodity in that, in resource basins like the Southern United States where we operate, more wood fiber grows each year than is harvested, meaning that the commodity is a negative depletion resource. Over the period from 1953 to 2015, the amount of timberland acreage in the U.S. South remained stable; however, during this same period wood fiber inventory stored in Southern forests increased by 108%. Between 2011, the year in which we opened our first wood pellet production plant, and 2019, forest inventory in our overall supply base increased by more than 370 million MT, or 18%.
Because wood fiber is approximately 50% water at the time of harvest, it has a limited economically efficient distribution radius of roughly 75 miles. The combination of consistent excess supply over demand for a commodity that is not cost-effective to transport to new demand regions means that this stranded natural resource experiences structurally stable long-term pricing: during the period from 2000 to 2018, the delivered cost of fiber in North Carolina, one of our primary sourcing areas, increased at a modest 1.6% compound annual growth rate with limited annual volatility.
We and our customers are subject to stringent requirements regarding the sustainability of the fuels they procure. In addition to our internal sustainability policies and initiatives like our Responsible Sourcing Policy, our wood fiber procurement is conducted in accordance with leading forest certification standards. Our fiber supply chains are routinely audited by independent third parties. We maintain multiple forest certifications including: Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) Chain of Custody, FSC® Controlled Wood, Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC™) Chain of Custody, Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI®) Fiber Sourcing and SFI® Chain of Custody. We have obtained independent third-party certification for all of our plants to the applicable Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) Standards.
Our wood fiber demand is complementary to, rather than in competition with, demand for high-grade wood for use by most other forest-related industries, such as lumber and furniture making. For example, improvements in the U.S. housing construction industry typically increase the demand for construction-quality lumber, which in turn increases the available supply of the low-cost pulpwood and mill residues that we use in wood pellet production. By using commercial thinnings and byproducts as raw materials, wood pellet production also indirectly supports other forest-related industries as well as the sustainable management of commercial forests.
We make wood pellets only with low-grade or leftover wood. Across our combined supply base, approximately 10% of the volume of harvested wood is purchased by us and other wood pellet producers, which represents an estimated 4% of the total stumpage value of harvested timber. Our sponsor has created a first-of-its kind, proprietary Track and Trace® program to track the origin and characteristics of fiber that we use, and we publish this information, providing unprecedented transparency into our fiber sourcing activities.
The wood fiber used for wood pellet production predominantly is comprised of:
•low-grade wood fiber: trees or wood that are unsuitable for or rejected by the sawmilling and lumber industries because of small size, defects (e.g. crooked or knotty), disease, or pest infestation;
•tops and limbs: the parts of trees that cannot be processed into lumber;
•commercial thinnings: harvests that promote the growth of higher value timber by removing weaker or deformed trees to reduce competition for water, nutrients, and sunlight; and
•mill residues: chips, sawdust and other wood industry byproducts.
Demand for the non-merchantable fiber, waste products or byproducts that we use is generally low because they have few competing uses, in part because they cannot be transported cost-effectively. The tops, limbs and other low-grade wood fiber we purchase would otherwise generally be left on the forest floor, impeding reforestation, or burned. Wood pellet production provides a profitable use for the residues from sawmill and furniture industries and also for the trees that are thinned to support the growth of higher-value lumber-grade trees. U.S. demand for such low-grade wood fiber historically emerged from the pulp and paper industry. However, due to the decline in demand from paper and pulp, many landowners lack commercial markets for this wood fiber. Wood pellet producers help fill the gap.
As a result of the fragmented nature of tract ownership, we procure raw materials from hundreds of landowners, loggers, and timber industry participants, with no individual landowner representing a material fraction of any of our plants’ needs. Our wood fiber is procured under a variety of arrangements, including (1) logging contracts for the thinnings, pulpwood and other unmerchandised low-grade fiber, (2) in-woods chipping contracts and (3) contracts with timber dealers. Via our sponsor’s proprietary Track & Trace® system, we maintain traceability of the primary wood that is delivered to us directly from forests. Any supplier delivering wood to one of our plants must first share the details about the forest characteristics of the tract from which the wood is sourced with our forestry staff so we can verify that it meets our strict sustainability criteria. Our supplier contracts require a certification that the relevant tract information has been entered into our database before wood may be delivered directly from a particular tract. We summarize all such tract information periodically and publish tract-level details on our website. During 2020, we sourced wood fiber from approximately 363 suppliers, including brokers who source from landowners growing both hardwoods and softwoods and other suppliers. The diversity of our supply base and our facilities’ advantaged siting enables us to benefit from more reliable deliveries, at a lower cost, than others in our region or industry.
Plant Operations
Our plants receive wood fiber in both stem-length and chip form. When this raw material is delivered by truck from our suppliers, it is scaled for weight, checked for quality and recorded consistent with our Track & Trace® system and Responsible Sourcing Policy requirements at the scale house at each of our plants. Each truck is then unloaded in a particular location in each respective plant’s woodyard based on the form and species (generally hardwood or softwood) of the raw material. Stem-length wood is stacked by radial or portal cranes and chips are piled, typically through automated conveyors to be reclaimed later for use. Stem-length wood is debarked prior to processing, providing fuel for each plant’s drying systems.
Following debarking, stem-length wood is size-reduced through a disc chipper, the chip product from which is co-mingled with delivered chips. The production process begins by mixing a specific formula of species and form factors of chips and metering them into a set of green hammer mills, which perform primary sizing. The now-smaller chips are fed into a green chip bin and metered into a rotary kiln drier, where drying heat is provided by a biomass and bark-fueled furnace. Dried chips are fed from the drier to the secondary sizing process island, which comprises a combination of screening and dry-hammermilling to further size-reduce the chips. This dry, further size-reduced flour or meal is stored in a dry storage silo and conveyed to ripening bins which further homogenize moisture prior to pelletizing. To the extent sawdust or other residuals are available, it is also size-reduced and combined with the processed wood fiber at this point in the process. The meal is metered into a series of pellet mills where hydraulic pressure extrudes the fiber into wood pellets. The pressure and temperature of the pelleting process activate natural lignin present in the wood which acts as a natural binder and finishes the pellet with a shiny exterior. The pellets are gravity-fed into large coolers which utilize counter-current air flow to reduce pellet temperature and moisture. Once cool, the pellets, then averaging approximately 5-7% moisture, are screened to reduce entrained dust and then conveyed to finished goods silos prior to being loaded onto trucks, railcars or barges depending on the facility.
Our larger plants are staffed by approximately 85-100 employees including operators, maintenance technicians, quality leads and area, shift and operations supervisors. Plants operate two shifts per day, with four employee teams operating either on an alternating three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, or alternating four days on, four days off, basis, with a rotation between day shift and night shift periodically. Plant management consists of a plant manager, operations manager, maintenance manager, quality manager, human capital manager and an environmental health and safety manager, complemented by wood procurement, sustainability, accounting and engineering personnel.
Maintenance activities at the plant include planned and preventive maintenance as well as refurbishment of tools, dies, screens and hammers for key process equipment. The plants receive power from local utilities, have minimal process water requirements and limited exposure to fossil fuel volatility. The furnace burns wood in the form of bark and fuel chips as the source of heat for the dryer to evaporate moisture. Natural gas or propane is used as the energy source for emissions control equipment onsite like regenerative thermal oxidizers and a small amount of diesel is used in mobile equipment on each site. Very little waste besides office refuse leaves the plant as the by-product ash from the furnace operations is usually desirable as a fertilizer and is land-applied by local farmers.
To-Port Logistics and Port Infrastructure 
Each of our plants is located near multiple truck, rail, river and ocean transportation access points. We also have inland waterway access and rail access at the Chesapeake, Wilmington, Savannah and Panama City terminals. Our multi-year fixed-cost contracts with third-party logistics providers allow for long-term visibility into our to-port logistics cost structure.
The wood pellets produced at our plants are stored, terminaled and shipped to our customers, principally in the U.K., Europe and increasingly in Japan. Limited deep-water, dry-bulk terminaling assets exist in the Southeastern United States, and very few of them have the appropriate handling and storage infrastructure necessary for receiving, storing and loading wood pellets. In response to such scarcity, we have vertically integrated our Mid-Atlantic operations downstream to encompass finished product logistics and storage. As a largely fixed cost and capital intensive piece of the value chain, we believe our port infrastructure allows us to ship incremental product from our regional plants at a fraction of the cost of our competitors. Management of port terminal infrastructure is also a key element in reducing distribution-related costs as it allows us to manage the arrival and loading of vessels. Additionally, we are able to improve our cost position by maintaining a dedicated berth where pellets from our Mid-Atlantic region plants have priority and equipment with sufficient load-rate capabilities to turn around vessels within the allotted time windows.
In addition to terminaling wood pellets from our production plants, we will, on occasion, provide terminaling services for third- and related-party wood pellet producers as well as for owners of other dry-bulk commodities.
Port Operations
We acquired the Chesapeake terminal in January 2011 and converted it into a dry-bulk terminal. The Chesapeake terminal receives, stores and loads wood pellets for export and serves as the shipment point for products produced at our Ahoskie, Northampton and Southampton plants. The Chesapeake terminal accommodates Handysize, Supramax and Panamax-sized vessels, and has a 200-car rail yard adjacent to a Norfolk Southern track, a loading/unloading system that accommodates deliveries by truck, rail and barge and a highly automated conveying system. In May 2011, we erected a 157-foot tall, 175-foot wide storage dome that receives, stores and loads up to 45,000 MT of wood pellets. In April 2013, we placed into operation a second storage dome at the site to add an additional 45,000 MT of storage.
The Chesapeake terminal’s storage and loading capacity is more than adequate to store and facilitate the loading of the wood pellets produced at our Ahoskie, Northampton and Southampton plants, and its location decreases our customers’ transportation time and costs. Efficiently positioned near our Ahoskie, Northampton and Southampton plants, the Chesapeake terminal delivers up to a three- to four-day European shipping advantage compared to other Southern or Gulf Coast ports. In addition, because we own the Chesapeake terminal, we enjoy preferential berth access and loading, which minimizes costs of shipping and logistics without the need for excess storage. Our ownership and operation of this terminal enable us to control shipment of the production of our Mid-Atlantic region plants that it serves.
Wood pellets produced at our Sampson, Hamlet and Greenwood plants are terminaled at our Wilmington terminal. The Wilmington terminal accommodates Handysize, Supramax and Panamax-sized vessels, and has a receiving system that accommodates deliveries by truck and rail, a highly automated conveying system and two wood pellet storage domes with capacities of 45,000 MT each. The Wilmington terminal’s storage and loading capacity is more than adequate to store and facilitate the loading of wood pellets produced at our Sampson, Hamlet and Greenwood plants and its location decreases transportation time and costs through the entire supply chain. We benefit from preferential berth access and loading at our Wilmington terminal, which minimizes costs of shipping and logistics without need for excess storage.
Wood pellets produced at our Amory plant are transported by barge to the Mobile terminal for storage, handling and export pursuant to a short-term services agreement. The Mobile terminal is a privately owned and maintained deep-water, multi-berth terminal that operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week and is the fleeting and loading point for production from our Amory plant. The Amory plant is sited along a major inland waterway that makes transportation to the Mobile terminal easy and efficient, thereby reducing emissions and costs. Our ability to store our wood pellets in barges provides a capital-light, flexible solution that accommodates the storage needs of the Amory plant.
Wood pellets from our Cottondale plant are transported by short‑line rail to the Panama City terminal, where we store up to 32,000 MT of wood pellet inventory in a warehouse at Port Panama City. Production from the Cottondale plant is received, stored and loaded under a long‑term terminal services agreement with the Panama City Port Authority and a stevedoring contract, each of which runs through September 2023 and may be extended by us for an additional five-year period.
Wood pellets produced by our Waycross plant are transported by rail to the Savannah terminal, which has two wood pellet storage domes with a combined storage capacity of 50,000 MT, for storage, handling and export pursuant to a lease and associated terminal services agreement that are effective through 2028.
Please read Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” for more information regarding our plants, terminals and other long‑lived assets.
Our Contracts
We refer to the structure of our long-term sales contracts as “take-or-pay” because they include a firm obligation of the customer to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions for us to be compensated in the event of a customer’s failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or for termination of a contract by a customer. Our long-term sales contracts typically provide for annual inflation-based adjustments or price escalators. Certain of our long-term sales contracts also contain provisions that allow us to increase or decrease the volume of product that we deliver by a percentage of the base annual volume, as well as cost pass-through mechanisms related to stumpage, fuel or transportation costs (including pricing fluctuations in bunker fuel) and price adjustments based on actual product specifications. In addition, many of our long-term sales contracts provide for cost recovery and sharing arrangements in connection with certain changes in law or sustainability requirements as well as payments to us in the case of their termination as a result of such changes. In order to mitigate volatility in our shipping costs, we have entered into fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers to form a shipping portfolio matching the terms and volumes of our sales contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping.
We also have entered into several other contracts that have smaller off-take quantities than the contracts described above. We continue to diversify our customer base; however, our largest customer accounted for 40% of our product sales in 2020 and, based on our current contract backlog, our largest customer will account for 20% of our product sales in 2025.
In some cases, we may purchase shipments of product from third-party suppliers and resell them in back-to-back transactions. We determined that we are the principal in such transactions because we control the pellets prior to transferring them to the customer and therefore we recognize the related revenue on a gross basis in product sales.
In some instances, a customer may request to cancel, defer or accelerate a shipment, in which case we seek to optimize our position by selling or purchasing the subject shipment to or from another party, including in some cases a related party, either within our contracted off‑take portfolio or as an independent transaction in the spot market. In most instances, the original customer pays us a fee, including reimbursement of any incremental costs, which is included in other revenue. Other revenue also includes certain sales and marketing, scheduling, sustainability, consultation, shipping and risk management services (collectively, the “Commercial Services”) that are outside of the scope of an existing take-or-pay off-take contract.
We also provide terminaling services for third- and related-party wood pellet producers as well as for owners of other dry-bulk commodities.
The following chart presents information relating to our and our sponsor’s long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts:
____________________________________________
(1)    Represents the Partnership’s sales in 2020.
(2)    As of February 1, 2021, excluding volumes under the contracts between long-term off-take customers and our sponsor.
(3)    As of February 1, 2021, includes all volumes under the firm and contingent off-take contracts held by us and our sponsor. Although we expect to have the opportunity to acquire these contracts from our sponsor there can be no guarantee that we will acquire these, or any, contracts from our sponsor.
With our existing long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts, all of the current production capacity of our production plants is fully contracted through 2025. As our current off-take contracts expire, we will seek to re-contract our capacity with a combination of renewals with existing customers, the assumption of additional contracts from our sponsor and the entry into contracts with new customers.
Contracted backlog
As of February 1, 2021, we had approximately $14.6 billion of product sales backlog for firm and contingent contracted product sales to our long-term off-take customers with a total weighted-average remaining term of 12.8 years. Contracted backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contracts. Contracted future product sales denominated in foreign currencies, excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, are 
included in U.S. Dollars at February 1, 2021 forward rates. The contracted backlog includes forward prices including inflation, foreign currency and commodity prices. The amount also includes the effects of related foreign currency derivative contracts.
Our expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of February 1, 2021 is as follows (in millions):

Period from February 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 | $ | 1,033 
Year ending December 31, 2022 | 1,274 | 
Year ending December 31, 2023 and thereafter | 12,284 | 
Total product sales contracted backlog | $ | 14,591

Assuming all volumes under the firm and contingent off-take contracts held by our sponsor were included with our product sales backlog for firm and contingent contracted product sales, the total weighted-average remaining term as of February 1, 2021 would increase to 14.0 years and product sales contracted backlog would increase to $19.9 billion as follows (in millions):

Period from February 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 | $ | 1,032 
Year ending December 31, 2022 | 1,325 | 
Year ending December 31, 2023 and thereafter | 17,537 | 
Total product sales contracted backlog | $ | 19,894

Included in the product sales contracted backlog above are $2.9 billion of contingent contracts held by our sponsor.
Industry Overview 
Our product, utility-grade wood pellets, is used as a substitute for coal in both dedicated and co-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants. It enables major power, heat or combined heat and power generators (“generators”) to profitably generate electricity and heat in a manner that reduces the overall cost of compliance with certain mandatory greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions limits and renewable energy targets while also allowing countries to diversify their sources of electricity supply.
Unlike intermittent sources of renewable generation like wind and solar power, wood pellet-fired plants are capable of meeting baseload electricity demand and are dispatchable (that is, power output can be switched on or off or adjusted based on demand). As a result, utilities and major generators in Europe, Asia and other areas have made and continue to make long-term, profitable investments in power plant conversions and new builds of generating assets that either co-fire wood pellets with coal or are fully dedicated wood pellet-fired plants. Such developments help generators maintain and increase baseload generating capacity and comply with binding climate change regulations and other emissions reduction targets.
The capital costs required to convert a coal plant to co-fire biomass, or to burn biomass exclusively, are a fraction of the capital costs associated with implementing offshore wind and most other renewable technologies. Furthermore, the relatively quick process of converting coal-fired plants to biomass-fired generation can be an attractive benefit for generators whose generation assets are no longer viable as coal plants due to the expiration of operating permits, regulatory phase-out of coal-fired power generation, the introduction of taxes or other restrictions on fossil fuel usage or emissions of GHGs and other pollutants.
There also continues to be significant growth in the European and Asian demand for wood pellets as a preferred fuel source and renewable alternative to fossil fuels for district heating loops, for heating homes and commercial buildings and for the production of process heat for industrial sites. Increasingly, wood pellets are also being sought as a raw material input for bio-based substitutes for traditional fossil fuel-based fuels and chemicals. As these markets further develop, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to serve this growing material demand beyond our current product sales backlog.
Competition 
We compete with other utility-grade wood pellet producers for long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with major power generation customers and trading houses. Competition in our industry is based on the price, quality and consistency of the wood pellets produced, the reliability of wood pellet deliveries and the producer’s ability to verify and document, through customer and third-party audits, that its wood pellets meet the regulatory sustainability obligations of a particular customer.
Most of the world’s current wood pellet production plants are owned by small, private companies, with few companies owning or operating multiple plants. Few companies have the scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure necessary to supply utility-grade wood pellets under large, long-term off-take contracts with generators.
We are the largest producer by production capacity, and consider other companies with comparable scale, technical expertise or commercial infrastructure to be our competitors, including AS Graanul Invest, Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., Drax Biomass Inc., Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, Highland Pellets LLC and Pacific BioEnergy Corporation.
Our Relationship with Our Sponsor
The Riverstone Funds became the majority owners of our sponsor in March 2010. In 2020, following a reorganization, certain affiliates of Riverstone, Riverstone Echo Continuation Holdings, L.P. and Riverstone Echo Rollover Holdings, L.P. became the majority owners of our sponsor.
We entered into a purchase rights agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to provide us with a right of first offer to purchase any wood pellet production plant or deep‑water marine terminal that it, its subsidiaries or any other entity that it controls, owns and proposes to sell (each, a “ROFO Asset”) for a five-year period. Pursuant to an amendment, the term of the purchase rights agreement was extended to May 2021 and will automatically renew on an annual basis unless either party provides notice of termination within 60 days prior to the end of the then-current term.
We will have 30 days following receipt of notice of our sponsor entity’s intention to sell a ROFO Asset to propose an offer for the ROFO Asset. If we submit an offer, our sponsor will negotiate with us exclusively and in good faith to enter into a letter of intent or definitive documentation for the purchase of the ROFO Asset on mutually acceptable terms. If we are unable to agree to terms within 45 days, our sponsor entity will have 150 days to enter into definitive documentation with a third party purchaser on terms that are, in the good faith judgment of our sponsor entity selling such ROFO Assets, superior to the most recent offer proposed by us.
We expect to continue to pursue the acquisition of such assets from our sponsor to the extent they are supported by long-term off-take contracts with creditworthy counterparties and have long useful lives, stable cost positions and advantaged locations.
Our sponsor owns approximately 34% of our common units and 100% of our General Partner. Our sponsor owns all of our incentive distribution rights, which entitle our sponsor to increasing percentages of our cash distributions above certain targets. As a result, our sponsor is incentivized to facilitate our access to accretive acquisition and organic growth opportunities, including those pursuant to the purchase rights agreement.
Our sponsor is developing and constructing certain wood pellet production and terminaling assets in the Southeastern United States. Although we expect to continue to have the opportunity to acquire assets, including from our sponsor, our sponsor may not complete their development projects, and our sponsor may not decide to sell assets or completed development projects to us.
Our Sponsor’s Assets and Development Projects
Our sponsor is constructing a wood pellet production plant in Lucedale, Mississippi and a deep-water marine terminal in Pascagoula, Mississippi. In addition, our sponsor is developing a wood pellet production plant in Epes, Alabama along with other sites in Mississippi and Alabama. Our sponsor employs a “build and copy” approach to constructing production plants and terminals, allowing synergies of common processes and operational knowledge. We expect to have the opportunity to acquire assets and off-take contracts from our sponsor.
Governmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing matters including protection of the environment and natural resources, occupational health and safety and the release or discharge of materials into the environment, including air emissions. Such laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits, limit or avoid certain operational practices and incur costs for compliance or remediation. Failure to comply with such laws may also result in substantial liabilities, including possible fines and penalties, for unpermitted emissions or discharges from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.
Moreover, the global trend in environmental regulation is towards increasingly broad and stringent requirements for activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re‑interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Although we monitor environmental requirements closely and budget for the expected costs, actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate spending. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose strict joint and several liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released, potentially resulting in significant costs and liabilities for remediation of resulting damage to property, natural resources or persons. Although 
we believe that our competitors face similar environmental requirements, market factors may prevent us from passing on any increased costs to our customers. Additionally, although we believe that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the current levels of regulation will continue in the future.
The following summarizes some of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations, the failure to comply with which could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and state and local laws and regulations that implement and add to CAA requirements, regulate the emission of air pollutants from our facilities. The CAA and state and local laws and regulations impose significant monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for these emissions. These laws and regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit emission limits, and in certain cases utilize specific equipment or technologies to control and measure emissions. Obtaining these permits can be both costly and time intensive and has the potential to delay opening of new plants or significant expansion of existing plants; moreover, complying with these permits, including satisfying testing requirements, can be costly and time-intensive. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements may cause us to face fines, penalties or injunctive orders in connection with air pollutant emissions from our operations.
The CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including, in some cases, Title V air permits. In certain cases, the CAA requires us to incur capital expenditures to install air pollution control devices at our facilities. We are also required to control fugitive emissions from our operations and may face fines, penalties or injunctive orders in connection with fugitive emissions. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial administrative, operating and capital expenditures to maintain compliance with CAA requirements that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases
Our operations are subject to limited direct regulation with respect to emissions of GHGs. For example, at this time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) requires certain large facilities to undergo CAA pre-construction review and obtain operating permits for their GHG emissions. Our operations are also indirectly affected by regulations regarding the carbon treatment of biomass. Several jurisdictions to which we ship our product have imposed regulations on the characterization of biomass as a carbon-neutral fuel, and any change that imposes more stringent regulations on the characterization of biomass as carbon-neutral could negatively impact demand for our products or require us to incur additional costs to achieve such characterization of our products. For more information, see our risk factor titled “Changes in the treatment of biomass could adversely impact our business.” Finally, scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as sea-level rise, increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, including forest fires. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Safety and Maintenance
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. OSHA regulations impose various requirements, including with respect to training, policies and procedures and maintenance. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standards in the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards for combustible dust require our facilities to incorporate pollution control equipment such as cyclones, baghouses and electrostatic precipitators to minimize regulated emissions. Our deep-water marine terminals must also adhere to Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard regulations regarding physical security and emergency response plans. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste and wastewater regulations; nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that serious accidents will not occur in the future.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations. The cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher in the winter months because of increases in the cost of delivered raw materials, primarily due to a reduction in accessibility during cold and wet 
weather conditions. Our raw materials typically have higher moisture content during this period, resulting in a lower product yield; moreover, the cost of drying wood fiber increases during periods of lower ambient temperatures.
The increase in demand for power and heat during the winter months drives greater customer demand for wood pellets. As some of our wood pellet supply to our customers is sourced from third-party purchases, we may experience higher wood pellet costs and a reduction in our gross margin during the winter months.
Human Capital
We do not have any employees. We are party to management services agreements (the “MSAs”) with Enviva Management Company, pursuant to which Enviva Management Company provides us with the employees, management and services necessary for the operation of our business. As of December 31, 2020, Enviva Management Company had 1,135 employees. We refer to the employees of Enviva Management Company as our employees in this annual report. Please read Part II, Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence—Other Transactions with Related Persons—Management Services Agreement” for more information regarding our MSAs with Enviva Management Company.
