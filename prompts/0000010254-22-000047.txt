Recent Developments
Bighorn Agreement
On January 30, 2022, Earthstone, Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Earthstone (“EEH”), and Bighorn Asset Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Bighorn”), as seller, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Bighorn Agreement”) that was previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2022. Pursuant to the Bighorn Agreement, EEH will acquire (the “Bighorn Acquisition”) interests in oil and gas leases and related property of Bighorn located in the Midland Basin in West Texas, for a purchase price (the “Bighorn Purchase Price”) of $770 million in cash and 6,808,511 shares of Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share of Earthstone (the “Class A Common Stock”). The Bighorn Purchase Price is subject to customary purchase price adjustments with an effective date of January 1, 2022. In connection with the Bighorn Agreement, EEH deposited $50 million in cash into a third-party escrow account as a deposit pursuant to the Bighorn Agreement, which will be credited against the Bighorn Purchase Price upon closing of the Bighorn Acquisition. The Bighorn Acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.
Credit Agreement 
On January 30, 2022, Earthstone, EEH, as Borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) as Administrative Agent, the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) and the guarantors party thereto entered into an amended and restated Fifth Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement dated November 21, 2019, by and among EEH, as Borrower, Earthstone, as Parent, Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, as Syndication Agent, Truist Bank, Citizens Bank, N.A., KeyBank National Association, U.S. Bank National Association, Fifth 
Third Bank, PNC Bank, National Association, and Bank of America, N.A., as Documentation Agents, and the Lenders party thereto (together with all amendments or other modifications, the “Credit Agreement”). Among other things, the Amendment increased the borrowing base and corresponding elected commitments from $650 million to $825 million upon the closing (“Chisholm Closing”) of that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as December 15, 2021 (the “Chisholm Agreement”) by and among Earthstone, EEH, Chisholm Energy Operating, LLC (“OpCo”) and Chisholm Energy Agent, Inc. (“Agent” and collectively with OpCo, “Chisholm”); provides that upon the closing of the Bighorn Acquisition, the borrowing base and corresponding elected commitments would increase to $1.325 billion, unless Earthstone completes an unsecured senior notes offering (“Notes Offering”) prior to the closing of the Bighorn Acquisition in which case the elected commitments will be reduced by the amount of the net proceeds from a Notes Offering up to $500 million; provides for an increase in interest rates by 0.50% in the event a Notes Offering has not been completed prior to the closing of the Bighorn Acquisition; provides mechanics relating to the transition from LIBOR to a benchmark replacement rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), to be effective contemporaneously with the effectiveness of the Amendment on January 30, 2022; adds certain hedging requirements relating to anticipated oil and natural gas production of the properties to be acquired pursuant to the Bighorn Acquisition; adjusts some financial covenants; redefines the limitations on certain restricted payments the Borrower may make; and made certain administrative changes to the Credit Agreement.
Securities Purchase Agreement 
As previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2022, on January 30, 2022 Earthstone entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with EnCap Capital Energy Fund XI, L.P. (“EnCap Fund XI”), an affiliate of EnCap Investments L.P. (“EnCap”), and Cypress Investments, LLC, a fund managed by Post Oak Energy Capital, LP (“Post Oak” and collectively with EnCap Fund XI, the “Investors”) to sell, in a private placement (the “Private Placement”), 280,000 shares of newly authorized Series A convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share of Earthstone (the “Preferred Stock”), each share of which will be convertible into 90.0900900900901 shares of Class A Common Stock for anticipated gross proceeds of $280.0 million, at a price of $1,000.00 per share of Preferred Stock (or $11.10 per share of Class A Common Stock on an as-converted basis). The Private Placement is contingent upon the closing of the Bighorn Acquisition. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Stock to partially fund the Bighorn Acquisition. The Preferred Stock will convert automatically on the 20th calendar day after Earthstone mails a definitive information statement to holders of its Class A Common Stock and Class B common stock, $0.001 par value per share of Earthstone (“Class B Common Stock” and collectively, with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”) notifying them that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock have consented to the conversion feature of the Preferred Stock and the issuance of Class A Common Stock upon conversion of the Preferred Stock. As of January 30, 2022, Earthstone had received written consent for the conversion feature of the Preferred Stock and the issuance of the Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock from stockholders representing more than 50% of Earthstone’s outstanding shares of Common Stock. As of the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, EnCap and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 46.5% of the outstanding voting power of Earthstone. Two members of the board of directors of Earthstone (the “Board”) are employed by EnCap. The Securities Purchase Agreement and the Private Placement were evaluated and unanimously approved by the audit committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board and unanimously approved by the Board. 
Chisholm Acquisition

Eagle Ford Acquisitions
During the second quarter of 2021, we acquired working interests in certain assets we operate in southern Gonzales County, Texas (the “Eagle Ford Acquisitions”) from four separate sellers for approximately $45.2 million in cash. We funded the Eagle Ford Acquisitions with cash on hand and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. The effective date of the Eagle Ford Acquisitions was April 1, 2021. One of the four sellers was a related party entity. See further discussion in Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 14. Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
IRM Acquisition
On January 7, 2021, Earthstone, EEH, Independence Resources Holdings, LLC (“Independence”), and Independence Resources Manager, LLC (“Independence Manager” and collectively with Independence, the “Seller”) consummated the transactions contemplated in the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated December 17, 2020 (the “IRM Purchase Agreement”) that was previously reported on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 22, 2020. At the closing of the IRM Purchase Agreement, EEH acquired (the “IRM Acquisition”) all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Independence and Independence Manager for aggregate consideration consisting of: (i) cash of approximately $140.5 million and (ii) 12,719,594 shares of Class A Common Stock. 
Our Properties
As operator, across the majority of our acreage in the Midland and Delaware Basins, we manage and are able to directly influence development and production of our operated properties. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with drilling and completion activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work on improving drilling and completion processes, operating costs, production rates and reserves. Our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price and cost fluctuations. Our status as an operator has allowed us to pursue the development of undeveloped acreage, further develop existing properties and generate new projects.
As is common in our industry, we selectively participate in drilling and developmental activities in non-operated properties. Decisions to participate in non-operated properties are dependent upon the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators.
As of December 31, 2021, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were approximately 147,587 MBoe based on the reserve report prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), our independent petroleum engineers. Based on this report, at December 31, 2021, our estimated proved reserve quantities were approximately 41% oil, 32% natural gas and 26% NGLs with 63% of those reserves classified as proved developed.
As a result of the Chisholm Acquisition, we added an estimated 54.3 MBoe of proved reserves which were approximately 64% oil, 19% natural gas and 17% NGLs. 
Midland Basin
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 102,100 net acres in the core of the Midland Basin that are highly contiguous on a project-by-project basis which allow us to drill multi-well pads. Of this acreage, 94% is operated and 6% is non-operated. We hold an approximate 96% working interest in our operated acreage and an approximate 39% working interest in our non-operated acreage. As of December 31, 2021, we had interests in approximately 891 gross / 822 net vertical and 298 gross / 219 net horizontal producing wells, of which we operate 804 vertical and 218 horizontal wells. With 474 potential gross horizontal drilling locations (299 operated / 175 non-operated) in the Midland Basin as of December 31, 2021, we are focused on developmental drilling and completion operations in the area.
We continue to pursue acreage trades and bolt-on acreage acquisitions in the Midland Basin with the intent of increasing our operated acreage and drilling inventory, drilling and completing longer laterals and realizing greater operating efficiencies.
Delaware Basin
Upon the consummation of the Chisholm Acquisition on February 15, 2022, we acquired approximately 36,100 net acres located in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico with approximately 85% held by production and approximately 92% operated. We now have interests in approximately 333 gross / 169 net producing wells, of which we operate 190 gross / 149 net producing wells. We have identified approximately 414 gross / 237 net potential drilling locations in this acreage.
Eagle Ford Trend
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 12,700 net leasehold acres in the Eagle Ford Trend, primarily in the crude oil window in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes counties which include 37 gross / 32 net operated producing wells and 83 gross / 36 net non-operated wells.
Our Business Strategy 
We believe that the recent trend of consolidation in the industry environment will continue and will result in further consolidation opportunities. We continue to pursue value-accretive and scale-enhancing consolidation opportunities, as we believe we are in a position to operate effectively despite volatility in commodity prices. We are focusing our attention on acquisition and corporate merger opportunities that would increase the scale of our operations in a financially accretive manner, without materially altering our debt metrics in relation to our cash flows and capital structure. In addition, we believe that our recent track record of successful consolidation will create further consolidation opportunities for us based on our increased scale, financial strength and success at acquiring and integrating assets in a financially prudent manner. At the same time, we will seek to block up acreage in the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin that would allow for longer horizontal laterals and should therefore provide for higher economic returns. In summary, we believe we are well qualified to be a consolidator which would increase the scale of our operations and add value to our shareholders.
Our current business strategy is to focus on the economic development of our existing acreage, increase our acreage and horizontal well locations in the Midland and Delaware Basins and increase stockholder value through the following:
•developing our acreage and profitably growing our production while seeking to maximize operating cash flows;
•operating our properties efficiently and continuing to improve our operating margins;
•deploying capital efficiently by drilling multi-well pads, reducing drilling times and increasing completions per day;
•leveraging both our increased operational and financial scale to achieve economies related to such scale where available;
•operating our assets in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner;
•continuing to hedge commodity prices as opportunities arise;
•pursuing value-accretive acquisition and corporate merger opportunities, which could increase the scale and profitability of our operations;
•maximizing operating margins and corporate level cash flows by minimizing operating and overhead costs;
•expanding our acreage positions and drilling inventory in our primary areas of interest through acquisitions and farm-in opportunities, with an emphasis on operated positions;
•blocking up acreage to allow for longer horizontal lateral drilling locations which provide higher economic returns; and
•maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.
Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths are beneficial in achieving our business goals:
•history of successful asset acquisitions and merger transactions;
•extensive horizontal development potential in two of the most oil rich basins of the United States;
•experienced management team with substantial technical and operational expertise;
•ability to attract technical personnel with experience in our core area of operations;
•operating control over the majority of our production and development activities;
•financial discipline;
•conservative balance sheet;
•commitment to cost efficient operations;
•a management team that is well known and respected throughout the industry; and
•ability to efficiently integrate acquisitions, allowing us to improve operating margins, as well as reducing lead time on additional acquisition opportunities.
COVID-19
Despite the recoveries in commodity prices, recent surges from COVID-19 variants continue to impact the global economy, disrupt global supply chains and may create significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, is uncertain and depends on various factors, including how the pandemic and measures taken in response to its impact on demand for oil and natural gas, the availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to our ability to operate our properties and the impact of potential governmental restrictions on travel, transports and operations. There is uncertainty around the extent and duration of disruption, including any resurgence, and we expect that the longer the duration of any such disruption, the greater the adverse impact may be on our business. 
Operational Status
As a producer of oil, natural gas and NGLs, we are recognized as an essential business under various federal, state and local regulations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have continued to operate as permitted under these regulations while taking mitigation efforts and steps to protect the health and safety of our employees. The safety of our employees is paramount, and we have emphasized the respective guidelines to support our mitigation efforts. Our field personnel are performing their job 
responsibilities and practicing mitigation guidelines with no issues to date. While our non-field personnel returned to the office in mid-2020 and were fully in the office during 2021 with minimal disruptions, we remain flexible to working remotely, using information technology in which we previously invested if needed. We have managed and conducted both field and non-field functions effectively thus far, including our day-to-day operations, our accounting and financial reporting systems and our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to focus on the health and safety of our employees in conformity with the applicable jurisdictional mitigation guidelines. We will continue to monitor CDC guidelines and respond appropriately.
Operational/Financial Challenges
It is difficult to model and predict how our operations and financial status may change as a result of COVID-19. In our industry, any forecast, plans and changes to operations and financial status are a function of commodity prices. If oil prices decline due to a resurgence of COVID-19, we believe we can continue to operate and produce our properties at a minimum in a cash flow neutral position for the next 12 months. A significant driver in the future may be the financial institutions’ view on commodity prices with respect to borrowing base redeterminations. If a resurgence of COVID-19 triggers additional volatility in our business or global economies, our borrowing base could be reduced. Significant reductions in the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement could create a borrowing base deficiency depending on our loans then outstanding which may lead to a default. We believe global as well as national mitigation efforts currently being implemented to fight COVID-19 have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on commodity prices and may continue to present significant challenges to our industry.
The effects of COVID-19, including a substantial decrease in economic activity, have contributed to significant credit, debt and equity market volatility. Similar to other producers in our business, we experienced volatility in the price of our Class A Common Stock.
Organizational Structure
Earthstone is the sole managing member of EEH, with a controlling interest in EEH. Earthstone, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lynden Energy Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia (“Lynden Corp”), and Lynden Corp’s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, Lynden USA, Inc. (“Lynden US”) and also a member of EEH, consolidates the financial results of EEH and records a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements representing the economic interests of EEH’s members other than Earthstone and Lynden US.
Operational Risks
Oil and natural gas exploitation, development and production involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will acquire, discover or produce additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.
As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. For further discussion of these risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
Marketing and Customers
We market the majority of the production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our production to purchasers at market prices.
We normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the year ended December 31, 2021, two purchasers accounted for 34% and 13%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, three purchasers accounted for 32%, 15% and 12%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, three purchasers accounted for 30%, 14% and 12%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. If a major customer stopped purchasing oil and natural gas from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. However, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products in our area of operations with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.
Transportation
During the planning stage of our prospective and productive units and acreage, we consider required flow-lines, gathering and delivery infrastructure. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries or delivery points through our flow-lines or gathering systems. Purchasers of our oil take delivery (i) at a pipeline delivery point or (ii) at our tank batteries for transport by truck. Our natural gas is transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s meter and pipeline interconnection point through our gathering systems. We have implemented a Leak Detection and Repair program, or LDAR, to locate and repair leaking components including valves, pumps and connectors in order to minimize the emission of fugitive volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants. In addition, we install vapor recovery units in our newly installed tank batteries which also reduces emissions. 
Our produced salt water is generally moved by pipeline connected to our operated salt water disposal wells or by pipeline to commercial disposal facilities.
Commodity Hedging
Consistent with our disciplined approach to financial management, we have an active commodity hedging program through which we seek to hedge a meaningful portion of our expected oil and gas production, reducing our exposure to downside commodity prices and enabling us to protect cash flows and maintain liquidity to fund our capital program.
Competition
The domestic oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in the acquisition of acreage, production and oil and gas reserves and in producing, transporting and marketing activities. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, drilling partnership programs, individual producers, natural gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. They may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on prospective oil and natural gas properties and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties, than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties in the future, and our ability to fund the acquisition of such properties, will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate related transactions in a highly competitive environment.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
Segment Information and Geographic Area
Operating segments are defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as components of an enterprise that (i) engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.
Based on our organization and management, we have only one reportable operating segment, which is oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production. All of our operations are currently conducted in Texas and New Mexico.
Seasonality of Business
Weather conditions often affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas drilling, completion and production activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
Markets for Sale of Production
Our ability to market oil and natural gas found and produced, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated. Some of these factors include, without limitation, the availability of other 
domestic and foreign production, the marketing of competitive fuels, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, fluctuations in supply and demand, the availability of a ready market, the effect of United States federal and state regulation of production, refining, transportation and sales and general national and worldwide economic conditions. Additionally, we may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices and we may experience short-term delays in marketing oil due to trucking and refining constraints. There is no assurance that we will be able to market significant amounts of oil or natural gas produced, or, if such oil or natural gas is marketed, that favorable prices can be obtained.
The United States natural gas market has undergone several significant changes over the past few decades. The majority of federal price ceilings were removed in 1985 and the remainder were lifted by the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989. Thus, currently, the United States natural gas market is operating in a free market environment in which the price of gas is determined by market forces rather than by regulations. At the same time, the domestic natural gas industry has also seen a dramatic change in the manner in which gas is bought, sold and transported. In most cases, natural gas is no longer sold to a pipeline company. Instead, the pipeline company now primarily serves the role of transporter and gas producers are free to sell their product to marketers, local distribution companies, end users or a combination thereof.
In view of the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, we are unable to accurately predict future oil, natural gas and NGLs prices or the overall effect, if any, that the decline in demand for and the oversupply of such products will have on our financial condition or results of operations.
Title to Properties
We believe that the title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:
•royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and natural gas leases;
•overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;
•a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, participation agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;
•back-ins and reversionary interests existing under various agreements and leasehold assignments;
•liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements;
•pooling, unitization and other agreements, declarations and orders; and
•easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.
To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the quantity and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our oil and natural gas properties are common in our industry with respect to the types of properties we own.

All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory and regulatory provisions affecting drilling, completion, and production activities, including, but not limited to, provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Moreover, the current administration has indicated that it expects to impose additional federal regulations limiting access to and production from federal lands. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, while some states, including New Mexico, allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate development, other states including Texas, where we operate, rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if we own or control less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or 
other restrictions on exploration, development and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration, development and production to proceed.
The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and negatively affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas
The transportation and sale, or resale, of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Regulation of Sales of Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs
The prices at which we sell oil, natural gas and NGLs are not currently subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. FERC, however, regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of transportation service, which affects the marketing of the natural gas we produce, as well as the prices we receive for sales of our natural gas. Similarly, the price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. FERC regulates the transportation of oil and liquids on interstate pipelines under the provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and regulations issued under those statutes. Intrastate transportation of oil, NGLs, and other products, is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. In addition, while sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate, and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 
Changes in FERC or state policies and regulations or laws may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action that FERC or state regulatory bodies will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a well or production related facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs, may affect our business including oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business 
operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain categories of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially responsible persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, but we are not presently aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and solid (non-hazardous) wastes. With the approval of the EPA, the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s solid (non-hazardous) waste provisions. However, legislation has been proposed from time to time and various environmental groups have filed lawsuits that, if successful, could result in the reclassification of certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make such wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on our business.
From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes.
Water Discharges
The federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over Waters of the United States (the “WOTUS rule”) became effective. Following the change in U.S. Presidential Administrations, there have been several attempts to modify or eliminate this rule. For example, on January 23, 2020, the EPA and the Corps finalized the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which narrows the definition of “waters of the United States” relative to the prior 2015 rulemaking. In November 2021, the EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rule to broaden the applicability of the definition of WOTUS. The agencies did not announce a date for official publication in the Federal Register of the new rule. However, future rulemakings regarding the definition of WOTUS will likely be subject to litigation. As a result of these developments, the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act is uncertain at this time.
The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay our operations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.
Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of saltwater disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. In New Mexico, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (“NMOCD”) administers the UIC program for all injection wells that are related to oil and natural gas production. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) regulates the disposal of produced water by injection well. Permits must be obtained before drilling saltwater disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and natural gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or placed volumetric injection limits on existing wells or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. In response to concerns related to induced seismicity, regulators in some states have already adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the RRC has adopted rules for injection wells to address these seismic activity concerns in Texas. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. In 2021, the NMOCD announced a new plan for responding to increased seismic activity in the Permian Basin. Under the new plan, pending permits for wastewater injection in certain areas will be subject to additional reporting and monitoring requirements. More stringent regulation of injection wells could lead to reduced construction or the capacity of such wells, which could in turn impact the availability of injection wells for disposal of wastewater from our operations. Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. The costs associated with the disposal of proposed water are commonly incurred by all oil and natural gas producers, however, and we do not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, third-party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing which is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations in order to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator.
The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process.
Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the fracturing process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program, specifically as “Class II” UIC wells.
In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment (“CWT”) facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.
Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability 
Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
Several states, including Texas, have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. For example, Texas law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) for disclosure on a website and also file the list of chemicals with the RRC with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the RRC. Additionally, New Mexico has adopted regulations that require the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process. If new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. Several lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.
From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in the U.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. On January 28, 2020, Senate Bill 3247 was introduced and if enacted as proposed, would ban hydraulic fracturing nationwide by 2025.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards to regulate emissions of sources of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), sulfur dioxide, air toxics and methane from various oil and natural gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. On May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, the Trump Administration directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rule making to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. In September 2020, the EPA finalized amendments to the 2016 standards that removed the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. However, President Biden signed an executive order on his first day in office calling for the suspension, revision, or rescission of the September 2020 rule and the reinstatement or issuance of methane emission standards for new, modified, and existing oil and gas facilities. Given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas production activities. In November 2021, the EPA proposed new source performance standards and emissions guidelines to reduce methane and other pollution from new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. The proposed rule would include, among other things, a comprehensive monitoring program for new and existing well sites, zero-emissions standards for new and 
existing pneumatic controls, and standards to eliminate venting of associated gas and requirements for the capture and sale of natural gas where a sales line is available. If adopted, these requirements could increase our costs to operate and control pollution. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Until these rules are formally adopted, we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty.
In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone. In December 2020, the EPA announced its intention to leave the ozone NAAQS unchanged at 70 parts per billion rather than lower them further. However, as discussed above, that action could be subject to reversal following the Biden Administration’s January 2021 executive order. In 2022, the New Mexico Environment Department is expected to issue final rules imposing more stringent limits on ozone pollution from the oil and gas industry operating in the state. Reclassification of areas of state implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay, or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Moreover, the NMOCD recently adopted new rules, which require oil and gas operators to capture 98 percent of their natural gas waste by the end of 2026. The new rules went into effect on May 25, 2021. While the State of Texas has not formally conducted a recent rulemaking related to air emissions, scrutiny of oil and natural gas operations and the rules affecting them have increased in recent years. For example, the EPA and environmental non-governmental organizations have conducted flyovers with optical gas imaging cameras to survey emissions from oil and natural gas production facilities and transmission infrastructure. In addition, the RRC has increased oversight related to flaring, with reporting reviews and site inspections. While none of these activities increases our compliance obligations, they signal the potential for increased enforcement and possible rulemaking in the future.
Climate Change
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs endanger public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” for nations to limit their GHG emissions through non-binding, individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden pledged the renewed participation of the United States on his first day in office. In November 2021, the United States participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom (“COP26”). COP26 resulted in a pact among approximately 200 countries, including the United States, called the Glasgow Climate Pact. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of the “Global Methane Pledge,” which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. In conjunction with COP26, the United States committed to an economy-wide target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Also in November 2021, President Biden signed a $1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill into law. The new infrastructure law includes several climate-focused investments, including upgrades to power grids to accommodate increased use of renewable energy and expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure. Although it is not possible at this time to predict what additional domestic legislation may be adopted in light of the Paris Agreement or the Glasgow Climate Pact, or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted based on the Paris Agreement or the Glasgow Climate Pact to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations and could decrease demand for oil and natural gas. 
Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. For example, the New Mexico Environment Department has adopted regulations to restrict the venting or flaring of methane from both upstream and midstream operations.
Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.
There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in us restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or having an impaired ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. We also are aware that the SEC intends to propose new and additional rules regarding company disclosure of climate change risk. We will monitor and comply with any such promulgated rules.
Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and natural resources
Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”) and the Clean Water Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. As a result of a 2011 settlement agreement, the FWS was required to determine whether to identify more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS missed the deadline but reportedly continues to review new species for protected status under the ESA pursuant to the settlement agreement. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the MBTA. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes portions of the Permian Basin, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species or that may attract migratory birds, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA and the MBTA, and we are not aware of any proposed ESA listings that will materially affect our operations. Nevertheless, we are monitoring proposed listings by the FWS, such as the January 2022 proposal to list the Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly in New Mexico, to ensure continued compliance. The federal government in the past has issued indictments under the MBTA to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. In January 2020, a new U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”) rule went into effect clarifying that only the intentional taking of protected migratory birds is subject to prosecution under the MTBA. In December 2021, however, that rule was revoked, and a new rule took effect reinstating the prohibition on incidental takes under the MTBA. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our oil and natural gas reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
Hazard communications and community right to know
We are subject to federal and state hazard communication and community right to know statutes and regulations. These regulations, including, but not limited to, the federal Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act, govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances and may require that information be provided to state and local government authorities, as well as the public.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In 2016, there were substantial revisions to the regulations under OSHA that may have an impact to our operations. These changes include among other items; record keeping and reporting, revised crystalline silica standard (which requires the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 23, 2021), naming oil and gas as a high hazard industry and requirements for a safety and health management system. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
State Regulation
Texas and New Mexico regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas and New Mexico currently impose a severance tax on oil production of 4.6% and 3.75%, respectively, and a severance tax on natural gas and NGL production of 7.5% and 3.75%, respectively. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowable from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure our stockholders that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.
The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
Related Insurance
We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration, development and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site, and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue.
