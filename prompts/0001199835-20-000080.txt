ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
COMPANY HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2001 under the name Altus Explorations Inc. (Altus) as a company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. The company has not been able to secure sufficient financing to act on oil and gas investment opportunities as they were identified. Therefore, we did very little business and showed very limited activity, with no profitability. In September 2010 we chose to enter the expanding field of training of peace and law enforcement officers as well as other professionals involved in the fields of security and safety oriented civilian training at both the individual and corporate levels. and entered into an agreement, in principle, to purchase Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. from UWD Unitas World Development Inc. (UNITAS), a private Canadian company. We refer to this asset purchase transaction as the Acquisition. On October 1, 2010, Altus entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement) with Unitas. Pursuant to the Agreement, Altus issued 80,000,000 shares of common stock for the acquisition of 450 shares of common stock of The Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc., representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which were held by UWD. On November 4, 2010, Altus changed its name to Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. (CTTA) (the Company subsequently changed its name to Earth Life Sciences Inc. on June 2, 2014) and increased the authorized share capital from 40,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and then further from 250,000,000 to 450,000,000. On December 4, 2018 the authorized share capital was increased 500,000,000 common shares.
INVESTMENT IN MARIJUANA AND/OR HEMP PRODUCTS
 
The Company was considering a project in the marijuana market. Several companies have entered this market attracted by the potential for growth. The Company became interested in the marijuana business in 2016. The Company subcontracted the writing of a business plan, the first draft being available on June 1, 2017 and a final draft available on July 23, 2018. The draft business plan had covered the following subject areas:

The Company contemplated the production of cannabis plants in various locations. Meetings were held with knowledgeable practitioners in Denver, CO, the Okanagan and Montreal, PQ on several occasions in 2017 and 2018.
 
There are numerous business issues in the contemplation of an entry into the marijuana marketplace:
 

Recreational marijuana legalization 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal recreational use 
Medical marijuana uses and legalization 
Marijuana decriminalization 
Marijuana businesses may not be able to secure bank accounts or transfer funds 
Cultivation licenses 
Federal vs. State laws and or Provincial 
State marijuana laws and rules are not uniform from state to state and they can and do change constantly 

 As well there are severe legal and disclosure issues:
 

Marijuana is federally illegal 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investors risk criminal liability and the cannabis businesss assets are subject to forfeiture 
IRC 280E – cannabis companies are unable to deduct expenses 

Hemp Business
 
The following is a discussion of status hemp plants in the United States and Canada. (Any discussion on hemp plants has to include the comparison to marijuana.)
 
Difference between marijuana and hemp plants:
 
Hemp vary from marijuana in its appearance, function, cultivation and applications. Marijuana leaves are either broad leafed, a tight bud, or look like a nugget with hairs, and it resembles a short fat bush. Hemp has skinny leaves concentrated at the top with a few branches below and the plant tends to be skinny and tall. Hemp plants originally were grown to make rope. In the 1800s it was customary and sometimes mandatory to grow hemp pertaining to its use in the military. More recently marijuana plants have been crossed with hemp plants and now contain cannabidiols (CBD) oils
 
Marijuana plants contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is considered a drug and is responsible for the high (psychological) effects, with marijuana plants containing from 5-30%. Hemp (to be legal) has a THC level of less than 0.3%, essentially eliminating any effect to get a high.
 
Marijuana plants can also have a high cannabidiol (CBD) content. Hemp plants do not normally have a high CBD content if any at all. Both marijuana and hemp plants containing any amount of CBD are treated as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States. About 30 states have various regulations for the distribution of marijuana and hemp products exceeding allowed limits. On October 17, 2018, CBD became legal for recreational and medical use in Canada.
 
Conclusion
 
The Company considered the various aspects of the marijuana business and has decided to not enter this space. Satisfactory answers were not found. Although there appears to be several companies entering the marijuana space, and investors seem to have an appetite, the Company became disinterested. The Company has not entered into any agreements or contracts in growing, preparing, inspecting, advising, shipping, purchasing, sampling or selling any marijuana preparations.
INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SOFTWARE
 
In June of 2019, the Company started negotiations with a group of software developers with partners in USA, Canada, Asia and Europe (Software Group). The Software Group has developed, sold and is currently providing support services for products they have developed. Over the next six months the parties discussed a software product to provide mileage based loyalty systems for public transportation. On January 6, 2020 the parties signed an agreement.

The public transportation system in the US is a large industry. It is our contention that industry is seeking increased ridership by various means. We intend to offer the industry, a timely and current software, to assist the industry in reaching out to their ridership, and also meet other information demands.
 
The Company built its own database and compiled information on over 600 companies in the US. The purpose was to assess various entities as to their anticipated interest and/or enthusiasm for our transportation software. The Company may also reach out to foreign companies to test its software and potential use.
 
The Software
 
The Software was designed by the Software Group. The purpose of software is to identify what loyalty rewards and incentives should be given to whom and when to entice maximum-efficiency usage of public transportation based on unique rider behavior. The term maximum efficiency is a strategy such as return on investment (ROI); increase of ridership, decongestion analysis, interruption of service compensation, congestion management, and prediction analysis of ridership usage patterns. The delivery of the software can be directed to various rider groups by way of apps (an application, especially as downloaded by a user to a mobile device), via contactless smart cards or multi-tenant platforms. System can be implemented as a multi-tenant SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. Transit companies will be able to integrate platforms into their workflow and systems using APIs (application programming interface). The future is with smart transportation technology.
 
The Software Group own and are willing to lease their proprietary AI (Artificial Intelligence) software to the Company on an as-needed basis. Their AI software has passed rigorous model testing with several patents having been applied for. AI is simply software that can test certain algorithms and large amounts of data to give data patterns some significance, heuristics and/or importance.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will issue 32 million common shares to the Software Group and upon receiving a working version of the software and necessary support documentation, the Company will deliver 125 million shares after testing, acceptance, and license transfer of the software. Further deliveries of 100 million shares will be based on gross sales of $1 million being reached in a consecutive twelve-month period within 3 years a further 100 million shares after gross sales of $5 million being reached in a consecutive twelve-month period within 5 years. All shares being issued are restricted.
