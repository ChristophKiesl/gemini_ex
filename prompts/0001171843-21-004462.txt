Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical innovator that has historically focused on the research, development and commercialization of cardiometabolic prescription drugs using omega-3, or OM3 fatty acids delivered both as free fatty acids and bound-to-phospholipid esters, derived from krill oil. OM3 fatty acids have extensive clinical evidence of safety and efficacy in lowering triglycerides in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, or HTG. Our lead product candidate was CaPre, an OM3 phospholipid therapeutic. As a result of disappointing results from our two TRILOGY phase 3 trials, we publicly disclosed that our board had commenced a formal process to explore and evaluate a range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, and that it had engaged Oppenheimer & Co. as its financial advisor to assist in that process. Since that announcement, we continue to maintain an active pharmaceutical development business, including retaining key research and development, finance and administrative personnel. We have completed a pooled analysis of the TRILOGY data and we have prepared a manuscript for publication, which has been submitted to a major journal. We continue to manage ongoing regulatory filing obligations with the Federal Drug Administration, or the FDA, and, evaluate potential strategic partnerships for the continued clinical development of CaPre. We also continue to maintain and further develop valuable CaPre assets including additional patent filings and ongoing prosecutions, and maintenance of our commercial manufacturing equipment. Since September 2020, we increased our available cash by approximately $54.4 million through financing activities, which has served to strengthen Acasti’s balance sheet while providing additional flexibility and leverage while we worked through our strategic evaluation process and advancement of a potential commercial partnership for CaPre. On May 7, 2021, we announced our intent to acquire Grace through an acquisition. Grace is a New Jersey-based life sciences company focused on novel and innovative drug delivery technologies designed to improve clinical outcomes in rare and orphan disease treatments. Grace’s scientific and product development efforts are focused in cardiovascular, central nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders.
Recent Developments
 
TRILOGY 1 & 2 Topline Results
 
Our two Phase 3 clinical trials, designated as TRILOGY 1 & 2 randomized a total of 242 and 278 patients respectively, and were designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CaPre in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. The top-line results were announced on January 13, 2020, and August 31, 2020 respectively, and neither TRILOGY 1 nor TRILOGY 2 met their primary endpoint for lowering triglycerides at 12 weeks. CaPre was well tolerated in TRILOGY, with a safety profile similar to placebo, and consistent with our previously conducted Phase 2 and 3 studies. Given the outcome of the TRILOGY studies we will not file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, and we do not plan to conduct additional clinical trials for CaPre. Instead, we plan to continue to advance discussions with third parties who are interested in pursuing clinical development and regulatory approval for CaPre.
Engaged Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. to Assist in Strategic Review
 
On September 29, 2020, we announced that we had commenced a formal process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Towards this end, we engaged Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. as our financial advisor to assist in the process. We have devoted significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives, which led to the announced pending transaction with Grace. However, there can be no assurance that our proposed merger with Grace will close, or of the timing of any such outcome. We have also devoted significant time and resources to identify and evaluate potential strategic partnerships for CaPre; however, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in any agreements or transactions that will enhance shareholder value. We do not intend to make any further disclosures regarding the strategic process for CaPre unless and until a specific course of action is approved by our board of directors.

Definitive Agreement to Acquire Grace Therapeutics, Inc.
 
On May 7, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Grace. Subject to the completion of the Proposed Transaction, we will acquire Grace’s pipeline of drug candidates addressing critical unmet medical needs for the treatment of rare and orphan diseases. The Proposed Transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is supported by a majority of Grace stockholders through voting and lock-up agreements with Acasti. The transaction remains subject to approval of our shareholders, as well as applicable stock exchanges.
 
In connection with the Proposed Transaction, we will acquire Grace’s entire therapeutic pipeline consisting of three unique clinical stage and multiple pre-clinical stage assets supported by an intellectual property portfolio consisting of more than 40 granted and pending patents in various jurisdictions worldwide. Grace’s product candidates aim to improve clinical outcomes by applying proprietary formulation and drug delivery technologies to existing pharmaceutical compounds to achieve improvements over the current standard of care, or to provide treatment for diseases with no currently approved therapy. Grace’s three lead programs have all received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, which could provide up to seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States upon the FDA’s approval of the NDA, provided that certain conditions are met.
 
Management and Operations
 
Subject to shareholder approval of the Proposed Transaction, the combined companies will be led by Jan D’Alvise as President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and will continue to maintain our corporate headquarters in Laval, Quebec, Canada. It is expected that all Grace employees will transition to Acasti and they will continue to maintain an R&D laboratory and commercial presence in North Brunswick, New Jersey. The new board of directors of the combined company will be composed of 4 representatives from Acasti and 3 representatives from Grace.
About the Proposed Transaction
 
Pending approval by our shareholders as well as applicable stock exchange approvals, Grace will merge with a new wholly owned subsidiary of Acasti. Grace stockholders will receive newly issued Acasti common shares pursuant to an equity exchange ratio formula set forth in the merger agreement. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, immediately following the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, Acasti’s shareholders on a pro forma basis would own approximately 55% of the combined company’s common shares, and Grace’s stockholders would own approximately 45% of the combined company’s common shares, in each case calculated on a fully-diluted basis, subject to upward adjustments in favor of Acasti shareholders based on each company’s capitalization and net cash balance as set forth in the merger agreement. For illustrative purposes, assuming no adjustments for each company’s capitalization and net cash balance and based on 208,375,549 Acasti common shares currently issued and outstanding, an aggregate of up to 170,489,086 Acasti common would be issued to Grace stockholders as consideration for the Proposed Transaction.
 
In connection with the entering into the merger agreement, all significant stockholders of Grace have entered into voting and lock-up agreements with Acasti pursuant to which they have agreed, amongst other things to (i) vote their shares of Grace in favor of the Proposed Transaction, (ii) be subject to lock-up provisions for a period of 12 months (subject to certain exceptions), and (iii) support the election of board nominees specified in the voting and lock-up agreements through to the 2023 annual general meeting of shareholders.
 
The Proposed Transaction is expected to close in calendar the third quarter of 2021, immediately following approval by the Acasti shareholders, subject to any applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) review and stock exchange approvals, as well as satisfaction of other closing conditions by each company specified in the definitive agreement.
 
Oppenheimer & Co. is acting as the Acasti’s financial advisor for the Proposed Transaction and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, LLP is serving as its legal counsel. William Blair & Company, LLC is serving as financial advisor to Grace, with Reed Smith, LLP serving as its legal counsel.

Nasdaq Update
 
On May 11, 2021, Acasti received written notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notifying Acasti that based upon Acasti’s non-compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a) as of May 10, 2021, Acasti common shares were subject to delisting unless Acasti timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. Acasti requested a hearing, which stayed any further action by Nasdaq pending the conclusion of the hearing process.
 
At the hearing on June 17, 2021, Acasti presented a detailed plan of compliance for the Nasdaq Listing Panel’s consideration, which included Acasti’s commitment to implement a share consolidation in connection with the Proposed Transaction. Acasti expects to receive the Nasdaq Listing Panel’s decision within 30 days after the hearing date. There can be no assurance that Nasdaq will accept Acasti’s plan or that Acasti will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules or maintain compliance with any other Nasdaq requirement in the future. The approval by Nasdaq of (i) the continued listing of Acasti’s common shares on Nasdaq following the effective time and (ii) the listing of the Acasti common shares being issued in connection with the merger on Nasdaq at or prior to the effective time are conditions to the closing of the merger.
 
COVID-19 Update
 
To date, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has not caused significant disruptions to our business operations and research and development activities.
 
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business and prospects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or treat its impact, among others.
