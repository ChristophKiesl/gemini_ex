Business Overview 
 
With respect to this discussion, the terms, the “Company” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Nocera, Inc. (“Nocera”), and its 100%-owned subsidiary Grand Smooth Inc Limited. (“GSI”), GSI’s wholly-owned subsidiary Guizhou Grand Smooth Technology Ltd. (“GZ GST”), the Company’s Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”), Guizhou Wan Feng Hu Intelligent Aquatic Technology Co. Limited. (“GZ WFH”) and Xin Feng Construction Co., Ltd. (“XFC”).
 
Our History
 
Nocera, Inc. was organized on February 1, 2002 under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
On February 12, 2002, we acquired Felice Conserve, an Italian corporation, as a wholly- owned subsidiary in exchange for 20 million shares of our common stock. The principal business of Felice Conserve was the production and processing of agricultural products in Italy. The principal product was canned tomatoes. 
 
In 2003, we established two subsidiaries in Uruguay; Sontemar, SA (“Sontemar”), and Noldicor, SA (“Noldicor”). The principal business of Noldicor was the production of tomatoes. The principal business of Sontemar was the processing and sale of packaged tomatoes. On April 23, 2004, we paid a 4 for 1 stock dividend to our stockholders.
 
The Company abandoned operations in 2005. In 2006, due to financial difficulties, Noldicor and Sontemar ceased operations. As a result of this, our operations in Uruguay ceased. Additionally, during 2006, Felice Conserve was divested back to its original stockholders. This resulted in our returning to development stage status.
 
On approximately November 3, 2017, we effected a reverse-split of our common stock as follows:
 

· | A 1 for 40,000 reverse-split of the Company’s common stock, followed immediately by;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All fractional shares shall be rounded upwards to the nearest whole share, followed immediately by;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A 200 for 1 forward stock split.
--+---------------------------------

 
The net effect of these actions was a 1 for 200 reverse-split of the Company’s common stock, with no stockholder being reduced below 200 shares. All stockholders who prior to the reverse-split had 40,000 or less of the pre-split shares received 200 of the new, post-split shares. 
 
Effective December 31, 2018, we completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), with (i) Grand Smooth Inc Limited, a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong, China (“GSI”), (ii) GSI’s stockholders, Yin-Chieh Cheng and Bi Zhang, who together owned shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of GSI (the “GSI Shares”) and (iii) GSI Acquisition Corp. Under the terms of the Agreement, the GSI Stockholders transferred to us all of the GSI Shares in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, we are a public company holding a subsidiary in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) engaged in aquaculture consulting and management business. We did not cancel or retire any shares of our issued and outstanding common stock and as a result, we have 12,349,200 shares of common stock issued and outstanding following the Share Exchange.
 
As of the Effective Date of December 31, 2018 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we are deemed to have consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired all of the GSI Shares in exchange for the issuance of the shares to the GSI Stockholders. As a result of the Share Exchange, we emerged from shell status with our subsidiary, GSI, in Hong Kong engaged in the aquaculture consulting and management business through VIE in PRC under legal and accounting principles.

On September 21, 2020, the Company filed a current report on Form 8-K outlining the lack of communication that leads to the termination by Nocera, Inc. of its relationship with GZ WFH and its management, and termination of the Variable Interest Entity agreements between the parties.
 
Subsequently on October 8, 2020, Zhang Bi and GZ WFH entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release with Nocera, Inc. wherein all claims as to GZ WFH’s debt (claim to shares in Nocera, Inc. or GZ GST) were compromised, settled, and otherwise resolved as to any and all claims or causes of action whatsoever against Nocera for any matter, action, or representation as to Nocera, and any debt to ownership of Nocera or GZ GST up to the date of the agreement. The consideration for the agreement was mutual waiver of any and all claims against each other and GZ GST, and GZ WFH (including Zhang Bi) waives any claims to Nocera stock, meaning the 4,750,000 shares of common stock of Nocera owned by Zhang Bi were cancelled as part of the agreement. The Settlement Agreement and Release is attached hereto as Exhibit.
 
On December 31, 2020, Nocera, Inc. (“Nocera”) and Xin Feng Construction Co., Ltd. (“XFC”), a domestic funded limited liability company registered in Taiwan (R.O.C.), (collectively “the Parties”) entered into a series of contractual agreements (“VIE Agreements”) whereby Nocera, Inc. agreed to provide technical consulting and related services to Xin Feng Construction Co., Ltd. As a result, Nocera has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of XFC and XFC became VIE (Variable Interest Entity) of Nocera.
 
On December 31, 2020, Nocera, Inc. (“Nocera”) and Shunda Feed Co., Ltd. (“SFC”), a domestic funded limited liability company registered in Taiwan (R.O.C), entered into a series of contractual agreements (“VIE Agreements”) whereby Nocera, Inc. agreed to provide technical consulting and related services to Shunda Feed Co., Ltd. However, The Company has received no communications or information from SFC regarding its financial conditions or operations for the purpose of the annual audit and the close of the VIE acquisition. Therefore, on March 18, 2021, the Company rescinded the acquisition of SFC and as a result of the rescission, the 300,000 common shares previously issued to the shareholders of SFC per the VIE Agreements have been cancelled by action of the Board of Directors.
 
Corporate Structure
 
Our current corporate structure is set forth below:
 


Until we consummated on the Agreement and Plan of Merger effective December 31, 2018, we were a shell company that had no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets. Our wholly owned subsidiary, GSI, was incorporated in Hong Kong, China on August 1, 2014. GSI is the parent holding company of GZ GST, which was established on November 13, 2018 as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (“WFOE”) established in the People’s Republic of China.

On December 31, 2020, the Company and XFC entered into VIE contracts whereby the Company agreed to provide technical consulting and related services to Xin Feng Construction Co., Ltd. As a result, Nocera has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of XFC and XFC became VIE (Variable Interest Entity) of Nocera – namely the Company has the majority interest in the VIE and through execution of VIE contracts, Nocera has contract commitments that the financial information of the VIE should be consolidated based on the Variable Interest Ownership percentage owned by the Company.
 
The VIE structure was adopted mainly because the Taiwan operating company may in the future engage in business that may require special licenses in Taiwan and which can be an industry that prohibits foreign investment. Nocera has entered into the following contractual arrangements with shareholders of XFC, that enable the Company to (1) have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affects the economic performance of XFC, and (2) receive the economic benefits of XFC that could be significant to XFC. The Company is fully and exclusively responsible for the management of XFC, assumes all of the risk of losses of XFC and has the exclusive right to exercise all voting rights of XFC shareholders.
 
VIE contracts are as follows:
 

1. | Voting Rights Proxy Agreement
---+------------------------------


2. | Equity Pledge Agreement

3. | Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement

4. | Exclusive Call Option Agreement

We believe our experience and innovation from working closely with our clients in the aquaculture industry in China and Taiwan (R.O.C.) gives us the competitive advantages to provide innovative aquaculture management solutions that will generate positive results for our future client companies, however, there can be no assurances we will be successful.
 
Market Overview
 
The fish farming industry in China was predominately regulated by state and local government allowing local fish farmers to set up fish nests in public water including water dams, rivers, lakes and etc. It is the dominant source of freshwater fish for both domestic demands and exports. Since the clean water policy was implemented in China in 2017 by the central government, the state and local governments are tasked with cleaning up local water sources and banning all fish nets and fish nests in public waters. The City of Xing Yi, for example, used to produce 15,000 tons of freshwater fish a year, however, that has been all banned and the government subsidy terminated so that now the 300 million pounds of freshwater fish are no longer produced.

This is a countrywide effort where some ponds or lakes are removed immediately and some will phase out gradually in 2 to 3 years. Nevertheless, under China’s government clean water policy of “retreating from lakes to lands” for fish farming, we believe that this presents to us a great opportunity for introducing our land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (“RAS”). It was introduced in 2015 as a new and extremely simple way for local farmers to breed fish in China. It is also known as “container fish-farming for dummies”. Generating up to 35 times of fish harvest per square meter compared to traditional fish farms in the pond, it also conserves the ecosystem of lakes, reduces local poverty, and protects the species from natural disasters.
 
Domestic demand in China and Taiwan (R.O.C.) is increasing the number of aquaculture projects and investment, therein. Our Aquaculture solution is innovative and environmentally friendly using a state-of-the-art water recycling and filtration system. We estimate the demand in China and in Taiwan (R.O.C.) could be over 5,000 RAS in the next 5 years. And globally, we believe that there could be a demand for 10,000 RAS.
 
Today, the world is faced with the growing challenge of reducing and controlling water pollution that presents serious health risks to its population and damages the environment. We believe that our Aquaculture container fish farm represents a large-scale, environmentally friendly and economically feasible form for bringing clean fish to the table and bringing clean water back to the people. In our opinion, our service is cost competitive, reduces water pollution and recycles fish waste and will help make for a greener and better world in the years to come.
 
Strategy
 
We aim to become a global leader, starting from China and Taiwan (R.O.C.), in the field of land-based aquaculture business. We believe following strategies are the critical to achieve this goal:
 
Focus on the countries with growing population and growing demand for food
 By 2050 we’ll need to double the global food supply to feed the world’s growing population. There is a growing need for new ways to produce high-quality local fish without putting more pressure on our natural ecosystems. Like China, there are also many countries with growing population and growing demand for high-protein food. We plan to go global through building demo sites promoting our RAS and selling our price-competitive systems in these countries for their demand for food and greener environment.
 
Customers
 
Currently we have a firm order to build 800 sets of 2 meters high by 8 meters wide cylindrical fish farming containers that we received from Dong Guan CIMC Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd (“DG CIMC”), which holds 5% non-controlling interest of GZ WFH, and Shen Zhen CIMC Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd (“SZ CIMC”) in 2018. Both DG CIMC and SZ CIMC are subsidiaries of China International Marine Container Corporation (“CIMC”). We estimate this order to be valued at approximately $8.2 million and we have already delivered 473 sets during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to deliver these sets throughout 2020.
 
In July 2019, we entered into a sales agreement of 400 sets RAS tanks with Dongguan CIMC, amounting to approximately $5.7 million (RMB 40 million). According to the agreement, the customer shall make 40% of the consideration as down payment before we start the manufacturing. We expect to receive the down payment in the third quarter of 2020, and target to complete the manufacturing of the 400 sets in the fourth quarter of 2020.
 
In September 2019, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement (“distribution agreement”) with JC Development, Co. Ltd. in Taiwan, which is an independent third-party company. JC Development Co, Ltd. agrees to pay Nocera a total amount of $5 million over 5 years starting September 2019 to be our perpetual exclusive sales agent in Asia Pacific. We agreed to pay 8% commission of total sales excluding sales made by CIMC Smart Science & Technology CO., Ltd. (“CIMC SSC”) in China.
 
In March 2020 we entered into an agreement with the People’s Government of Wujiang Town, Bozhou District, Zunyi City to supply 58 tank systems. This contract is for $573,029 (RMB 3.99 million 1). 
 
In 2021, we intend to target customers in a variety of markets, such as individual investors, government supported or funded companies and international customers. We have received interest from areas like Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Jordan, South Africa and the United States. In addition, an increasing amount of Chinese state and local offices are faced with environmental challenges in public waters and are under regulatory directives and political pressure to reduce water pollution, so our potential target customers are significant. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the net sales were approximately $1.2 million and approximately $0.5 million, respectively.

Suppliers
 
We intend to purchase raw materials and electrical parts and equipment from third parties in the PRC and Taiwan (R.O.C.) and resell and install to customers. We are not directly involved in the production or manufacturing of this equipment and we do not take a risk in the repair and maintenance of this equipment because of the manufacturer’s maintenance policy but may provide maintenance personnel. Our suppliers are concentrated with one supplier which accounted for 100% in total purchase during the year ended December 31, 2020; and concentrated with two suppliers which accounted for 92.08% in total purchase during the year ended December 31, 2019; presently, our relationships with suppliers are generally good and we expect that our suppliers will be able to meet the anticipated demand for our products in the future.
Competition
 
The market for aquaculture projects and services is highly competitive. Many of the producers and sellers are large entities that have significantly greater resources than we have. Therefore, we signed VIE contracts to partner with XFC to use their local resources in Taixi township, Taiwan (R.O.C.) to develop land-based RAS fish farms in Taiwan and hopefully gain a more competitive advantage. We also compete with small suppliers which provide smaller alternative aquaculture solutions regionally but due to the size of our projects, we believe that we should have a better price point.
Trademarks and Patents
 
None
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business depends in part on environmental regulations and programs in China and Taiwan (R.O.C.) that promote cleaner water sources to restore clean water back to people. Our customers may be encouraged with incentives by the local governments relating to aquaculture investment. The approvals of land, licenses or permits, are required from relevant central and local government authorities. In addition, from time to time, relevant government authorities may impose new regulations at a local level regulating fish farming. We believe that we have skills to help our customers obtain all necessary licenses, registrations, and permits to comply with all requirements necessary to allow our customers and investors to conduct aquaculture business in the PRC and Taiwan (R.O.C.).
Legal Proceedings
 
We are currently not a party to any legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened legal or administrative proceedings against us in all material aspects. We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.
Property
 
We do not own any real property.
 
Seasonality
 
Since the global growing demand from aquaculture production along with the decreasing production from wild fisheries and our fish farming systems provide a controlled and traceable environment for species, our business rarely suffers a seasonal impact.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we have 18 full-time employees. We are compliant with local prevailing wage, contractor licensing, and have good relations with our employees.
