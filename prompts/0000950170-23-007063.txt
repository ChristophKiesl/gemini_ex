 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is entitled to receive up to $450.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to our sale of ONIVYDE® to Ipsen S.A., or Ipsen, in April 2017 and up to $54.5 million in contingent milestone payments related to our sale of MM-121 and MM-111 to Elevation Oncology, Inc. (formerly known as 14ner Oncology, Inc.), or Elevation, in July 2019. We do not have any ongoing research or development activities and are seeking potential acquirers for our remaining preclinical and clinical assets. We do not have any employees and instead use external consultants for the operation of our company.
 On April 3, 2017, we completed the sale of ONIVYDE and MM-436 (the “commercial business”) to Ipsen (the “Ipsen sale”). At the time of the sale ONIVYDE was approved in the United States for the second line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. In connection with the Ipsen sale, we are eligible to receive up to $450.0 million in additional regulatory approval-based milestone payments.
 The remaining up to $450.0 million in potential milestone payments resulting from the Ipsen sale consist of:
 •$225.0 million upon approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of ONIVYDE for the first-line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (“mPDAC”), subject to certain conditions;
 •$150.0 million upon approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer after failure of first-line chemotherapy; and
 •$75.0 million upon approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for an additional indication unrelated to those described above.
 Ipsen has recently stated that it intends to file a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Onivyde in combination with oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mPDAC following the Fast Track Designation granted in 2020.
 Our remaining non-commercial assets, including our clinical and preclinical development programs, were not included in the Ipsen sale and all material other clinical and pre-clinical development programs have been sold, as described below.
 On May 30, 2019, we announced the completion of our review of strategic alternatives, following which our board of directors implemented a series of measures designed to extend our cash runway into 2027 and preserve our ability to capture the potential milestone payments resulting from the Ipsen sale. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In connection with that announcement, we discontinued the discovery efforts on our remaining preclinical programs: MM-401, an agonistic antibody targeting a novel immuno-oncology target, TNFR2; and MM-201, a highly stabilized agonist-Fc fusion protein targeting death receptors 4 and 5.
The termination of our executive management team and all other employees was substantially completed by June 28, 2019 and fully completed by July 12, 2019. As of July 12, 2019, we no longer had any employees. We have engaged external consultants to run our day-to-day operations.
On July 12, 2019, we completed the sale to Elevation, or the Elevation sale, of our anti-HER3 antibody programs, MM-121 (seribantumab) and MM-111 for potential use for patients with solid tumors of any origin that have an NRG1 fusion. In connection with the Elevation sale, we are eligible to receive up to $54.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory approval and commercial-based milestone payments, consisting of:
 
•$3.0 million for achievement of the primary endpoint in the first registrational clinical study of either MM-121 or MM-111;
 •up to $16.5 million in total payments for the achievement of various regulatory approval and reimbursement-based milestones in the United States, Europe and Japan; and
 •up to $35.0 million in total payments for achieving various cumulative worldwide net sales targets between $100.0 million and $300.0 million for MM-121 and MM-111.



In January 2023, Elevation announced it is pausing further investment in the clinical development of seribantumab and intends to pursue further development only in collaboration with a partner. Elevation also announced that it intends to present additional interim data from its study of seribantumab in the first half of 2023.
On March 27, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Celator Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Celator Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to purchase certain assets (the “Transferred Assets”) relating to certain of our preclinical nanoliposome programs (the “Transaction”). We completed the Transaction simultaneously with the execution of the Celator Asset Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of $2.1 million, which was recognized in fiscal 2020.
 On September 15, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Option Agreement (the “Assets Purchase Option Agreement”) with a third party, pursuant to which the third party agreed to obtain an exclusive option, to purchase one of our preclinical programs with a consideration of $0.5 million. Under the terms of the Assets Purchase Option Agreement, the third party paid to us the option fee of $0.1 million. The third party had the right to exercise the option within 24 months from September 15, 2021. We recognized a gain of $0.1 million related to the option fee payment for the year ended December 31, 2021. On January 18, 2022, the third party provided written notice to us of its intent to exercise such option and on March 1, 2022, we entered the Asset Purchase Option Agreement with the third party. The consideration of $0.5 million was paid to us and a gain of $0.5 million was recognized in March 2022.
 On January 23, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with a third party (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to obtain an exclusive option (the “Option”) to purchase one of the Company’s preclinical programs for total potential consideration of $0.7 million. Under the terms of the Option Agreement, the Purchaser paid to us the Option fee of $0.2 million in January 2023. The Purchaser may exercise the Option by July 23, 2023.
 We previously devoted substantially all of our resources to our drug discovery and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock, collaborations, public offerings of our securities, secured debt financings, sales of ONIVYDE® and the Ipsen sale.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $19.4 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to continue our operations beyond 2027, which we estimate is beyond the latest date when the longest term potential milestones might be achieved.
We have a history of losses from our operations. We do not expect to be profitable from our operations in the future unless we receive potential future milestone payments, if any. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $547.6 million. Our net loss was $1.5 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not expect to incur any research and development expenses going forward.
 Asset Purchase Agreements
 We are party to certain asset purchase agreements which provide for potentially significant milestone payments. We consider the following agreements to be material to our business.
Ipsen
 On April 3, 2017, we completed the Ipsen sale. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2017, (the "Ipsen Sale Agreement"), between us and Ipsen, Ipsen acquired our right, title and interest in the commercial business. Pursuant to the Ipsen Sale Agreement, we received $575.0 million in cash, plus a working capital adjustment of $5.7 million, and are eligible to receive up to $450.0 million in additional regulatory approval-based milestone payments. Ipsen has agreed pursuant to the Ipsen Sale Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ONIVYDE in connection with obtaining the regulatory approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for certain indications.
•In November 2022, Ipsen announced the Phase III NAPOLI 3 trial of Onivyde® (irinotecan liposome injection) plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (the “NALIRIFOX regimen”) met its primary endpoint demonstrating clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in 770 previously untreated patients with mPDAC and key secondary efficacy outcome of progression-free survival (PFS) also showed significant improvement over the comparator arm. Ipsen also announced that the safety profile of Onivyde in the NAPOLI 3 trial was consistent with those observed in the previous phase I/II mPDAC study. Ipsen also stated that it intends to file a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Onivyde in combination with oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mPDAC following the Fast Track Designation granted in 2020. In January 2023, Ipsen presented clinical trial results at 



the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. In February 2023 Ipsen provided guidance to investors that it intends to file a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration during the first half of 2023 following the Fast Track Designation granted in 2020 for the use of Onivyde in combination with oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mPDAC.
 •In August 2022, Ipsen announced that the Phase III RESILIENT trial did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival compared to topotecan. The trial is evaluating Onivyde® (irinotecan liposomal injection) versus topotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer, who have progressed on or after platinum-based first-line therapy treatment. RESILIENT is a Phase III trial conducted in two parts; the first part read out in 2020 confirming the safety, dosing and efficacy of Onivyde; part two is evaluating the efficacy of Onivyde versus topotecan. In the announcement, Ipsen indicated that detailed results from the RESILIENT trial will be presented at an upcoming medical conference. The analysis concluded that the primary endpoint overall survival was not met in patients treated with Onivyde versus topotecan. However, a doubling of the secondary endpoint of objective response rate in favor of Onivyde was observed. The safety and tolerability of Onivyde was consistent with its already-known safety profile, and no new safety concerns emerged. In the August 2022 announcement, Ipsen reported that the clinical study results will be communicated with the regulatory agency. Ipsen indicated that while the results from the analysis of the RESILIENT trial have not demonstrated an overall survival benefit with Onivyde in patients in second-line small cell lung cancer, it intends to analyze the data further before decisions regarding next steps are made. To date, there have been no further public announcements by Ipsen regarding these matters and it remains unclear as to whether Ipsen will continue to seek approval for the use of ONIVYDE in the small cell lung cancer application. If Ipsen elects not to proceed with seeking regulatory approval, or if regulatory approval is not obtained, we would not be entitled to the $150 million milestone payment tied to approval of Onivyde for treating small cell lung cancer.
 Elevation
On July 12, 2019, we completed the sale to Elevation, or the Elevation sale, of our anti-HER3 antibody programs, MM-121 (seribantumab) and MM-111. In connection with the Elevation sale, we received an upfront cash payment of $3.5 million and are eligible to receive up to $54.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory approval and commercial-based milestone payments, consisting of:
 
•$3.0 million for achievement of the primary endpoint in the first registrational clinical study of either MM-121 or MM-111;
 •up to $16.5 million in total payments for the achievement of various regulatory approval and reimbursement-based milestones in the United States, Europe and Japan; and
 •up to $35.0 million in total payments for achieving various cumulative worldwide net sales targets between $100.0 million and $300.0 million for MM-121 and MM-111.
 
In January 2023, Elevation announced it is pausing further investment in the clinical development of seribantumab and intends to pursue further development only in collaboration with a partner. Elevation also announced that it intends to present additional interim data from its study of seribantumab in the first half of 2023.
 Intellectual Property
 We own or control a very limited number of U.S. patents and patent applications and several corresponding foreign patents and patent applications. This intellectual property relates to several early stage programs that we are no longer advancing on our own, but that may be of value to one or more potential buyer or licensees. During 2023, we will continue to evaluate the usefulness of maintaining the current patent portfolio to our business.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, record keeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, biological products and medical devices, which does not relate directly to us, however could have an impact on Ipsen and Elevation.
Data Protection
 We are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner that is not authorized or permitted.
Employees
 The termination of our executive management team and all other employees was substantially completed by June 28, 2019 and fully completed by July 12, 2019. Since July 12, 2019, we no longer have any employees. We have engaged external consultants to run our day-to-day operations.
