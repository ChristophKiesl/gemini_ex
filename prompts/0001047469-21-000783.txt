     Item 1.    Business 
  ORGANIZATION 
        MSC Income Fund, Inc. ("MSC Income Fund") (formerly known as HMS Income Fund, Inc. through October 30, 2020) was formed as a Maryland corporation on November 28, 2011 under the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland. 
        MSC Income Fund is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). MSC Income Fund has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 
        We refer to MSC Income Fund, collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, as the "Company," and the use of "we," "our," "us" or similar pronouns in this Form 10-K refers to MSC Income Fund or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. On October 28, 2020, our stockholders approved the appointment of MSC Adviser I, LLC ("MSC Adviser" or our "Adviser"), which is wholly owned by Main Street Capital Corporation ("Main Street"), a New York Stock Exchange listed BDC and the previous sub-adviser to the Company, as the Company's new investment adviser, replacing HMS Adviser LP ("HMS Adviser"), which was the Company's investment adviser from inception through October 29, 2020. Following the approval of our stockholders, the Company engaged MSC Adviser as our investment adviser, under an Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement dated October 30, 2020 (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"). Our Adviser has the responsibility to manage the business of the Company, including the responsibility to identify, evaluate, negotiate and structure prospective investments, make investment and portfolio management decisions, monitor the Company's investment portfolio and provide ongoing administrative services. In connection with this change in the investment adviser, we changed our name from HMS Income Fund, Inc. to MSC Income Fund, Inc. 
        We previously offered and sold shares of our common stock on a continuous basis (the "Offering") pursuant to registration statements on Form N-2 that were filed with and declared effective by the SEC. Hines Securities, Inc., an affiliate of HMS Adviser, served as the Dealer Manager for the Offering and continues to provide certain shareholder support services pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement between us, MSC Adviser and Hines Securities, Inc. With the approval of our Board of Directors, we closed the Offering to new investors effective September 30, 2017. We continue to operate the dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which stockholders may elect to have their cash distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2020, we have raised approximately $851.2 million in the Offering including proceeds from the dividend reinvestment plan of approximately $118.3 million. 
        We have six wholly owned subsidiaries. HMS Funding I LLC ("HMS Funding"), MSIF Funding LLC ("MSIF Funding"), MSC Equity Holding, LLC ("MSC Equity Holding") (formerly known as HMS Equity Holding, LLC) and MSC California Holdings GP LLC ("MSC California Holdings GP") (formerly known as HMS California Holdings, GP LLC) are each organized as Delaware limited liability companies, MSC Equity Holding II, Inc. ("MSC Equity Holding II") (formerly known as HMS Equity Holding II, Inc.) is organized as a Delaware corporation and MSC California Holdings LP ("MSC California Holdings") (formerly known as HMS California Holdings LP) is organized as a Delaware limited partnership. HMS Funding was created pursuant to the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility (as defined below) to function as a "Structured Subsidiary," which is permitted to incur debt outside of the TIAA Credit Facility (as defined below) since it is not a guarantor under the TIAA Credit Facility. MSC Equity Holding and MSC Equity Holding II, (the "Taxable Subsidiaries"), which have elected to be taxable entities, primarily hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are "pass through" entities for tax purposes. MSIF Funding was created on December 1, 2020 pursuant to the JPM SPV Facility (defined below) to function as a "Structured Subsidiary," which is permitted to incur debt outside of the TIAA Credit Facility since it is not a guarantor under the TIAA Credit 
 3

   Facility. We refer to the Deutsche Bank Credit Facility, the TIAA Credit Facility and the JPM SPV Facility collectively as our "Credit Facilities." 
        Prior to October 30, 2020, the business of the Company was managed by HMS Adviser, a Texas limited partnership and wholly owned affiliate of Hines Interests Limited Partnership ("Hines"), under an Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement dated May 31, 2012 (as amended, the "Original Investment Advisory Agreement"). Prior to October 30, 2020, we and HMS Adviser retained MSC Adviser as our investment sub-adviser, pursuant to an Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the "Sub-Advisory Agreement"). HMS Adviser and MSC Adviser are each registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"). Upon the execution of the Sub-Advisory Agreement, Main Street became an affiliate of the Company.

 OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS 
        Our primary investment objective is to generate current income through debt and equity investments. A secondary objective is to generate long-term capital appreciation through such equity and equity-related investments, including warrants, convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities. Our portfolio strategy is to invest primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities issued by lower middle market ("LMM") companies, which generally have annual revenues between $10 million and $150 million, and middle market ("Middle Market") companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies and have annual revenues typically between $5 million and $1.5 billion. Our LMM and Middle Market portfolio investments generally range in size from $1 million to $15 million. We categorize some of our investments in LMM companies and Middle Market companies as private loan ("Private Loan") portfolio investments. Private Loan investments, often referred to in the debt markets as "club deals," are investments, generally in debt instruments, that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds. Private Loan investments are typically similar in size, structure, terms and conditions to investments we hold in our LMM portfolio and Middle Market portfolio. Our investment portfolio also includes other portfolio ("Other Portfolio") investments primarily consisting of investments managed by third parties, which may differ from the typical profiles for our other types of investments. In our Other Portfolio, we may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by third parties, such as investments in other investment companies or private funds. 
        The level of new portfolio investment activity fluctuates from period to period based upon our view of the current economic fundamentals, our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria, and our ability to consummate the identified opportunities. The level of new investment activity, and associated interest and fee income, will directly impact future investment income. In addition, the level of dividends paid by portfolio companies and the portion of our portfolio debt investments on non-accrual status will directly impact future investment income. While we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long term, our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods. However, we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook. The level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our investments will also fluctuate depending upon 
 4

   portfolio activity, economic conditions and the performance of our individual portfolio companies. The changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results. 
        We invest in customized direct secured and unsecured loans to and equity securities of LMM companies. In most cases, companies that issue customized LMM securities to us will be privately held at the time we invest in them. Typically, our investments in LMM companies are co-investments with Main Street and/or its affiliates and, as a result, we obtained an exemptive order from the SEC, as discussed below, to permit us to do so. While the structure of our investments in customized LMM securities is likely to vary, we may invest in senior secured debt, senior unsecured debt, subordinated secured debt, subordinated unsecured debt, mezzanine debt, convertible debt, convertible preferred equity, preferred equity, common equity, warrants and other instruments, many of which generate current yields. We will make other investments as allowed by the 1940 Act and consistent with our continued qualification as a RIC. For a discussion of the risks inherent in our portfolio investments, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Relating to our Business and Structure." 
        Our investments may include other equity investments, such as warrants, options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company, or contractual payment rights or rights to receive a proportional interest in the operating cash flow or net income of such company. When determined by our Adviser to be in our best interest, we, in conjunction with other investment funds managed by or affiliated with our Adviser, may acquire a controlling interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities may require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We intend to structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest or, if applicable, controlling-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company upon the occurrence of specified events. In addition, we may obtain demand or "piggyback" registration rights in connection with these equity interests. 
        We plan to hold many of our investments to maturity or repayment but may sell our investments earlier if a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale or recapitalization of a portfolio company, or if we determine the sale to be in our best interest. 
        As a BDC, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making our investments, including limitations on our ability to co-invest with certain affiliates. In April 2014, we received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting co-investments by us and Main Street in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. During December 2020, we received an amended exemptive order from the SEC permitting co-investments by us, Main Street and other funds advised by our Adviser in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. We have made coinvestments with Main Street and in the future intend to make co-investments with Main Street and other funds advised by our Adviser, in accordance with the conditions of the order. The order requires, among other things, that we and our Adviser consider whether each such investment opportunity is appropriate for us and Main Street and other funds advised by our Adviser, as applicable, and if it is appropriate, to propose an allocation of the investment opportunity between such parties. Because our Adviser is not managing our investment activities as its sole activity, this may provide the Adviser an incentive to allocate opportunities to other funds instead of us. However, our Adviser has policies and procedures in place to manage this conflict, including oversight by the independent members of our Board of Directors and the independent members of the Board of Directors of Main Street. Additional information regarding the operation of the co-investment program is set forth in the order granting exemptive relief, which may be reviewed on the SEC's Website at www.sec.gov. 
        In addition to the co-investment program described in this Form 10-K and in the exemptive relief, we may continue to co-invest in syndicated deals and secondary loan market transactions where price is the only negotiated point.

     BUSINESS STRATEGIES 
        Our primary investment objective is to generate current income through debt and equity investments. A secondary objective is to generate long-term capital appreciation through equity and equity-related investments including warrants, convertible securities, and other rights to acquire equity securities. We have adopted the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective:



Utilize the experience and expertise of the principals of our Adviser. The investment
professionals employed by our Adviser are also the investment professionals responsible for investing and managing Main Street's investment portfolio. Main Street is a BDC whose shares are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. Main Street's primary investment focus is providing customized debt and equity financing to LMM companies and debt capital to Middle Market companies that operate in
diverse industry sectors. As of December 31, 2020, Main Street maintained an investment portfolio of debt and equity investments with an aggregate fair value of approximately
$2.7 billion in 188 different portfolio companies. 
Focus on Private Loan and LMM companies with stable cash flow. We believe that there are
relatively few finance companies focused on transactions involving Private Loan and LMM companies, in comparison to the number of finance companies focused on transactions involving larger Middle
Market companies, which allows us the opportunity to negotiate favorable investment terms. Such favorable terms may include higher debt yields, lower leverage levels, more significant covenant
protection and greater equity participation than what may be typical of transactions involving larger companies. We generally invest in established companies with established market positions,
experienced management teams and proven revenue streams, which have a history of producing positive cash flows. We believe that those companies generally possess better risk-adjusted return profiles
than newer companies that are building their management teams or are in the early stages of building a revenue base. We also believe that established companies in our targeted size range also
generally provide opportunities for capital appreciation. Lastly, we believe that these companies represent a significant portion of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investment
to provide liquidity for individual shareholder needs and to grow their businesses. 
Capitalize on our Adviser's Strong Transaction Sourcing Network. Our Adviser seeks to leverage
its extensive network of referral sources for portfolio company investments. Our Adviser has developed a reputation in our marketplace as a responsive, efficient and reliable source of financing,
which has created a growing stream of proprietary deal flow for us. 
Emphasize discipline in our underwriting policies and rigor in our portfolio management. Our
Adviser employs an underwriting process that includes a review of the prospects, competitive position, financial performance and industry dynamics of each potential portfolio company. In addition, we
perform due diligence on potential investments and seek to invest with management teams and/or private equity sponsors who have proven capabilities in building value. Through our Adviser, we offer
managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, giving them access to our investment experience, direct industry expertise and contacts and allowing us to continually monitor their progress. As part
of the monitoring process, our Adviser analyzes monthly and quarterly financial statements versus the previous periods and year and budgeted performance, reviews future financial projections, meets
with management, attends board meetings and reviews all compliance certificates and covenants. 
Focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. We structure our customized
loan investments on a conservative basis with high cash yields, first and/or second lien security interests where possible, cash origination fees and lower relative leverage levels. We seek strong
debt investment protections for our customized debt investments, including default penalties, information rights, board observation rights, and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as
lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. We believe these protections will reduce our risk of capital loss. 


 6

   


Invest Across Multiple Companies, Industries, Regions and End Markets. We seek to maintain a
portfolio of investments that is appropriately balanced among various companies, industries, geographic regions and end markets. This portfolio balance is intended to mitigate the potential effects of
negative economic events for particular companies, regions, industries and end markets. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort. 


 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 
        The "Investment Portfolio", as used herein, refers to all of our investments in LMM portfolio companies, investments in Middle Market portfolio companies, Private Loan portfolio investments and Other Portfolio investments. Our LMM portfolio investments primarily consist of secured debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held, LMM companies based in the United States. Our Middle Market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in privately held companies based in the United States that are generally larger in size than the companies included in our LMM portfolio. Our Private Loan portfolio investments primarily consist of investments in interest-bearing debt securities in companies that are consistent with the size of companies in our LMM portfolio or our Middle Market portfolio, but are investments that we originate on a collaborative basis with other investment funds, and are often referred to in the debt markets as "club deals." Our Other Portfolio investments primarily consist of investments that are not consistent with the typical profiles for our LMM, Middle Market and Private Loan portfolio investments, including investments which may be managed by third parties. In our Other Portfolio, we may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by third parties, such as investments in other investment companies or private funds. 



Debt Investments 

        Historically, we have made LMM debt investments principally in the form of single tranche debt. Single tranche debt financing involves issuing one debt security that blends the risk and return profiles of both first lien secured and subordinated debt. We believe that single tranche debt is more appropriate for many LMM companies given their size in order to reduce structural complexity and potential conflicts among creditors. 
        Our LMM debt investments generally have a term of five to seven years from the original investment date, with limited required amortization prior to maturity, and provide for monthly or quarterly payment of interest at interest rates generally between 10% and 14% per annum, payable currently in cash. Interest rate terms can include either fixed or floating rate terms. In addition, certain LMM debt investments may have a form of interest that is not paid currently but is accrued and added to the loan balance and paid at maturity. We refer to this form of interest as payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest. We typically structure our LMM debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our total return target. In most cases, our LMM debt investment will be collateralized by a first priority lien on substantially all the assets of the portfolio company. In addition to seeking a senior lien position in the capital structure of our LMM portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our LMM debt investments by negotiating covenants that are designed to protect our LMM debt investments while affording our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as is reasonable. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control or change of management provisions, key-man life insurance, guarantees, equity pledges, personal guaranties, where appropriate, and put rights. In addition, we, through our Adviser, typically seek board representation or observation rights in all of our LMM portfolio companies. Interest rate terms can include either fixed or floating rate terms. 
        While we will continue to focus our LMM debt investments primarily on single tranche debt investments, we also anticipate structuring some of our debt investments as mezzanine loans. We expect that these mezzanine loans will be primarily junior secured or unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high interest rates, payable currently in cash, and will provide us with significant interest income. We also anticipate that these mezzanine loans will afford us the additional opportunity for income and gains through PIK interest and equity warrants and other similar equity instruments issued in conjunction with these 
 7

   mezzanine loans. These loans typically will have interest-only payments in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to the later years of the mezzanine loan term. Typically, our mezzanine loans will have maturities of three to five years. We will generally target interest rates of 12% to 14%, payable currently in cash, for our mezzanine loan investments with higher targeted total returns from equity warrants or PIK interest. 
        We also pursue debt investments in Middle Market companies. Our Middle Market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct investments or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in privately held companies based in the United States that are generally larger in size than the companies included in our LMM portfolio. Our Middle Market portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date. The debt investments in our Middle Market portfolio have rights and protections that are similar to those in our LMM debt investments, which may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions, guarantees and equity pledges. The Middle Market debt investments generally have floating interest rates at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin and are typically subject to LIBOR floors. 
        Our Private Loan portfolio investments primarily consist of investments in interest-bearing debt securities in companies that are consistent with the size of companies in our LMM portfolio or our Middle Market portfolio, but are investments which have been originated through strategic relationships with other investment funds on a collaborative basis. Our Private Loan portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date. 
 


Warrants 

        In connection with our debt investments, we may occasionally receive equity warrants to establish or increase our equity interest in the portfolio company. Warrants we receive in connection with a debt investment typically require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We typically structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as secured or unsecured put rights, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In certain cases, we also may obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and "piggyback" registration rights. 
 


Direct Equity Investments 

        We also will seek to make direct equity investments in situations where it is appropriate to align our interests with key management and stockholders of our LMM portfolio companies, and to allow for participation in the appreciation in the equity values of our LMM portfolio companies. We usually make our direct equity investments in connection with debt investments in our LMM portfolio companies. In addition, we may have both equity warrants and direct equity positions in some of our LMM portfolio companies. We, on a combined basis together with affiliates of and other investment funds managed by our Adviser, seek to maintain fully diluted equity positions in our LMM portfolio companies of 5% to 50%, and may have controlling equity interests in some instances. We have a value orientation toward our direct equity investments and have traditionally been able to purchase our equity investments at reasonable valuations. 
   INVESTMENT PROCESS 
        The Main Street investment committee the ("Investment Committee") has oversight over all aspects of our investment processes. The current members of the Investment Committee are Dwayne L. Hyzak, our Chief Executive Officer, David Magdol, our President and Chief Investment Officer, and Vincent D. Foster, Main Street's Executive Chairman. 
 8

          Our Adviser's investment processes for LMM and Middle Market portfolio investments are outlined below. The investment processes for Private Loan portfolio investments, from origination to close and to eventual exit, follow the processes for our LMM portfolio investments or our Middle Market portfolio investments as outlined below, or a combination thereof. Our Adviser's investment strategy involves a "team" approach, whereby potential transactions are screened by several members of one of our Adviser's investment teams before being presented to the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee meets on an as-needed basis depending on transaction volume. Our Adviser generally categorizes our investment process into seven distinct stages: 
 


Deal Generation/Origination 

        Deal generation and origination is maximized through our Adviser's long-standing and extensive relationships with industry contacts, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, entrepreneurs, service providers such as lawyers, financial advisers and accountants, and current and former portfolio companies and investors. Our Adviser's investment team has focused its deal generation and origination efforts on LMM and Middle Market companies, and our Adviser has developed a reputation as a knowledgeable, reliable and active source of capital and assistance in these markets. 
 


Screening 

        During the screening process, if a transaction initially meets our investment criteria, our Adviser will perform preliminary due diligence, taking into consideration some or all of the following information:
 

 a comprehensive financial model based on quantitative analysis of historical financial performance, projections and pro forma adjustments to
determine the estimated internal rate of return; 
 a brief industry and market analysis; 
 direct industry expertise imported from other portfolio companies or investors; 
 preliminary qualitative analysis of the management team's competencies and backgrounds; 
 potential investment structures and pricing terms; and 
 regulatory compliance. 

        Upon successful screening of a proposed LMM transaction, the investment team makes a recommendation to the Investment Committee. If the Investment Committee concurs with moving forward on the proposed LMM transaction, a non-binding term sheet is typically issued to the company. For Middle Market portfolio investments, the initial term sheet is typically issued by the borrower, through the syndicating bank, and is screened by the investment team which makes a recommendation to our Investment Committee. 
 


Term Sheet 

        For proposed LMM transactions, the non-binding term sheet will include the key economic terms based upon our analysis performed during the screening process, as well as a proposed timeline and our qualitative expectation for the transaction. While the term sheet for LMM investments is non-binding, an expense deposit is typically received in order to move the transaction to the due diligence phase. Upon execution of a term sheet, our Adviser begins our formal due diligence process. 
        For proposed Middle Market transactions, the initial term sheet will include key economic terms and other conditions proposed by the borrower and its representatives and the proposed timeline for the investment, which are reviewed by the investment team to determine if such terms and conditions are in agreement with our investment objectives. 
 9

   


Due Diligence 

        Due diligence on a proposed LMM investment is performed by a minimum of three of our Adviser's investment professionals, whom we refer to collectively as the investment team, and certain external resources, who together conduct due diligence to understand the relationships among the prospective portfolio company's business plan, operations and financial performance. Our Adviser's LMM due diligence review includes some or all of the following:
 


 site visits with management and key personnel; 
 detailed review of historical and projected financial statements; 
 operational reviews and analysis; 
 interviews with customers and suppliers; 
 detailed evaluation of company management, including background checks; 
 review of material contracts; 
 in-depth industry, market and strategy analysis; 
 evaluation of the company's environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices for alignment with our expectations; 
 regulatory compliance analysis; and 
 review by legal, environmental or other consultants, if applicable. 


        Due diligence on a proposed Middle Market investment is generally performed on materials and information obtained from certain external resources and assessed internally by a minimum of two of our Adviser's investment professionals, who work to understand the relationships among the prospective portfolio company's business plan, operations and financial performance using the accumulated due diligence information. Our Adviser's Middle Market due diligence review includes some or all of the following:
 


 detailed review of historical and projected financial statements; 
 in-depth industry, market, operational and strategy analysis; 
 evaluation of the company's environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices for alignment with our expectations; 
 regulatory compliance analysis; and 
 detailed review of the company's management team and their capabilities. 


        During the due diligence process, significant attention is given to sensitivity analyses and how the company might be expected to perform given downside, base-case and upside scenarios. In certain cases, we may decide not to make an investment based on the results of the diligence process. 
 


Document and Close 

        Upon completion of a satisfactory due diligence review of a proposed LMM portfolio investment, the investment team presents the findings and a recommendation to the Investment Committee. The presentation contains information which can include, but is not limited to, the following:
 


 company history and overview; 
 transaction overview, history and rationale, including an analysis of transaction strengths and risks; 
 analysis of key customers and suppliers and key contracts; 
 a working capital analysis; 


 10




 an analysis of the company's business strategy; 
 a management and key equity investor background check and assessment; 
 third-party accounting, legal, environmental or other due diligence findings; 
 investment structure and expected returns; 
 anticipated sources of repayment and potential exit strategies; 
 pro forma capitalization and ownership; 
 an analysis of historical financial results and key financial ratios; 
 sensitivities to management's financial projections; 
 regulatory compliance analysis findings; and 
 detailed reconciliations of historical to pro forma results.

 an analysis of historical financial results and key financial ratios. 


        If any adjustments to the transaction terms or structures are proposed by the Investment Committee, such changes are made and applicable analyses are updated prior to approval of the transaction. Approval for the transaction must be made by the affirmative vote from a majority of the members of the Investment Committee, with the committee member managing the transaction, if any, abstaining from the vote. Upon receipt of transaction approval, the investment team will re-confirm regulatory compliance, process and finalize all required legal documents, and fund the investment. 
 


Post-Investment 

        Our Adviser continuously monitors the status and progress of our portfolio companies. Our Adviser generally offers managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, giving them access to our investment experience, direct industry expertise and contacts. The same investment team that was involved in the investment process will continue its involvement in the portfolio company post-investment. This provides for continuity of knowledge and allows the investment team to maintain a strong business relationship with key management of our portfolio companies for post-investment assistance and monitoring purposes. 
        As part of the monitoring process of LMM portfolio investments, the investment team will analyze monthly and quarterly financial statements versus the previous periods and year, review financial projections, meet and discuss issues or opportunities with management, attend board meetings and review all compliance certificates and covenants. While the investment team maintains limited involvement in the ordinary course operations of our LMM portfolio companies, the investment team maintains a higher level of involvement in 
 11

   non-ordinary course financing or strategic activities and any non-performing scenarios. The investment team also monitors the performance of our Middle Market portfolio investments; however, due to the larger size and higher sophistication level of these Middle Market companies in comparison to our LMM portfolio companies, it is not necessary or practical to have as much direct management interface. 
        Our Adviser utilizes an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each LMM portfolio company and to monitor our expected level of returns on each of our LMM investments in relation to our expectations for the portfolio company. The investment rating system takes into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, each investment's expected level of returns, the collectability of our debt investments and the ability to receive a return of the invested capital in our equity investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants, the portfolio company's future outlook and other factors that are deemed to be significant to the portfolio company. 
 


Exit Strategies/Refinancing 

        While we generally exit most investments through the refinancing or repayment of our debt and redemption or sale of our equity positions, our Adviser typically assists our LMM portfolio companies in developing and planning exit opportunities, including any sale or merger of our portfolio companies. Our Adviser may also assist in the structure, timing, execution and transition of the Adviser's exit strategy. The refinancing or repayment of Middle Market debt investments typically does not require our assistance due to the additional resources available to these larger, Middle Market companies. 
   DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO VALUATION PROCESS 
        We determine the net asset value per share of our common stock on a quarterly basis. The net asset value per share is equal to our total assets minus total liabilities divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. 
        We are required to report our investments at fair value. As a result, the most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our Investment Portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. We follow the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal market that are independent, knowledgeable and willing and able to transact. 
        We determine in good faith the fair value of our Investment Portfolio pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with ASC 820 and a valuation process approved by our Board of Directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policies and processes are intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of our Investment Portfolio. See "Note 2  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures. 
        Due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our Investment Portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 
 12

          As described below, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments, with our Board of Directors having final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value for our Investment Portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. In addition, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors periodically evaluates the performance and methodologies of the financial advisory services firm that we consult in connection with valuing our LMM and Private Loan portfolio company investments. 
 


 Our quarterly valuation process begins with each LMM and Private Loan portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment
team of our Adviser responsible for monitoring the portfolio investment; 
 The fair value determination for our Middle Market and Other Portfolio debt and equity investments consists of unobservable and observable
inputs which are initially reviewed by the investment professionals of our Adviser responsible for monitoring the portfolio investment; 
 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then reviewed by and discussed with our Adviser and our senior management, and the applicable investment
team considers and assesses, as appropriate, any changes that may be required to the preliminary valuations to address any comments provided by senior management; 
 A nationally recognized independent financial advisory services firm analyzes and provides observations, recommendations and an assurance
certification regarding the determinations of the fair value for our LMM and Private Loan portfolio companies; 
 The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews valuations, and the applicable investment team and our senior management consider and
assess, as appropriate, any changes that may be required to valuations to address any comments provided by the Audit Committee; and 
 The Board of Directors assesses the valuations and ultimately approves the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. 


        Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial results and financial condition. 
   COMPETITION 
        We compete for investments with a number of investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds, BDCs, and SBICs), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of financing. Many of the entities that compete with us are larger and have more resources available to them. We believe we are able to be competitive with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our Adviser and our ability to co-invest with Main Street and its affiliates, our general focus on smaller companies in both the lower middle market and middle market, which we believe to be undeserved by other capital providers, our Adviser's responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, our comprehensive suite of customized financing solutions and the investment terms we offer. 
        We believe that some of our competitors make senior secured loans, junior secured loans and subordinated debt investments with interest rates and returns that are comparable to or lower than the rates and returns that we target. Therefore, we do not seek to compete primarily on the interest rates and returns that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see "Risk Factors  Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure  We face increasing competition for investment opportunities."

     STAFFING 
        We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the future. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees or affiliates of the Adviser, which is wholly owned by Main Street, pursuant to the terms of our Investment Advisory Agreement. Each of our executive officers is an employee or affiliate of the Adviser. Our day-to-day investment activities are managed by the Adviser. The services necessary for the origination and monitoring of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by Main Street. As of December 31, 2020, Main Street had 76 employees, 48 of whom it categorizes as investment and portfolio management professionals, and the others include operations professionals and administrative staff. Because we have no employees, we do not have a formal employee relations policy. 
 REGULATION 
 


Regulation as a Business Development Company 

        We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of the members of the board of directors of a BDC be persons other than "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
        The 1940 Act defines "a majority of the outstanding voting securities" as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities. 
 


Qualifying Assets 

        Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company's total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following: 
 

(1)Securities
purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an
eligible portfolio company (as defined below), or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other
person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC.
(2)Securities
of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
(3)Securities
purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions
incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due
without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
(4)Securities
of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60%
of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
(5)Securities
received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of
warrants or rights relating to such securities.
(6)Cash,
cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

 14

          In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. 
        An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 
 

(a)is
organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b)is
not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for
certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c)satisfies
any of the following:


(i)does
not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange or has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange but has
an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
(ii)is
controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
(iii)is
a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million. 





Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

        As noted above, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the type of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above under the heading entitled " Qualifying Assets." In addition, BDCs must generally offer to make available to such issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 
 


Temporary Investments 

        Pending investment in "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from time of investment therein, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. 
 


Senior Securities 

        Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, immediately after each such issuance is at least equal to the percentage set forth in Section 61 of the 1940 Act that is applicable to us at such time. Prior to the enactment of the Small Business Credit Availability Act, or SBCAA, in March 2018, the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs was 200%. The SBCAA permits a BDC to be subject to an asset coverage requirement of 150% so long as it meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals and, in the case of an unlisted BDC, makes an offer to repurchase the shares of its stockholders as of the date of the requisite approval. Effectiveness of the reduced asset coverage requirements to a BDC requires approval by either (1) a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of such BDC's board of directors with effectiveness one year after the date of such approval or (2) a majority of the votes cast at a special or annual meeting of such BDC's stockholders at which a quorum is present, which is effective the day after such stockholder approval. We have not requested or obtained either such approval. In addition, while any senior securities 
 15

   remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage, provided that any such borrowings in excess of 5% of the value of our total assets would be subject to the asset coverage ratio requirements of the 1940 Act, even if for temporary or emergency purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors  Risks Related to BDCs  Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to and the way in which we raise additional capital." 
 


Common Stock 

        We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We have not sought or received stockholder authorization to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock. 
 


Code of Ethics 

        We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code's requirements. The code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Website at http://www.sec.gov.



Compliance Policies and Procedures 

        We and our Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and our Board of Directors is required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually to assess their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Board of Directors has designated Jason Beauvais as our Chief Compliance Officer. 
 


Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

        We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in a manner in which we believe is consistent with the best interest of our stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we generally vote against proposals that we expect would have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
        Our proxy voting decisions are made by the investment team which is responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that anyone involved in the decision-making process discloses to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict regarding a proxy vote of which he or she is aware. 
        Stockholders may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, 1300 Post Oak Boulevard, 8th Floor, Houston, Texas 77056. 
 16

   


Other 1940 Act Regulations 

        We are also prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 
        We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office. 
        We may be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 
 


Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance 

        We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements will affect us. For example:
 


 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify the
accuracy of the consolidated financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures; and 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting. 


        The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and have taken actions necessary to ensure that we comply with that law. 
 


Investment Adviser Regulations 

        Our Adviser is subject to regulation under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act establishes, among other things, record keeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on transactions between the adviser's account and an advisory client's account, limitations on transactions between the accounts of advisory clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. We and our Adviser may also be examined by the SEC from time to time for compliance with the Advisers Act. 
 


Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 

        We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our "investment company taxable income," which is generally our net ordinary taxable income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, and 90% of our tax-exempt income (the "Annual Distribution Requirement"). As part of maintaining RIC status, undistributed taxable income (subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S. federal excise tax) pertaining to a given fiscal year may be distributed up to 12 months subsequent to the end of that fiscal year, provided such dividends are declared on 
 17

   or prior to the later of (i) filing of the U.S. federal income tax return for the applicable fiscal year or (ii) the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the close of the year in which such taxable income was generated. 
        For any taxable year in which we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income or capital gains we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
        We are subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary taxable income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending December 31 in that calendar year and (3) any taxable income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (the "Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement"). Dividends declared and paid by us in a year will generally differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income, exclude amounts carried over into the following year, and include the distribution of prior year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current year. For amounts we carry over into the following year, we will be required to pay the 4% U.S. federal excise tax on the excess of 98% of our annual investment company taxable income and 98.2% of our capital gain net income over our distributions for the year. 
        In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
 


 continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans,
gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships," or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or
securities (the "90% Income Test"); and 
 diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year with:


 at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other
securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
 no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs,
(i) of one issuer, (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or
businesses or (iii) of certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships" (collectively, the "Diversification Tests"). 



        In order to comply with the 90% Income Test, we formed the Taxable Subsidiaries as wholly owned taxable subsidiaries for the primary purpose of permitting us to own equity interests in portfolio companies which are "pass-through" entities for tax purposes. Absent the taxable status of the Taxable Subsidiaries, a portion of the gross income from such portfolio companies would flow directly to us for purposes of the 90% Income Test. To the extent such income did not consist of income derived from securities, such as dividends and interest, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and, therefore, cause us to incur significant U.S. federal income taxes. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated with MSC Income Fund for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") purposes and are included in our consolidated financial statements, and the portfolio investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with MSC Income Fund for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, as a result of their ownership of the portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and any related tax assets and liabilities, are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. 
 18

          We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments issued with warrants and debt securities invested in at a discount to par), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash such as PIK interest, cumulative dividends or amounts that are received in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
        Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders in certain circumstances while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain "asset coverage" tests are met. See "Regulation  Regulation as a Business Development Company  Senior Securities." Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
        We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") regulations, distributions payable by us in cash or in shares of stock (at the stockholder's election) would satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance indicating that this rule will apply even where the total amount of cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than 20% of the total distribution. According to this guidance, if too many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, each such stockholder would receive a pro rata share of the total cash to be distributed and would receive the remainder of their distribution in shares of stock. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, our stock, or a combination thereof) as (i) ordinary income (including any qualified dividend income that, in the case of a noncorporate stockholder, may be eligible for the same reduced maximum tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains to the extent such distribution is properly reported by us as qualified dividend income and such stockholder satisfies certain minimum holding period requirements with respect to our stock) or (ii) long-term capital gain (to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend), to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. 
 


Failure to Qualify as a RIC 

        If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets). 
        If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. If we were subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, then distributions we make after being subject to such tax 
 19

   would be taxable to our stockholders and, provided certain holding period and other requirements were met, could qualify for treatment as "qualified dividend income" eligible for the maximum 20% rate (plus a 3.8% Medicare surtax, if applicable) applicable to qualified dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate taxpayers would be eligible for a dividends-received deduction on distributions they receive. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
