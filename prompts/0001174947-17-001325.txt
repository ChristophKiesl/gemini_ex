 These activities are conducted in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America. Historically, the Company’s operations related to these activities consisted solely of the business and operations of Steiner-Atlantic Corp. (“Steiner-Atlantic”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 On October 10, 2016, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Western State Design, Inc., (“Western State Design”), completed the acquisition (the “Western State Design Acquisition”) of substantially all the assets of Western State Design, LLC, a California-based distributor of commercial and industrial laundry equipment and related parts for new laundry facilities and to the replacement laundry market. In addition, on June 19, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Martin-Ray Laundry Systems, Inc. (“Martin-Ray”), completed the acquisition (the “Martin-Ray Acquisition”) of substantially all the assets of Martin-Ray Laundry Systems, Inc., a Colorado-based distributor of commercial and industrial laundry equipment and related parts for new laundry facilities and to the replacement laundry market. See “Buy and Build Growth Strategy” below for additional information regarding these acquisitions.
 In addition, the Company, through DRYCLEAN USA License Corp., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns the worldwide rights to the name DRYCLEAN USA® and licenses the right to use such name for a fee to retail dry cleaners in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America.
 The Company reports its results of operations through a single reportable segment, which includes the operations of Steiner-Atlantic as well as the operations of Western State Design since the closing of the Western State Design Acquisition on October 10, 2016 and the operations of Martin-Ray since the closing date of the Martin-Ray Acquisition on June 19, 2017.

 The Company sells an extensive line of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and steam and hot water boilers manufactured by others, as well as related replacement parts and accessories, and provides installation and maintenance services.
 The commercial and industrial laundry equipment distributed by the Company includes washroom, finishing, material handling, and mechanical equipment such as washers and dryers, tunnel systems and coin-operated machines, many of which are designed to reduce utility and water consumption. Finishing equipment distributed by the Company includes sheet feeders, flatwork ironers, automatic sheet folders, and stackers. Material handling equipment distributed by the Company includes

conveyor and rail systems. Mechanical equipment distributed by the Company includes boilers, hot water/steam systems, water reuse systems and air compressors.
 The dry cleaning equipment distributed by the Company includes commercial dry cleaning machines, most of which are designed to be environmentally friendly by not using perchloroethylene (“Perc”) in the dry cleaning process, and therefore eliminating the health and environmental concerns that Perc poses. This line of products also includes garment presses, finishing equipment, sorting and storage conveyors and accessories.
 Boiler products consist of high efficiency, low emission steam boilers, steam systems and hot water systems that are used in the laundry and dry cleaning industry for temperature control, heating, pressing and de-wrinkling, and in the healthcare industry, food and beverage industry, HVAC industry and in other industrial markets for sterilization, product sealing and other purposes.
 The Company also sells replacement parts and accessories for the products it sells and provides installation and maintenance services to its customers.
 The Company seeks to position and price the products that it sells to appeal to customers in each of the high-end, mid-range and value-priced markets, as the products are generally offered in a wide range of price points to address the needs of a diverse customer base. The Company believes that the portfolio of products that it sells affords the Company’s customers a “one-stop shop” for commercial, industrial and vended laundry and dry cleaning machines, boilers and accessories and that, as a result, the Company is able to attract and support potential customers who can choose from the Company’s broad product line.
 Buy-and-Build Growth Strategy
 The Company intends to grow using a “buy-and-build” strategy. The “buy” component of the strategy includes the consideration and pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions that would complement the Company’s existing business or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities for, or benefit, the Company. The Company is disciplined and conservative in its consideration of acquisitions and generally seeks to identify opportunities that fit certain financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy involves implementing a growth culture at acquired businesses based on the exchange of ideas and business concepts among the management teams of the Company and the acquired businesses as well as through certain additional initiatives, which may include investments in new locations, additional product lines, expanded service capabilities and advanced technologies. The Company generally seeks to structure acquisitions to include both cash and stock consideration. The Company believes the issuance of stock consideration aligns the interests of the sellers of the acquired businesses, who the Company seeks to maintain to continue to operate the acquired businesses, with those of our other stockholders. The sellers as well as other key individuals at the acquired businesses may also be provided with the opportunity to own shares of the Company’s common stock through equity-based plans of the Company.
 As previously described, on October 10, 2016, the Company completed the Western State Design Acquisition pursuant to which the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Western State Design, purchased substantially all the assets of Western State Design, LLC (“WSD”), a California-based distributor of commercial and industrial laundry equipment and related parts for new laundry facilities and to the replacement laundry market, for a purchase price consisting of $18.5 million in cash and 2,044,990 shares of the Company’s common stock. The cash consideration, which included $2.8 million which was placed in escrow for no less than 18 months after the closing date (subject to extension in certain circumstances), was financed through $12.5 million of borrowings under the credit facility entered into at the time and $6.0 million of proceeds from the sale of 1,290,323 shares of the Company’s common stock to Symmetric Capital II LLC (“Symmetric Capital II”) in a private placement transaction. Henry M. Nahmad, the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and controlling stockholder, is the Manager of, and may be deemed to control, Symmetric Capital II. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company, indirectly through Western State Design, also assumed certain of the liabilities of WSD.
 In addition, on June 19, 2017, the Company completed the Martin-Ray Acquisition pursuant to which the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Martin-Ray, purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Martin-Ray Laundry Systems, Inc. (“MRLS”), a Colorado-based distributor of commercial laundry equipment. The consideration for the transaction consisted of $2.0 million in cash, $400,000 of which was placed in escrow for no less than 18 months after the closing

date (subject to extension in certain circumstances), and 98,668 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company funded the cash consideration with cash on hand.
 On September 8, 2017, the Company and a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company would acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain of the liabilities of Tri-State Technical Services, Inc. (“Tri-State”), a Georgia-based distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and a provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial, and vended laundry industry. The consideration to be paid by the Company in connection with the acquisition consists of $8.25 million in cash (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments), of which $2.1 million will be deposited in an escrow account for no less than 24 months after the closing date (subject to extension in certain circumstances), and 338,115 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company intends to fund the cash consideration with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s existing credit facility. Consummation of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions. There is no assurance that the transaction will be consummated on the contemplated terms, when anticipated, or at all.
 
Customers and Markets
 The Company’s customer base consists of approximately 9,100 customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America. The Company’s commercial and industrial laundry equipment and boilers are sold primarily to laundry plants, hotels, motels, cruise lines, hospitals, hospital combines, nursing homes, government institutions, distributors, coin laundries and specialized users. Dry cleaning equipment is sold primarily to dry cleaning stores, chains and higher-end hotels.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support
 The Company employs sales personnel to market its products in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America. The Company has exclusive and nonexclusive distribution rights to market the products it sells. Sales orders for equipment and replacement parts and accessories are generally obtained by telephone, e-mail and fax inquiries originated by the customer or by the Company, from existing customer relationships and from newly formed customer relationships. The Company supports product sales through its websites and by advertising in trade publications, participating in trade shows and engaging in regional promotions and sales incentive programs.
 The Company seeks to establish customer satisfaction by offering:
 
· | an experienced sales and service organization;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | a comprehensive product offering;
--+----------------------------------


· | competitive pricing;
--+---------------------


· | maintenance of comprehensive and well-stocked inventories of replacement parts and accessories, often with same day or overnight availability; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company trains its employees to provide service and customer support. The Company uses in-person classroom training, instructional videos and vendor sponsored seminars to educate employees about product information. In addition, the Company’s technical staff has prepared training manuals, written in English and Spanish, relating to specific training procedures. The Company’s technical personnel are retrained as the Company believes to be necessary, including in connection with the development of new technology.

Foreign Sales
 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”) and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (“fiscal 2016”), revenues related to foreign sales totaled approximately $5.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, substantially all of which related to the sale of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and boilers to customers in Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America.
 All of the Company’s foreign sales require the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the United States dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which the Company’s customers are located, as well as the strength of the economies of the countries in which the Company’s customers are located.
 Sources of Supply
 The Company purchases commercial and industrial laundry products, dry cleaning machines, boilers and other products from a number of manufacturers and suppliers. Purchases from four manufacturers accounted for approximately 59% of the Company’s purchases for fiscal 2017, while purchases from three manufacturers accounted for approximately 68% of the Company’s purchases for fiscal 2016. The major manufacturers of the products sold by the Company are Pellerin Milnor Corporation, Chicago Dryer Company, Dexter Laundry, Inc., Alliance Laundry Systems, LLC, Cleaver Brooks Inc., E-Tech Inc., Fulton Thermal Corp., and Unipress Corporation. The Company has contracts with several of the manufacturers and suppliers of the products which the Company sells and has established, long-standing relationships with most of its manufacturers and suppliers. The Company has not historically experienced difficulty in purchasing products it distributes and believes that it has good working relationships with its manufacturers and suppliers. The Company further believes that such relationships provide the Company with certain competitive advantages, including exclusivity for certain products in certain areas and, in certain cases, favorable prices and terms. However, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain its relationships with any of its suppliers, and the loss of certain of these relationships, including the loss of a relationship with one of the Company’s principal suppliers, could adversely affect the Company’s business and results.
 Due to special options and features on most of the larger and more expensive equipment ordered by customers, in most instances, the Company purchases the equipment sold by it after its receipt of orders from its customers. However, the Company also maintains an inventory of more standardized and smaller-sized equipment that often requires more rapid delivery to meet customer needs.
 Competition
 The commercial and industrial laundry, dry cleaning equipment and boiler distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented, with over 100 full-line or partial-line equipment distributors in the United States. The Company’s management believes that no one distributor has a major share of the market; substantially all distributors are independently owned; and, with the exception of several regional distributors, distributors operate primarily in local markets. In the United States market, the Company’s primary competition is from a number of full-line distributors and several manufacturers, which sell direct to the customer. In foreign markets, the Company also competes with several distributors and manufacturers. Competition is based primarily on price, product quality, and delivery and support services provided to the customer. In all geographic areas, the Company seeks to compete by offering an extensive product selection, value-added services, such as product inspection and quality assurance, a toll-free customer support line and technical websites, reliability, warehouse location, price, competitive special features and, with respect to certain products, exclusivity from the manufacturer.
Research and Development
 The Company’s research and development efforts and expenses are generally immaterial as most of the Company’s products are distributed for manufacturers that perform their own research and development.

Patents and Trademarks
 The Company is the owner of United States service mark registrations for the names EnviroStar® and for the name DRYCLEAN USA®, which is licensed by it to retail dry cleaning establishments. The Company intends to use and protect these or related service marks and tradenames, as necessary.
Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Laws and Regulations
 Over the past several decades, federal, state and local governments in the United States and various other countries have enacted environmental protection laws in response to public concerns about the environment, including with respect to Perc, the primary cleaning agent historically used in the commercial and industrial dry cleaning process. A number of industries, including the commercial and industrial dry cleaning and laundry equipment industries, are subject to these evolving laws and implementing regulations. As a supplier to the industry, the Company serves customers who are primarily responsible for compliance with environmental regulations. Among the United States federal laws that the Company believes are applicable to the industry are the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), which provides for the investigation and remediation of hazardous waste sites; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”), which regulates the generation and transportation of hazardous waste as well as its treatment, storage and disposal; and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act (“OSHA”), which regulates exposure to toxic substances and other health and safety hazards in the workplace. Most states and a number of local jurisdictions have laws that regulate the environment, which are at least as stringent as the federal laws.
 The Company does not believe that compliance with federal, state and local environmental and other laws and regulations which have been adopted have had, or will have, a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 Employees
 As of September 1, 2017, the Company had 138 employees. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.
