ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
China Changjiang Mining & New Energy Company, Ltd. (the "Company") is currently in the development stage with the goal of becoming a turnkey developer and Engineering, Procurement and Construction ("EPC") contractor of photovoltaic ("PV") solar energy facilities ("SEF"). We intend to design, engineer, construct, market and sell high-quality PV SEFs for commercial and utility applications to local markets. 
 
Before June 1, 2012, we were engaged in exploration for commercially recoverable metal-bearing mineral deposits. On June 1, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Xunyang Yongjin Mining Co., Ltd. to transfer our mining exploration rights for a cash payment of $2,380,612 (RMB 15,000,000). Further, on December 30, 2013, our subsidiary, Shaanxi Changjiang Mining & New Energy Co., Ltd ("Shaanxi Changjiang"), entered into Equity Transfer Agreements with each of Zhang Hong Jun, a director of the Company and owner of a controlling interest in the Company (holding 54.42% as of December 31, 2016), and Wang Sheng Li, a director and shareholder of the Company (holding 2.36% as of December 31, 2016), to sell Shaanxi Changjiang's entire 60% interest in Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd., ("East Mining" and formerly referred to as "Dongfang Mining") for a total consideration of $885,696 (RMB5,400,000). The consideration payable to the Company was used to offset amounts owed to each of the acquirers. Each of the acquirers obtained 30% equity in this transaction. 
 
Together with Mr. Zhang Hong Jun, a director of the Company and owner of a controlling interest in the Company, the Company established a subsidiary, named Shaanxi Weinan Changjiang Solar Photovoltaic Energy Applied Science and Technology Co., Ltd ("Changjiang PV"), to develop the new solar energy business in April 2012. We hold an indirect 51% interest in Changjiang PV. We and Mr. Zhang Hong Jun have invested in new energy industry for several years. With close relations with government departments and extensive personal connections, we devoted our major efforts to the solar photovoltaic downstream market after signing the mines disposing agreement in June 2012.
 
Our subsidiary, Changjiang PV, concentrates on the development and operation of EPC projects. Our first EPC project, the Weinan Hechuan 137KWp solar PV building applications did not generate any revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
We also hold land use rights in a land parcel and we lease a portion of the land use rights on the 5.7 square kilometer parcel to Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd (previously Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Spring Lake Park Co., Ltd.), a company with a common control person. The term of the lease agreement is from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2029 and the annual rent is approximately $1.2 million (RMB 7,500,000). As of December 31, 2016, we had only received rent payments for 2011 and no payments thereafter. Due to the uncertain collectability, we decided to write off all the receivable related to land lease of $3,618,818 (equivalent to RMB 22,500,000) in FY 2015 and decided not to recognize any revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. 
 
Our Corporate History and Background
 
The Company is the result of a 2008 share exchange transaction among: (i) North American Gaming and Entertainment Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("North American"); (ii) Shaanxi Changjiang Petroleum & Energy Development Stock Co., Ltd. ("CJP"), a limited liability company established and existing under the law of People's Republic of China; and (iii) the shareholders of CJP, among whom the predominant shareholder, holding 97.2% of CJP's shares, was a Hong Kong company, Hong Kong Wah Bon Enterprise Limited ("Wah Bon"). After completion of the share exchange transaction, the Company entered into a reverse merger with North American.

At the time of the share exchange transaction, CJP owned 60%, and the Company continues to control, Shaanxi East Mining Co., Ltd., ("East Mining") which held the Chinese exploration license through which we pursued our exploration activity. 
 
The share exchange was completed on February 4, 2008, resulting in the shareholders of CJP controlling approximately 96% of the equity ownership of North American. At the time of the closing of the share exchange, North American was a shell company domiciled in Delaware which filed reports under the Exchange Act and whose shares traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market. Wah Bon caused its subsidiary, CJP, to pay $370,000 in cash, and Wah Bon delivered shares constituting 97.2% of the outstanding equity of CJP, in exchange for 3,800,000 shares of North American common stock and 500,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock of North American, which originally were entitled to 1,218 votes per share. Two U.S. individuals, through their advisory company, Capital Advisory Services, Inc., were paid in the aggregate 4,500,000 shares of North American. In June 2008, CJP changed its name to "Shaanxi Changjiang Mining &New Energy Co., Ltd ("Shaanxi Changjiang")."
 
Following the share exchange transaction, Wah Bon replaced North American's Board of Directors.
 
China Changjiang Mining & New Energy Company, Ltd. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on September 19, 2008 for the purposes of re-domesticating the Company from Delaware to Nevada, adopting the Company's current name, and to serve as the surviving company of a reverse merger with North American.
 
Pursuant to Articles of Merger filed with the Secretary of the State of the State of Nevada on December 4, 2008 and the Secretary of the State of Delaware on April 2, 2009, North American was merged with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving entity.
 
On February 9, 2010, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of our common stock, subject to FINRA approval. The 1-for-10 reverse split was approved by FINRA on July 30, 2010, effective August 2, 2010. 
 
On September 15, 2010, the Company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State a Certificate of Designation and a Certificate of Conversion and Elimination of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, pursuant to which: (i) all shares of our Series C Preferred Stock were converted into shares of common stock at a rate of 1,218 shares of common stock for each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock; and (ii) we canceled and eliminated the Series C Preferred Stock. In the aggregate, the outstanding shares of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock were converted into 609 million shares of common stock.
 
As a result of these transactions, we currently have 250,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 64,629,559 shares are issued and outstanding on the date of this annual report, and 10,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, of which no shares are presently issued and outstanding. At the time our share exchange transaction was completed, approximately 96% of the outstanding shares of North American were owned by Wah Bon. See Item 12, "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters."
 
We established a subsidiary, named Shaanxi Weinan Changjiang Solar Photovoltaic Energy Applied Science and Technology Co., Ltd. ("Changjiang PV"), in April 2012 to develop the new solar energy business. Our subsidiary, Shaanxi Changjiang, owns 51% of Changjiang PV, and Mr. Zhang Hong Jun, the actual controller, owns the other 49%.
 
On December 30, 2013, we transferred all of the 60% equity of East Mining to our common control person, Mr. Zhang Hong Jun and one of the shareholders, Mr. Wang Sheng Li with a consideration of $885,696 (RMB 5,400,000). Each of the acquirers obtained 30% equity of East Mining in this transaction.
 
Shaanxi Changjiang held 20% equity of Shaanxi Changjiang Electricity & New Energy Co., Ltd from 2008, with an investment cost of $315,658 (RMB 2, 000,000) and impairment of $183,429 was provided at the year ended December 31, 2013. On December 31, 2014 Shaanxi Changjiang disclaimed this 20% equity interest in exchange for a waiver of the debt of $201,899 owed to Shaanxi Changjiang Electricity & New Energy Co., Ltd.

Our organization chart as of December 31, 2016 is illustrated as follows.
 


Industry overview
 
Solar photovoltaic energy is an emerging, clean energy industry with a growing market share. The global solar PV market has grown from 6.1 Gigawatt ("GW") in 2008 to an estimated 49.7GW in 2014 but with imbalanced development. Application of solar energy in developed countries such as Germany and Japan, are relatively comprehensive and mature. At the present time, the Chinese PV downstream market is still in the initial stages of development, though most of the PV modules are manufactured in China.
 
In the past year, China's solar PV module manufacturers were hit by the European Union and the United States anti-dumping sanctions. Businesses and governments are trying to find better alternative applications market to absorb the huge domestic surplus solar PV capacity. The untapped domestic PV downstream market is one of the best ways to absorb the surplus production capacity.
 
The Chinese government is encouraging the construction of a large PV base and the development of distributed photovoltaic. Currently, we mainly focus on the development of distributed photovoltaic power generation projects.
 
It was estimated that, by 2020, if the Building Integrated PV ("BIPV") would be applied for 10% of the roof area and 15% of the facade area in the existing and new buildings in China, the potential market of BIPV applications would reach 1000GW, equivalent to 45 new installed capacity of the Three Gorges Hydropower Station.
 
Since the first half of 2012, the supply and demand of silicon in the international market has undergone great changes, resulting in obvious decline in the cost of solar modules. With the declining cost of solar modules from RMB 15 to RMB 6 per watt, the cost of PV power generation was significantly reduced.
 
We believe the next few years will show protracted continued growth in the PV solar market. Government policies, in the form of both regulation and incentives, have accelerated the adoption of solar technologies by businesses and consumers and have provided opportunities for developers to construct PV systems as an alternative to more traditional forms of power generation.

Our Industry and Principal Market
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We have established a sales and marketing department which is focused on identifying and establishing relationships with entities that are likely to have a need for our products and services.
 
Our products and services are expected to be largely represented through our Company's sales force located in Xi'an City and Weinan City, Shaanxi Province, China.
 
Current Business Operations
 
At the present time, our focus is on serving the local solar PV generation market. 
 
According to the national policy and because of the favorable market conditions, Weinan City is to develop photovoltaic power generation demonstration area. Weinan city is a prosperous city, adjacent to the capital of Shaanxi province, Xian city. With rich solar radiation and developed business in the Northwest, Weinan city took advantage to accelerate the development of the distributed solar PV.
 
We established a subsidiary, named Shaanxi Weinan Changjiang Solar Photovoltaic Energy Applied Science and Technology Co., Ltd. ("Changjiang PV"), in April 2012 to develop the local distributed solar PV business.
 
The following chart illustrates our distributed solar PV business model.
 


In September 2012, Changjiang PV entered into an agreement with Shaanxi Changling Solar Energy & Electric Co., Ltd ("Changling") to outsource the construction of a solar energy project located in Huanghe Bay Springs Lake Theme Park. The project, with a total contract amount of $310,548, was completed by the year end of 2012.
 
The project was designed to generate electricity preferentially for Huanghe, and sell the surplus power to the grid company. We have received the subsidy funds of $159,096 (RMB 1,000,000) from the local government for the project in December, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Huanghe Bay Project did not generate any revenue.
 
We also hold land use rights in a 5.7 square kilometer parcel located in Huanghe Nantan, Heyang County, in the Shaanxi Province of China. And we lease a portion of the land use rights on the 5.7 square kilometer parcel to Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd (previously Shaanxi Huanghe Bay Spring Lake Park Co., Ltd.), a company with a common control person. The term of the lease agreement is from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2029 and the annual rent is approximately $1.2 million (RMB 7,500,000). As of December 31, 2016, we had only received rent payments for 2011 and no payments thereafter. Due to the uncertain collectability, we decided to write off all the receivable related to land lease of $3,618,818 (equivalent to RMB 22,500,000) in FY 2015 and decided not to recognize any revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.

Solar PV Industry
 
General
 
Though we may be a new participant in solar PV industry, we also realized that the local downstream market of solar PV industry was as new as we are. Experience in some developed countries has shown that there should be a business opportunity in China's PV downstream market in the near future.
 
Each of our EPC projects is a strategic long-term investment, with relatively low risk, a stable cash inflow can be generated and little ongoing maintenance costs would be incurred once the project begins operations.
 
Competition
 
We anticipate that our competitors in the solar PV markets will be local and regional EPC contractors and developers. Other companies in China that engage in solar PV power generation that we consider to be likely competitors, include: Xi'an Huanghe Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Tuori New Energy Technology Limited, and Shaanxi Changling Electric Co., Ltd., etc. These competitors have more experience in the operation of solar PV energy and have superior financial resources than we do. 
 
The entire solar industry also faces competition from other power generation sources, both conventional sources as well as other emerging technologies. Solar power has certain advantages and disadvantages when compared to other power generating technologies. The advantages include the ability to deploy products in many sizes and configurations, provide reliable power for many applications, serve as both a power generator and the skin of a building and eliminate air, water and noise emissions. The disadvantages mainly came from the relatively high cost of power generation.
 
The cost of electricity generated by PV products currently is very close to the cost of electricity generated from conventional power such as coal and hydropower in Chinese markets. A significant reduction in the scope or discontinuation of government incentive programs could cause demand for our products and our revenue to decline, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 
As an emerging industry, the rapid growth of the solar PV could reduce the intensity of competition from alternative products and services.
 
In the near term, mature government subsidy roadmaps from the government have led developers to be aggressive with their solar installations so that they can enjoy better economic returns. Cost reductions of solar installations have proven to be viable and have also led to aggressive solar installation. In the long run, we believe that solar energy continues to have significant future growth potential and that demand for our products and services will continue to grow significantly for the following reasons:
 

· | increasing demand for renewable energies, including solar energy, due to the finiteness of fossil fuels and concerns over nuclear power; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | increasing environmental awareness leading to regulations and taxes aimed at limiting emissions from fossil fuels; 
· | continued adoption or maintenance of government incentives for solar energy at all level of Chinese government; 
· | narrowing cost differentials between solar energy and conventional energy sources due to market-wide decreases in the average selling prices for PV products driven by lower raw materials costs and increased production efficiencies; and
· | continued improvements in the conversion efficiency of PV products leading to lower costs per watt of electricity generated, making solar energy more efficient and cost-effective.

On September 4, 2006, China's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Construction jointly promulgated the Interim Measures for Administration of Special Funds for Application of Renewable Energy in Building Construction, which provides that the Ministry of Finance will arrange special funds to support the application of renewable energy in building construction in order to enhance building energy efficiency, protect the ecological environment and reduce the consumption of fossil energy. These special funds provide significant support for the application of solar energy in hot water supply, refrigeration and heating, PV technology and lighting integrated into building construction materials.
 
On October 28, 2007, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted amendments to the PRC Energy-saving Law, which sets forth policies to encourage the conservation of energy in manufacturing, civic buildings, transportation, government agents and utilities sectors. The amendments also seek to expand the use of the solar energy in construction areas.
 
In March 2009, China's Ministry of Finance promulgated the Interim Measures for Administration of Government Subsidy Funds for Application of Solar Photovoltaic Technology in Building Construction, or the Interim Measures, to support the demonstration and the promotion of solar PV applications in China. Local governments are encouraged to issue and implement supporting policies for the development of solar PV technology. These Interim Measures set forth subsidy funds set at RMB 20 per watt for 2009 to cover solar PV systems integrated into building construction that have a minimum capacity of 50 kilowatt peak.
 
In April 2009, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development jointly issued the "Guidelines for Declaration of Demonstration Project of Solar Photovoltaic Building Applications." These guidelines created a subsidy of up to RMB 20 per watt for building integrated PV or BIPV projects using solar-integrated building materials and components and up to RMB 15 per watt for BIPV projects using solar-integrated materials for rooftops or walls.
 
In July 2010, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development issued the "City Illumination Administration Provisions" or the Illumination Provision. The Illumination Provisions encourage the installation and use of renewable energy system such as PV systems in the process of construction and re-construction of city illumination projects.
 
On March 8, 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development jointly promulgated the Notice on Further Application of Renewable Energy in Building Construction, which aims to raise the percentage of renewable energy used in buildings.

On March 14, 2012, the Ministry of Finance, the NDRC and the National Energy Bureau jointly issued the interim measures for the management of additional subsidies for renewable-energy power prices, according to which relevant renewable-energy power generation enterprises are entitled to apply for subsidies for their renewable power generation projects that satisfy relevant requirements set forth in the measures.
 
On March 1, 2013, China's State Council issued the "Twelfth Five Year Plan." The plan supports the promotion and development of renewable energy, including the solar energy. The plan also encourages the development of solar PV power stations in the areas with abundant solar power resource.
 
On November 18, 2013, the National Energy Bureau issued "The Interim Measures for the management of distributed photovoltaic power generation projects". The regulation contributes to promote the application of distributed photovoltaic power and regulate the projects management.
 
On November 26, 2013, the Ministry of Finance announced that the power generated by its own distributed PV power generation project could be exempted from imposing government fee, such as renewable energy surcharges, fee for major national water conservancy construction, etc.
 
In January, 2014, the National Energy Administration of China announced the PV installation target for 2014 to be 14GW, which includes 8GW for distributed PV systems and 6GW for large scale PV power plants.
 

10

 
In the same month, the National Energy Administration of China released a list of 81 "New Energy Demonstration Cities" and eight "industrial demonstration parks" in 28 and 8 provinces respectively. These cities and zones are required to achieve their respective mandatory targets in terms of solar PV installations and the percentage of installed renewable energy power generation capacities by the end of 2015, or the end of the 12th Five-Year-Plan.
 
In February 2014, the Certification and Accreditation Administration and the National Energy Administration jointly issued the "Implementation Opinions on Strengthening the Testing and Certification of PV Products." The implementation opinions provide that only certified PV products may be connected to the public grid or receive government subsidies. The institutions that certify PV products must be approved by the Certification and Accreditation Administration. According to the implementation opinions, PV products that are subject to certification include PV battery parts, inverters, control devices, confluence devices, energy storage devices and independent PV systems.
 
In December, 2014, the National Energy Administration of China released a list of 30 "distributed solar photovoltaic industrial application demonstration zone" to encourage the development of distributed solar PV industry.
 
On January 28, 2015, the NEA of China announced the target for national solar installations in 2015 to be 15GW, 8GW of which would be targeted for utility scale, 7GW for distributed generation.
 
On December 24, 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission promulgated the Notice on the improvement of photovoltaic electricity price, which announced a new standard on-grid price implemented from January 1, 2016 for solar PV electricity.
 
On December 15, 2015, the National Energy Bureau announced the annual plan for the development of solar PV. The solar power installed capacity will reach 160GW, and total annual investment will reach 200 billion RMB for 2016, in the light of the plan.
 
Restrictions on Foreign Businesses and Investments
 
The principal regulation governing foreign ownership of photovoltaic businesses in the PRC is the Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue, updated and effective as of January 30, 2012. Under this regulation, industrial activity is categorized as "permitted," "restricted," or "prohibited." and the solar photovoltaic business is listed as an industry of "permitted" where foreign investments are encouraged.
Enterprise Income Tax
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People's Congress passed the Enterprise Income Tax Law ("the China EIT Law"), which was effective as of January 1, 2008.
 
The China EIT Law also provides that an enterprise established under the laws of foreign countries or regions but whose "de facto management body" is located in the PRC be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purpose and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax at the rate of 25% for its worldwide income. The Implementing Rules of the new EIT Law merely defines the location of the "de facto management body" as "the place where the exercising, in substance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties, etc., of a non-PRC company is located." On April 22, 2009, the PRC State Administration of Taxation further issued a notice entitled "Notice regarding Recognizing Offshore-Established Enterprises Controlled by PRC Shareholders as Resident Enterprises Based on Their place of Effective Management." Under this notice, a foreign company controlled by a PRC company or a group of PRC companies shall be deemed as a PRC resident enterprise, if (i) the senior management and the core management departments in charge of its daily operations mainly function in the PRC; (ii) its financial decisions and human resource decisions are subject to decisions or approvals of persons or institutions in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company sales, minutes and files of board meetings and shareholders' meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) more than half of the directors or senior management personnel with voting rights reside in the PRC. Based on a review of surrounding facts and circumstances, the Company does not believe that it is likely that its operations outside of the PRC should be considered a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, due to limited guidance and implementation history of the China EIT Law, should the Company be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, the Company will be subject to PRC tax on worldwide income at a uniform tax rate of 25% retroactive to September 19, 2008.

11

 
The China EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside of China, if such immediate holding company is considered as a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China, unless such immediate holding company's jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Such withholding income tax was exempted under the previous income tax regulations. The United States of America, where the Company is incorporated, has such tax treaty with China.
 
Our Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of 11 employees, of whom 10 were full-time employees. This includes two people in marketing, three in maintenance and quality control, three in financial and accounting, and four in general management.
