Merger
On September 25, 2020 the Company and Dollar Mutual Bancorp (“Dollar”) announced they had entered into a definitive agreement under which Dollar will acquire the Company in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $158.0 million. The Company’s stockholders will receive $33.00 for each share of Company common stock that they own. The transaction was approved by the Company’s stockholders on January 19, 2021 and is expected to close in the first half of 2021. However, it is possible that factors outside the control of both companies, including whether or when the required regulatory approvals will be received, could result in the merger being completed at a different time or not at all. In connection with the acquisition, the Company had incurred $1.1 million ($1.0 million after tax) of merger-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily legal and investment banker costs, which are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Available Information
The Company maintains a website at www.standardbankpa.com. Copies of the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, amendments to those reports and proxy materials are available through that website, free of charge, as soon as is reasonably practical after the Company electronically files those materials with or furnishes them to the SEC. You may access those reports by following the links under “Investor Relations” at the Company’s website. Information on this website is not and should not be considered a part of this document.
Market Area
The Company, with total assets of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020, is the parent company of the Bank, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank which operates seventeen offices serving individuals and small to mid-sized businesses in Allegheny, Westmoreland, and Bedford counties in Pennsylvania and Allegany County in Maryland. The Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and an Equal Housing Lender.
The Bank’s market area has a broad range of private and public employers, and has transitioned from heavy industry to more specialized industries and service providers, including technology, health care, education, energy and finance. Westmoreland County is east of Allegheny County and is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Allegany County, Maryland is part of the Cumberland, Maryland-West Virginia metropolitan area, which is equidistant from Pittsburgh and Baltimore, and its economy includes information technology, biotechnology, medical services and manufacturing.
Unemployment rates have increased substantially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any significant reduction in the unemployment rate will be largely dependent on the rollout of the vaccines and the inoculation of a large percentage of the public.
Median household income, as a percentage change since 2010, for the Bank’s market area remains strong with the addition of higher paying technology and energy jobs. While in dollar terms each of the region’s median household income is lower than their respective states and the nation, the lower cost of living in the regions continue to offset some of the disparity. The Bank’s market area continues to be one of the most affordable housing markets in the country.
The population in the Bank’s market area as well as both Pennsylvania and Maryland has been relatively stable over the last several years while increasing at the national level. The median age in some counties in the Bank’s market area is significantly older than that of the nation and respective states. Areas outside of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania continue to increase in median age, however, the median age has declined in the greater Pittsburgh area due to neighborhood revitalization along with an influx of technology jobs that have attracted a younger demographic. Nonetheless, there remains a significant difference in the median age between some of the Bank’s market area and that of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the nation; the largest disparity being over eight years between Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania and the nation.

Competition
The Bank faces intense competition in its market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. The Bank competes with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and investment banking firms. Some of the Bank’s larger competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that the Bank does not or cannot provide.
The Bank’s deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding its community banking offices, located in the Pennsylvania counties of Allegheny, Westmoreland and Bedford and Allegany County, Maryland. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank ranked 16th in deposit market share out of 34 bank and thrift institutions with offices in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania with a market share of 0.3%, 9th in deposit market share out of 25 bank and thrift institutions in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania with a market share of 2.7%, 8th in deposit market share out of 9 bank and thrift institutions in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, with a market share of 3.2% and 4th in deposit market share out of 4 bank and thrift institutions in Allegany County, Maryland with a market share of 11.5%
Lending Activities
The Bank’s primary lending activities are the origination of commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. To a lesser extent, the Bank also originates construction loans and consumer loans.
Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2020, $375.6 million, or 50.6%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans. Properties securing the Bank’s commercial real estate loans primarily include loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings, lessors of non-residential buildings, properties for single family home construction, small office buildings and warehouse/industrial facilities. The Bank generally seeks to originate commercial real estate loans with initial principal balances not to exceed $6.0 million. Substantially all of the Bank’s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in its primary market area. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s largest commercial real estate loan relationship (consisting of two separate $4.0 million commercial real estate loans) had a combined principal balance of $8.0 million and was secured by one apartment complex and one commercial office building. These two loans were performing in accordance with their terms and conditions at December 31, 2020.
In the underwriting of commercial real estate loans, the Bank generally lends up to the lower of 80% of the property’s appraised value or purchase price. The Bank bases its decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, the Bank emphasizes the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a preferred ratio of 1.25x), computed after deductions for a vacancy factor and property expenses that the Bank deems appropriate. Personal guarantees are usually obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. The Bank generally requires title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect its security interest in the underlying property. Almost all of the Bank’s commercial real estate loans are generated internally by its Commercial Relationship Managers.
Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans Standard originates, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income generated from the property to cover both operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties.

4



Commercial Business Loans. The Bank makes various types of secured and unsecured commercial business loans to customers in its market area for working capital and other general business purposes. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of ten years. The loans are either negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to a market rate index. The Bank generally seeks to originate loans to small- and medium-size businesses with principal balances between $50,000 and $5.0 million. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had commercial business loans outstanding of $78.0 million, or 10.5% of the total loan portfolio. Included in the $78.0 million were Paycheck Protection Program loans of $37.7 million. See “The Paycheck Protection Program” for additional information.
Commercial credit decisions are based upon the Bank’s credit assessment of the loan applicant. The Bank evaluates the applicant’s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and the Bank assesses the risks involved. Personal guarantees of the principals are typically obtained. In addition to evaluating the loan applicant’s financial statements, the Bank considers the adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment for the loan and debt service coverage. Credit agency reports of the applicant’s personal credit history supplement the Bank’s analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness. Collateral supporting a secured transaction is also analyzed to determine its value and marketability. Commercial business loans generally carry higher interest rates than residential loans of like duration due to a higher risk of default as repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the sufficiency of any collateral. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s largest commercial business loan was to a municipality. The loan had a principal balance of $3.9 million and was secured by the full faith and credit and taxing authority of the borrower. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions at December 31, 2020.
One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans. At December 31, 2020, $192.4 million, or 25.9%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. The Bank offers fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. One- to four-family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to secondary market guidelines, and the Bank refers to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” The Bank generally originates both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is currently $548,250 for single-family homes. However, loans in excess of $548,250 (which are referred to as “jumbo loans”) are generally originated for retention in the Bank’s loan portfolio or may be sold servicing released. The Bank’s portfolio maximum loan amount for these loans is generally $750,000. The Bank underwrites jumbo portfolio loans in the same manner as conforming loans. Most of the Bank’s one- to four-family residential mortgage loan originations are generated by its mortgage loan officers.
The Bank will originate loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%, up to and including a loan-to-value ratio of 97%. The Bank requires private mortgage insurance for loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank originated $9.6 million of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80%. The Bank offers special programs for low- and moderate-income home purchasers within low to moderate income census tracts. The property must be located within the Bank’s lending assessment area. Household income must be less than 80% of the median income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area in order to qualify for the special low-to moderate-income program. Loans under this program may be originated up to an 89% loan-to-value. Under this program, for loans exceeding an 80% loan-to-value up to an 89% loan-to-value, mortgage insurance is not required if the borrower’s FICO scores are 700 or greater and the debt to income ratio does not exceed 45%.
The Bank generally sells fixed rate conforming loans with terms greater than 15 years and retains the servicing rights on loans sold to generate fee income. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank recognized loan servicing fees of $565,000. As of December 31, 2020, the principal balance of loans serviced for others totaled $116.1 million.
Other than the Bank’s loans for the construction of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans (described under “Construction Loans”) and home equity lines of credit (described under “Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit”), the Bank does not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). The Bank also does not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. The Bank does 

5



not offer “subprime loans” (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation).
Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. In addition to traditional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, the Bank offers home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary residence or secondary residence. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $96.1 million and represented 12.9% of the total loan portfolio. The Bank’s home equity loans are originated with fixed rates of interest and with terms of up to 15 years. Home equity lines of credit have a maximum term of 20 years. The Bank offers interest only lines of credit with a 10-year draw period in which interest is due monthly. After the initial 10-year draw period, the borrower is required to make principal and interest payments based on a 10-year amortization. The Bank’s home equity lines of credit are currently originated with adjustable rates of interest. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with the same criteria that the Bank uses to underwrite one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. For a borrower’s primary residence, home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 89.9% and 85.0%, respectively, when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. At the time the Bank closes a home equity loan or line of credit, the Bank records a mortgage to protect its security interest in the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2020 the Bank’s in-house maximum limit for home equity loans and lines of credit was $750,000. Loans over $400,000 require title insurance.
Home equity loans and lines of credit entail greater credit risks compared to the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans the Bank originates, as they typically involve higher loan-to-value ratios. Therefore, any decline in real estate values may have a more detrimental effect on home equity loans and lines of credit compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
Construction Loans. The Bank makes commercial construction loans for rental properties, commercial buildings and homes built by developers on speculative, undeveloped property. The terms of commercial construction loans are made in accordance with the Bank’s commercial loan policy. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but are generally limited to an 80% loan-to-completed-appraised-value ratio. Repayment of construction loans on non-residential properties is normally expected from the property’s eventual rental income, income from the borrower’s operating entity or the sale of the subject property. In the case of income-producing property, repayment is usually expected from permanent financing upon completion of construction. The Bank typically provides the permanent mortgage financing on construction loans. Construction loans are interest-only loans during the construction period, which typically do not exceed 12 months, and convert to permanent, amortizing financing following the completion of construction. At December 31, 2020, commercial construction loans totaled $7.8 million and are included with commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2020, the additional un-advanced portion of these construction loans totaled $2.4 million.
The Bank makes residential construction loans for one- to four-family owner-occupied properties. Advances on residential construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction. The terms of residential construction loans are made in accordance with the Bank’s one- to four-family residential lending policy (described under “One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Loans”). At December 31, 2020, residential construction loans totaled $200,000 and are included with one-to-four family residential and construction loans. At December 31, 2020, the additional un-advanced portion of these construction loans totaled $300,000.
Generally, before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, the Bank requires an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. The Bank reviews and inspects properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. In the event the 

6



Bank makes a land acquisition loan on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is the risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also expose the Bank to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated.
Loan Originations, Sales, Participations and Servicing. All loans that the Bank originates are underwritten pursuant to its policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting and secondary market guidelines. The Bank originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. The Bank’s loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Bank sold approximately 86.4% or $68.4 million of the fixed rate one-to-four family mortgage loans it originated. Of that total, 93.7% or $64.1 million had terms greater than 15 years. The loans were originated by the Bank and sold on the secondary market as well as to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (“FHLB”) through its Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) program. The Bank also receives fees related to the referral of a loan to a secondary market lender whereby the Bank does not originate the loan. In 2020, the Bank referred $2.2 million of fixed rate one-to-four family mortgage loans. The Bank determines on a loan by loan basis whether or not to retain the loan servicing rights. At December 31, 2020, the Bank was servicing one-to-four family mortgage loans owned by others with a principal balance of $116.1 million. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. The Bank retains a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans it services as consideration for servicing activities.
From time to time, banks enter into participation agreements with other banks on commercial loans in order to spread credit risk and manage customer expectations. In these circumstances, the Bank will generally follow its customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had $62.7 million in loan participations bought where another bank was the lead lender. Conversely, the Bank had $5.3 million related to loan participations sold where the Bank acted as the lead lender and serviced the loan relationship.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Bank’s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, the Bank reviews the borrower’s employment and credit history, and historical and projected income and expenses. The Bank requires “full documentation” on all loan applications. The Bank requires a full appraisal of all real property securing 1st lien residential mortgage loans. The Bank also requires appraisals on home equity loans and lines of credit for loans greater than $250,000 and commercial real estate loans greater than $500,000. For loan amounts under these thresholds, an appraisal may be required or other objective methods of property valuations are utilized. All appraisers are state-licensed or state-certified appraisers, and it is Bank practice to have local appraisers approved by the Board of Directors annually.
The Bank’s policies and loan approval limits are established by the Board of Directors. The approval authority necessary to decision all loan applications regardless of loan type is based on the resulting total exposure of the relationship. Secured loan requests with a relationship exposure of $3.0 million or less can be approved by designated individual officers, officers acting together with specific lending approval authority, and/or the Officer Loan Committee. Secured loan requests with a relationship exposure in excess of $3.0 million can be approved by the Board Loan Committee. Unsecured loan requests utilize a similar authority breakdown with the Board Loan Committee decisioning transaction for relationships with unsecured exposures in excess of $750,000. The Board of Directors approves all loan requests subject to Regulation O, and those that result in a relationship exposure that exceeds the Bank’s internal House Limit. The Bank’s House Limit was $8.9 million at December 31, 2020.
Investments
The Bank’s Investment Committee, which is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Director of Finance and Investment Specialist, has primary responsibility for implementing the 

7



Bank’s Investment Policy, which is established by the Bank’s Audit Committee. The general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the Investment Committee in consultation with the Audit Committee. The Investment Committee is responsible for the execution of specific investment actions. These officers are authorized to execute investment transactions without the Audit Committee’s prior approval (provided the transactions are within the scope of the established Investment Policy). The Investment Policy is reviewed annually by the Investment Committee, and any changes to the policy are subject to approval by the Audit Committee. The overall objectives of the Investment Policy are to maintain a portfolio of high quality and diversified investments to maximize interest income over the long term and to minimize risk, to provide collateral for borrowings, to provide additional earnings when loan production is low, and, when appropriate, to reduce the Bank’s tax liability. The policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of principal, liquidity requirements and interest rate risk management. All securities transactions are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.
The Bank’s current Investment Policy permits investments in securities issued by the U.S. government as well as mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities, corporate bonds and direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. The Investment Policy also permits, with certain limitations, investments in certificates of deposit, collateralized mortgage obligations, mutual funds and equity securities. The Bank’s current Investment Policy does not permit investment in stripped mortgage-backed securities or derivatives as defined in federal banking regulations or in other high-risk securities. The Bank’s Investment Policy expressly prohibits the use of the investment portfolio for market-oriented trading activities or speculative purposes unless otherwise approved by the Audit Committee. The Bank does not currently have a trading account for investment securities.
The Company designates a security as either trading, held to maturity, or available for sale, based upon the Company’s ability and intent. Securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Held-to-maturity securities are debt securities acquired with the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are stated at amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are other debt and equity securities that are not classified as trading or held-to-maturity securities and serve principally as a source of liquidity. Available-for-sale debt securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax, until realized. Available-for-sale equity securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as equity fair value adjustments in the income statement.
A periodic review and evaluation of the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other-than-temporary. At December 31, 2020, all of the Company’s securities were classified as available for sale. The Company’s securities portfolio at December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of securities with the following fair values: $95.5 million of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; $80.7 million of municipal obligations; $4.0 million of U.S. government and agency obligations; $5.2 million of corporate bonds and $2.6 million of equity securities. At December 31, 2020, none of the collateral underlying the Company’s securities portfolio was considered subprime or Alt-A. See “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Balance Sheet Analysis: December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 — Investment Securities Portfolio” for a discussion of the recent performance of the Company’s securities portfolio.
Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities are typically collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily (loans on properties with 5 or more units) mortgages, although the Bank invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as the Bank. The interest rate on the security is lower than the interest rates on the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. Ginnie Mae, a U.S. government agency, and government sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize borrowings and public deposits. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual 

8



payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
Sources of Funds
General. Deposits traditionally have been the primary source of funds for investment and lending activities. The Bank also borrows from the FHLB to supplement cash flow needs. Additional sources of funds include scheduled loan payments, maturing investments, loan repayments, customer repurchase agreements, income on other earning assets and the proceeds of loan sales.
Deposits. Deposits are accepted primarily from the areas in which the Bank’s offices are located. The Bank relies on competitive pricing and products, convenient locations and quality customer service to attract and retain deposits. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. The Bank’s deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, certificates of deposit and checking accounts. Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements and the Bank’s deposit growth goals.
Borrowings. Borrowings consist of short-term borrowings and long term advances from the FHLB, funds borrowed from customers under repurchase agreements, and financing lease liabilities. At December 31, 2020, there were no FHLB short-term borrowings and long-term advances totaled $86.4 million, or 9.5%, of total liabilities. Repurchase agreements totaled $3.6 million, or 0.4%, of total liabilities. Financing lease liabilities totaled $3.0 million, or 0.3%, of total liabilities at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had access to additional FHLB borrowings of up to $315.2 million. Short-term borrowings and long-term advances from the FHLB are collateralized by certain qualifying collateral such as loans, with weighted average collateral values determined by the FHLB equal to at least the unpaid amount of outstanding borrowings. Repurchase agreements are secured by municipal and U.S. government obligations.
Subsidiary Activities
The Bank has one active subsidiary, Westmoreland Investment Company, which is a Delaware corporation that holds residential mortgage loans originated and serviced by the Bank.
Expense and Tax Allocation
The Bank has entered into an agreement with the Company to provide it with certain administrative support services, whereby the Bank will be compensated at not less than the fair market value of the services provided. In addition, the Bank and the Company have entered into an agreement to establish a method for allocating and for reimbursing the payment of their consolidated tax liability.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had 141 full time and 11 part time employees. The Bank’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. The success of our business is highly dependent on our employees, who provide value through their dedication to our mission of establishing and maintaining mutually beneficial long-term relationships with customers, businesses, professionals and the communities we serve. Management believes they have a good working relationship with their employees. Our workplace culture is grounded in a set of core values – a concern for others, trust, respect, hard work, and a dedication to our customers and communities. We seek to hire well-qualified employees who are also a good fit for our value system. Our selection and promotion processes are without bias. 
We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual training and career development is advanced through regular performance discussions between employees and their managers, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs. Reimbursement is 

9



available to employees enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to our business, and for seminars, conferences, and other training events employees attend in connection with their job duties.
​
The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. While the Company’s banking operations were not restricted by the government stay-at-home orders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took steps to protect its employees and customers by providing for remote working for many employees, enhancing cleaning procedures for the Company’s offices, requiring face masks to be worn by employees and maintaining appropriate social distancing in our offices. The Company continues to assess and monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and will take additional such steps as are necessary to protect its employees and assist its customers during this difficult time.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
The Bank is supervised and examined by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposits and its primary federal regulator. The Bank is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. The Bank is also subject to consumer protection rules and regulations issued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau although, because it has less than $10.0 billion in total consolidated assets, the FDIC and Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities are responsible for examining and supervising the Bank’s compliance with these laws. This system of state and federal regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund, depositors, and other customers, and not for the protection of security holders. The Bank is periodically examined by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC to ensure that it satisfies applicable standards with respect to its capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. Following examinations, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC prepare reports for the consideration of the Bank’s Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors is also regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of the Bank’s loan documents.
As a bank holding company, the Company. is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Board.
Any change in the applicable laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations.
Set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Company. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company.
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on the Bank’s operations and the cost of operations.” Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act required various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over a period of years. Although the effect of all of these regulations cannot be completely determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations will continue to increase the Bank’s operating and compliance costs.

10



On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintained most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amended certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10.0 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50.0 billion.
Banking Regulation
Pennsylvania Savings Bank Law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the “Banking Code”), contains detailed provisions governing the organization, operations, corporate powers, savings and investment authority, branching rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees of Pennsylvania savings banks. Under the Banking Code, a Pennsylvania savings bank may operate its banking business out of its principal office and may establish and maintain branch offices anywhere in Pennsylvania, or in other states, with the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities in its supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any trustee, officer, attorney, or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities why such person should not be removed. The Department of Banking and Securities may also appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution in appropriate cases.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015, and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital generally is defined as common equity Tier 1 plus additional Tier 1 capital, such as certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and certain other items. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when deemed necessary.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in and became fully effective on December 31, 2020.
As a result of the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies have adopted a rule to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion that meet other specified criteria a “community bank leverage ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets). Institutions may elect to utilize the community bank leverage ratio in lieu of the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements noted above. The federal banking agencies adopted 9% as the 

11



applicable ratio, however, in response to federal legislation dealing with the effects of COVID-19, the ratio was temporarily reduced to 8% effective March 31, 2020. The agencies established a community bank leverage ratio of 8.5% for calendar 2021 and the ratio will revert to 9% effective January 1, 2022. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirements and electing to follow the alternative framework are considered compliant with all applicable regulatory capital and leverage requirements, including the requirement to be “well-capitalized” for purposes of prompt corrective action, discussed below. The Bank did not utilize the community bank leverage ratio frame work in its December 31, 2020 Call Report and maintains the right to opt-in or opt-out of the framework in any subsequent quarter. 
The Bank is also subject to capital guidelines of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities requires 4.0% leverage capital and incorporates the federal risk-based requirements. The components of capital are substantially the same as those defined by the FDIC. At December 31, 2020, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
Prompt Corrective Action. Under federal regulations, as amended to incorporate the previously referenced revised capital requirements, a bank is considered to be (i) “well capitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8.0% or more, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of 6.5% or more and Tier 1 leverage capital of 5.0% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of 8.0% or more, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 6.0% or more, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of 4.5% or more and Tier 1 leverage capital of 4.0% or more and does not meet the definition of “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of less than 8.0%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of 4.5% or less or Tier 1 leverage capital of less than 4.0%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, Tier 1 risk-based capital less than 4.0% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital of less than 3.0, or Tier 1 leverage capital of less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if its ratio of tangible equity to total assets is equal to or less than 2.0%. Federal regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well-capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was “well-capitalized” for this purpose and exceeded all applicable capital requirements.
Federal law provides for certain supervisory measures for undercapitalized institutions including restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth and the requirement that a capital restoration plan be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date an institution receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the institution will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the institution. Any holding company for an institution required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the FDIC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Generally, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames.
Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitation. Under applicable regulations, with certain limited exceptions, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank may lend to a single or related group of borrowers on an “unsecured” basis an amount equal to 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. As a prudent lending practice, however, Management and the Board of Directors have established an internal limitation for approval purposes based on the total exposure of a relationship. The formula to determine the Bank’s internal limitation is Tangible Capital times 15% times 50%. This 

12



limitation is a rolling number based on the Bank’s capital balance, and is measured at the end of each calendar quarter. The internal limitation as of December 31, 2020 was $8.9 million. Any new loan request that results in an exposure for approval purposes that exceeds this limitation must be presented to the full Board of Directors for decisioning.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Federal law generally limits the types and amounts of equity investments of state-chartered banks insured by the FDIC to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things: (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary that is engaged in permissible activities; (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets; (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures liability insurance for directors, trustees or officers, or blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution owned exclusively by other depository institutions if certain requirements are met. The direct or indirect activities of a state-chartered bank are similarly generally limited to those of a national bank. Exceptions include where approval is received for the activity from the FDIC.
Capital Distributions. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Bank is also subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Banking Code. The Banking Code states, among other things, that dividends may be declared and paid by the Bank only out of accumulated net earnings.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if such institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low-and moderate-income areas) which they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches. The Bank has a current CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”
Transactions with Related Parties. Transactions between banks and their related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank.
Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to non-affiliates. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of a loan to, purchase of assets from, issuance of a guarantee on behalf of and similar transactions with an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate must be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws, assuming such loans are also permitted under the law of the institution’s chartering state. Under such laws, the Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities under such person’s control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank’s capital position and requires certain board of directors, approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially 

13



the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are further limited to specific categories.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions with less than $10.0 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years. That system, effective July 1, 2016, replaced the previous system under which institutions were placed into risk categories.
The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund’s reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10.0 billion of total assets to a range of 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, effective July 1, 2016.
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC was required to seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act required insured institutions with assets of $10.0 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions were subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that the 1.35% ratio had been achieved. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets began receiving credits to the extent that their assessment payments contributed to raising the ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The FDIC announced that such credits were fully remitted by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC; the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term fund ratio of 2.0%.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of by the Bank. Future insurance assessments cannot be predicted.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank does not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of its deposit insurance.
Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including the Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and 

14



desist orders and capital directives and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
Other Regulations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions.
Bank Holding Company Regulations. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). The BHC Act requires each bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank, or before it may acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of the voting shares of such bank. Such a transaction may also require approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.
Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, the Company may only engage in or own companies that engage in activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The holding company must obtain permission from the Federal Reserve Board prior to engaging in most new business activities. A bank holding company that meets certain criteria may become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader range of financial activities, including insurance underwriting and investment banking. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company.
The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to revise its holding company consolidated capital requirements so that they are no less stringent than those applicable to insured depository institutions. The previously referenced regulatory capital requirements applicable to banks also apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $3.0 billion or more. Such capital requirements would apply to the Company at such time as its size met that threshold.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Federal Reserve Board policies require a bank holding company to consult with and receive the nonobjection of the agency prior to paying dividends or repurchasing its stock under certain circumstances. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory requirements and policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Change in Control Regulations. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal 

15



regulations, means ownership, control of or holding more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances, including where the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company (as “control” is defined in the BHCA Act) without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
Federal Securities Laws
The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is subject to the information and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The Company’s common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that the Company’s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)
The CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provided over $2 trillion to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) and stimulate the economy. The law had several provisions relevant to depository institutions, including:
Allowing institutions not to characterize loan modifications relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as troubled debt restructurings and also allowing them to suspend the corresponding impairment determination for accounting purposes; 
As previously noted, temporarily reducing to 8% the community bank leverage ratio alternative available to institutions with less than $10 billion of assets.
The ability of a borrower of a federally-backed mortgage loan (VA, FHA, USDA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae) experiencing financial hardship due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 pandemic, to request forbearance from paying their mortgage by submitting a request to the borrower’s servicer affirming their financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. Such a forbearance could be granted for up to 180 days, subject to extension for an additional 180-day period upon the request of the borrower. During that time, no fees, penalties or interest beyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the borrower made all contractual payments on time and in full under the mortgage contract could accrue on the borrower’s account. Except for vacant or abandoned property, the servicer of a federally-backed mortgage was prohibited from taking any foreclosure action, including any eviction or sale action, for not less than the 

16



60-day period beginning March 18, 2020. The Biden Administration has indicated its intent that the federal mortgage backing agencies will extent the forbearance program and the foreclosure moratorium to at least June 30, 2021.
The ability of a borrower of a multi-family federally backed mortgage loan that was current as of February 1, 2020, to submit a request for forbearance to the borrower’s servicer affirming that the borrower is experiencing financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency. A forbearance would be granted for up to 30 days, which could be extended for up to two additional 30-day periods upon the request of the borrower. Later extensions were made available, for a total of six months, for certain federally backed multi-family mortgage loans. During the time of the forbearance, the multi-family borrower could not evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant or charge any late fees, penalties or other charges to a tenant for late payment of rent. Additionally, a multi-family borrower that received a forbearance could not require a tenant to vacate a dwelling unit before a date that is 30 days after the date on which the borrower provided the tenant notice to vacate and may not issue a notice to vacate until after the expiration of the forbearance.
The Paycheck Protection Program
The CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act provided $659 billion to fund loans by depository institutions to eligible small businesses through the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) 7(a) loan guaranty program. These loans are 100% federally guaranteed (principal and interest). An eligible business could apply under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) during the applicable covered period and receive a loan up to 2.5 times its average monthly “payroll costs” limited to a loan amount of $10.0 million. The proceeds of the loan could be used for payroll (excluding individual employee compensation over $100,000 per year), mortgage, interest, rent, insurance, utilities and other qualifying expenses. PPP loans have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0%, (b) a two-year loan term (or five-year loan term for loans made after June 5, 2020) to maturity; and (c) principal and interest payments deferred until the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the borrower’s lender or, alternatively, notifies the lender no loan forgiveness is allowed. If the borrower did not submit a loan forgiveness application to the lender within 10 months following the end of the 24-week loan forgiveness covered period (or the 8-week loan forgiveness covered period with respect to loans made prior to June 5, 2020 if such covered period is elected by the borrower), the borrower would begin paying principal and interest on the PPP loan immediately after the 10-month period. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be fully reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as, during the applicable loan forgiveness covered period, employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60% of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. Through December 31, 2020 the Company had processed over 400 PPP loan applications totaling over $43.2 million.
On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “Relief Act”) became law and provides an additional $284 billion for the PPP, and extended the PPP through at least March 31, 2021. PPP changes as a result of the Relief Act included: (1) an opportunity for a second PPP forgivable loan for small businesses and nonprofits with 300 or fewer employees that can demonstrate a loss of 25 percent of gross receipts in any quarter during 2020 compared to the same quarter in 2019; (2) allowing qualified borrowers to apply for a PPP loan up to 2.5 times (or 3.5 times for small businesses in the restaurant and hospitality industries) the borrower’s average monthly payroll costs in the one-year period prior to the date on which the loan is made or calendar year 2019, limited to a loan amount of $2.0 million; (3) the addition of personal protective equipment expenses, costs associated with outdoor dining, uninsured costs related to property damaged and vandalism or looting due to 2020 public disturbances and supplier costs as eligible and forgivable expenses; (4) simplifying the loan forgiveness process for loans of $150,000 or less; and (5) eliminating the requirement that Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Advances will reduce the borrower’s PPP loan forgiveness amount. Additionally, expenses paid with the proceeds of PPP loans that are forgiven became tax-deductible, reversing previous guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, which did not allow deductions on expenses paid for with PPP loan proceeds.

TAXATION
Federal Taxation
General. The Company and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and the Bank.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Bank will file a consolidated tax return with the Company and will report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a calendar year ending December 31st for filing their consolidated federal income tax returns.
Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no net operating loss carryovers for federal income tax purposes.
Corporate Dividends. The Company will be able to exclude from income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
Audit of Tax Returns. The 2014 federal tax return was audited by the Internal Revenue Service in 2016 with no changes to the return as filed. There are no audits of any open tax years currently underway.
State Taxation
The Bank is subject to the Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia Corporate Net Income tax which is allocated between the states and calculated at 11.50%, 8.25% and 6.50%, respectively, based on taxable income applicable to the individual states. The Company’s state income tax returns, as applicable, have not been audited in the most recent five year period.
