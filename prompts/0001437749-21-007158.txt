ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a medical device company predominantly focused on eye care. A majority of our revenue comes from Avenova®, an FDA cleared product sold in the United States that has proven in laboratory testing to have broad antimicrobial properties as it removes foreign material including microorganisms and debris from skin around the eye, including the eyelid. Avenova is formulated with our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid. Avenova is available directly to consumers through our on-line sales channel and is also often prescribed and dispensed by eyecare professionals for blepharitis and dry-eye disease.
 
We continue to promote Avenova through all four of our primary distribution channels: (1) our direct-to-consumer model, allowing customers to order online and forego time-consuming doctor visits and trips to the pharmacy; (2) retail pharmacies, selling to consumers through local pharmacies across 50 states; (3) our Partner Pharmacy Program, providing a consistent patient experience at contracted pricing; and (4) our physician dispensed channel, allowing patients to buy Avenova during office visits to their preferred eye care specialist. We achieved record overall Avenova unit sales in 2020 despite the global COVID-19 pandemic and general economic conditions that challenged many businesses throughout 2020. 
 
Late in 2020, we also launched a rebranded CelleRx® into the beauty industry as CelleRx® Clinical Reset™. Prior to this rebranding, our marketing of CelleRx focused on medical professionals only.
 
Beyond Avenova and CelleRx, we have developed additional products containing our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid, including NeutroPhase® and PhaseOne® for the wound care market.
 
In addition to our proprietary products, we responded to the national need for protective personal equipment (PPE) in the first half of 2020 by tapping into our international supply network and launching the sale of KN95 Masks and other PPE. Although sales from the KN95 Masks were significant in the second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant decrease in PPE sales in the third and fourth quarters as supply shortages narrowed, prices declined and distribution competition increased. As we have returned our focus to our core business in eyecare, we do not currently anticipate dedicating significant future Company resources toward the sale of PPE and we do not expect significant future revenue from PPE sales.
 
Avenova
 
Avenova is a proprietary solution of hypochlorous acid that acts as an antimicrobial preservative in solution and has been shown to neutralize bacterial toxins in laboratory tests. Because it is a gentle isotonic solution, it is well suited for daily use. Avenova offers distinct advantages when compared to alternative lid and lash regimens that contain soaps, bleach, and other impurities, as Avenova removes unwanted microorganisms from the skin without the use of those harmful ingredients. Avenova’s target market is the millions of Americans who suffer from minor irritation of the skin around the eye (commonly referred to as blepharitis) as well as anyone who suffers from dry eye (commonly described as a gritty sandy sensation while blinking). We began selling prescription Avenova in the United States in 2014.
 
In the second quarter of 2019, we began selling Avenova online as an over-the-counter product. By creating a product that does not require a doctor’s prescription, we made Avenova available to many more potential customers and broadened our addressable market. This direct-to-consumer version of Avenova also capitalizes on a trend to sell pharmaceutical products directly to consumers in response to increased cost shifting to consumers through high-deductible health plans and adds convenience by allowing customers to forego a time-consuming doctor visit and trip to the pharmacy.

The launch of over-the-counter Avenova proved to be especially fortuitous during the COVID-19 pandemic as it allowed consumers to order Avenova on-line without a prescription and without leaving their homes.
 
Over-the-counter Avenova is now our leading product by unit sales and net revenue despite having a lower average net selling price than prescription Avenova. This sales performance reflects our ongoing focus and increasing spend on digital marketing and public relations initiatives. Avenova is now available on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and Avenova.com. Late in 2020, we also began working with CVS, one of the nation’s largest retail chains to make Avenova available at CVS store locations throughout the U.S. and on CVS.com beginning in the first quarter of 2021.
 
Despite the shift to a direct-to-consumer model, support from ophthalmologists and optometrists remains strong. The continual endorsement of medical professionals has created a “doctor recommended” halo effect around our brand. This is a key differentiating factor in a crowded consumer space and is a result of our high quality and reliable efficacy. Our physician dispensed channel is particularly important in this regard as patients are able to purchase Avenova conveniently and immediately upon recommendation in the doctor’s office. We believe this also creates repeat Avenova customers who subsequently purchase Avenova through other channels.
 
We also make prescription Avenova accessible nationwide in nearly all retail pharmacies across the United States through agreements with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen Corporation. We also have agreements directly with some preferred pharmacy networks through our Partner Pharmacy Program. These agreements provide greater control over the patient experience at consistent contract pricing.
 
We continue to build our prescription business under a value pricing model. We maintain a rebate program for electronic payment transactions and in the form of instant rebate cards. The rebate cards are intended to be used by patients who either do not have insurance coverage or whose insurance coverage does not cover Avenova, thereby lowering the price for the patient at the pharmacy. Our partner pharmacies ensure that proper insurance reimbursement occurs, and that our patients are receiving the best possible price.
 
Competitors for Avenova 
 
There are many companies that sell lid and lash scrubs, most of which, to the best of our knowledge, are surfactant (soap) based. Unlike these detergent based products, Avenova consists solely of saline and 0.01% pure hypochlorous acid, without the toxic impurities included in competitive offerings. While there are some hypochlorous acid based products on the market, they all include bleach or other dangerous impurities. Because Avenova lacks these impurities, we believe that physicians and their patients will continue to choose Avenova over other competitive products. While cheaper antibacterial soaps are commonly used to reduce or prevent bacterial contamination on the skin, we do not view them as true competitors of Avenova.
CelleRx Clinical Reset (Dermatology) 
 
CelleRx Clinical Reset is a gentle and soothing facial spray that disrupts the layer of bacteria that settles and grows on the face.  When this barrier is out of balance, acne, rosacea and infection can set in.  As the brand name suggests, Clinical Reset gets the skin back to a healthy baseline to heal itself while also enabling absorption of other skincare products.  It is formulated with our patented, pure, prescription-grade hypochlorous acid and can replace or augment a morning cleanse for dry sensitive skin, reduce bacteria after exercising, calm skin following microdermabrasion and other aesthetic facial procedures and combat environmental aggressors. Unlike many harsh products used for the same purpose, it is gentle and is not an antibiotic.
 
We are leveraging new consumer focused messaging and the product’s pharmaceutical pedigree in robust social media and print advertising campaigns marketing CelleRx Clinical Reset in the beauty industry.
 
NeutroPhase and PhaseOne (Wound Care)
 
Consisting of higher concentrations of hypochlorous acid, NeutroPhase and PhaseOne are used for the cleansing and irrigation of intraoperative pocket lavage, before subcutaneous closure, stage I to IV pressure injuries, stasis ulcers, leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, first-degree and second-degree burns, post-surgical wounds, grafted and donor sites, minor burns, superficial abrasions, wounds, and moistening absorbent wound dressings.
 
Both NeutroPhase and PhaseOne compete in a crowded wound cleanser market with many older and lower-priced products with similar uses, such as Vashe and Betadine Surgical Scrub. However, we believe our solution has distinct competitive advantages because it is made without the toxic bleach and other preservative chemicals found in other products, making it gentle, non-irritating, and non-sensitizing to skin and new tissue. PhaseOne is distributed through commercial partners in the United States and NeutroPhase is distributed in China by Pioneer Pharma.

Customers, Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Avenova is available on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, and Avenova.com. Online sales accounted for 56% of all Avenova revenue and 57% of all Avenova units sold across all channels in 2020.
 
Historically, we have called on ophthalmologists, optometrists, and other eye care professionals who can prescribe Avenova. With thousands of doctors prescribing and selling the product, no individual doctor represented in excess of 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 
CelleRx is distributed to customers primarily through online channels, while NeutroPhase and PhaseOne rely on distribution partners.
 
We currently outsource manufacturing of all our products to two contract manufacturers with facilities located in the United States. We believe our contract manufacturers have adequate manufacturing capacity to satisfy our demands and additional contract manufacturers are also available should they be required.
 
All raw materials and other supplies utilized in the manufacturing process of our contract manufacturers are available from various third-party suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by a variety of means, including obtaining patents, maintaining trade secrets and proprietary know-how and technological innovation to operate, without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. In order to maintain our trade secrets, we have entered into confidentiality/invention rights agreements with all our employees and confidentiality agreements with our contract manufacturers.
Research and Development
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Pursuant to our business strategy of focusing our resources on growing the commercial sales of Avenova, and increasingly on our recently rebranded CelleRx Clinical Reset, we are currently not conducting any substantive research and development. Any substantial research and development costs incurred in the future would likely be related to our urology program, which we do not expect to move forward in the near-term.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to extensive government regulation, principally by the FDA and state and local authorities in the United States and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. Governmental authorities in the United States extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, research, development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical and medical device products under various federal laws including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and under comparable laws by the states in the United States and in most foreign countries. We also hold our CE Mark and ISO 13485 certifications. To maintain these certifications, we undergo significant quality control audits with the relevant European authorities every year.

FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must receive FDA 510(k) clearance. We believe we have obtained the required FDA clearance for all of our current products that require such clearance.
 
The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (“PMA”). PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III medical devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA process is based on statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification ("PMN") requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The PMN must demonstrate that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device, which is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.
 
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA's general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the “General Controls”, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) PMN process described below. Avenova is classified as a Class I medical device.
 
None of our products are Class II or Class III medical devices.
 
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 
A host of regulatory requirements apply to our marketed devices, including the quality system regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), the Medical Reporting Regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products), labeling regulations, and the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or "off-label" uses. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new cGMP requirements could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Health Care Fraud and Abuse
 
In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law (42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(b)) prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid). Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued regulations, known as the safe harbors, which identify permissible practices. If all of the requirements of an applicable safe harbor are met, an arrangement will not be prosecuted under this law. Safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business, including, among other things, payments to bona fide employees, certain discount arrangements, and certain payment arrangements involving GPOs. The failure of an arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. However, conduct that does not fully satisfy each requirement of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG or the Department of Justice. Violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products. In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Law, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these state laws closely follow the language of the federal law. Some state anti-kickback laws apply regardless of whether a federal health care program payment is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and relationships with health care providers or pharmacies by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with them.
 
Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §3729 et seq.) imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program (including Medicaid and Medicare). Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims. A number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, and imprisonment.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created certain criminal statutes relating to health care, including health care fraud and false statements related to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits, among others, knowingly and willingly executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to monitor and report certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for disclosure to the public. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing, medical directorships, and other purposes. Some states mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, and some states limit or prohibit such gifts.
 
Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians. Our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are open to a variety of interpretations. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.

Third-Party Reimbursement
 
Customers who are prescribed our product generally rely on third-party payors, such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of our product. As a result, demand for our product is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors.
 
Private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that private third-party payors will cover and reimburse our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. Notably, in 2019, we received notices from several national third-party payors that they would not cover Avenova. Currently, none of our products are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and we do not anticipate they will be reimbursed by such programs in the future.
 
CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, frequently changes product descriptors, coverage policies, product and service codes, payment methodologies and reimbursement values. Private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that private third-party payors will cover and reimburse our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. Further, in the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, federal and state proposals to lower expenditures for medical products and services, which may adversely affect reimbursement for our products. 
 
Other U.S. Regulation
 
We must also comply with numerous federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, healthcare reform, patient privacy and information, fire hazard control and, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 25 employees, 22 of whom were full-time employees and 3 were part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities
 
Our principal executive office and administrative operations are located in Emeryville, California. On August 24, 2016, we entered into an Office Lease (the “Lease”), pursuant to which we leased approximately 7,799 rentable square feet of real property located on the eleventh floor (Suite 1150) at 2000 Powell Street, Emeryville, California 94608 from KBSIII Towers at Emeryville, LLC (the “Landlord”), for our principal executive offices. The expiration date of the Lease is February 28, 2022, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions of the Lease. The Company has the option to extend the term of the Lease for one five (5)-year period upon written notice to the Landlord due no earlier than twelve (12) months and no later than nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the Lease. We believe that our office and administration facilities are suitable and adequate for our current operations, but we may require additional space and facilities as our business expands. The Company intends to renew the lease upon expiration.
