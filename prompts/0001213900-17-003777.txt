Item 1. Business
 
General Background and Description of the Company 
 
My Size Inc. (hereinafter: the “Company”) was incorporated and commenced operations in September 1999 as Topspin Medical, Inc., (“Topspin”), a private company registered in the State of Delaware. Topspin was engaged, through 2012, in research and development of a medical magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) technology for interventional cardiology and in the development of MRI technology for use in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.
 
On September 1, 2005, the Company issued securities to the public in Israel according to a prospectus and became publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”). In 2007, and until August 2012, the Company registered some of its securities with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
In January 2012, after having received the approval at the general meeting of shareholders of the company, the company consummated a transaction whereby it acquired Metamorefix Ltd. Pursuant to such transaction Metamorefix became wholly owned by the Company. Metamorefix Ltd. was incorporated in 2007, and was engaged in the development of innovative solutions for the rehabilitation of tissues, particularly skin tissues. 
 
On August 21, 2012, the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), approved the suspension of the Company’s reporting obligations under Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act (the “De-Registration”). The Company thereafter filed a Form 15 with the SEC on September 5, 2012 to effect the De-Registration. Upon the filing of the Form 15, the Company’s obligation to file periodic and current reports with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, was immediately suspended.
 
By the end of 2012, in view of the Company’s cash flow, the Company’s ceased its above operations and shortly thereafter the Company’s employees were laid off. In January 2013 the Company sold its entire ownership interest in Metamorefix Ltd..
 
In December 2013, the Company changed its name to Knowledgetree Ventures Inc. In January, 2014, the Board approved a transaction with Shoshana Zigdon, a related party, concerning the entering into of a technology venture through a new subsidiary, as discussed in “Shoshana Zigdon Agreement” below. On February 16, 2014, the Company changed its name to My Size, Inc.
 
On July 25, 2016, the Company’s common stock began publicly trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”).
 
Transaction Involving Change in Control
 
In September 2013, Ronen Luzon, the Company’s current Chief Executive Officer, purchased control of the Company from Mr. Asher Shmuelevitch (the "Transaction"). Mr. Luzon purchased 1,755,950 shares from Mr. Shmuelevitch, which shares represented approximately 40% of the issued and outstanding share capital at such time, and thus he became a controlling shareholder of the Company.
 
Within the framework of the Transaction, Mr. Luzon reached a settlement with the Company's creditors pursuant to which the main creditor, Mr. Asher Shmuelevitch, was paid a total sum of New Israeli Shekel (“NIS”) 0.5 million, in consideration for a full and final waiver of any and all his claims that he may have relating to any monetary indebtedness of the Company to the creditors.
 
As a result of the various investment rounds in the Company, Mr. Luzon's holdings in the Company have been diluted and currently represent approximately 9.97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.

Business Overview
 
The Company is a technology company whose strategy is based on the development of applications that can be utilized to accurately take measurements of a variety of items via a smartphone. By downloading the application to one’s smartphone, the user is then able to run the smartphone over the surface of an item the user wishes to measure. The information is then automatically sent to a cloud-based server where the dimensions are calculated through the company’s proprietary algorithms, and the accurate measurements (+ or - .78 of an inch) are then sent back to the users smartphone. We believe that the commercial applications for this technology are significant in many areas.
 
Currently, we are focusing on the following market segments:
 

● | E-commerce Apparel Industry – our main target-market; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Courier Services; 
--+----------------------


● | Do It Yourself (DIY) uses; and 
--+-----------------------------------


● | Usage as a Tape Measure. 
--+-----------------------------

 
While we are currently devoting much of our focus on the applications for the apparel business, the Company believes that all of the above mentioned applications will be useful to users, retailers and vendors alike.

February 2014 Purchase Agreement
 
In February 2014, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement’) with Shoshana Zigdon (“Seller”), relating to the acquisition of certain rights in a venture for the accumulation of physical data of human beings by portable electronic devices (including smart phones, tablets and other portable devices) for the purpose of locating, based on the accumulated data, articles of clothing in internet apparel stores, which will fit the person whose measurements were so accumulated (the “Venture”). Prior to entering into the Agreement, in January 2014, the Agreement was approved by shareholders of the Company as the Seller was also a beneficial owner of over 20% of the Company.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company purchased the all of Seller’s rights, title and interest in and to the Venture, including but not limited to, the method (the “Method”) and the certain patent application that had been filed by Seller (PCT/IL2013/050056) (the “Patent”, and collectively with the Method, the “Assets”).
 
In consideration for the sale of the Assets, the Company agreed to pay to Seller, 18% of the Company's operating profit, directly or indirectly connected with the Venture and/or the Method and/or the commercialization of the Patent together with Value-added tax (“VAT”) in accordance with the law (the "Consideration") for a period of 7 years from the end of the development period of the Venture. The parties further agreed that Seller’s right to receive the Consideration will apply even in the event the Patent is revoked/rejected/expires and/or the non-receipt of the Patent for any reason. Down payments on account of the Consideration are to be paid to the Seller once quarterly, within 14 days from the approval of the reviewed financial reports of the Company, with the exception of the fourth quarter which will be paid after the approval of the audited financial reports of the Company. Payment will be made against a duly issued tax invoice as prescribed by law.
 
The Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a breach of the obligations of the other party and the failure to cure a default within a specified period of time. The Agreement further provides that Seller is entitled to repurchase the Assets from the Company upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events: (a) if an application for liquidation of the Company and/or an application for Appointment of a receiver for the Company and/or for a significant part of its assets has been filed, and/or an attachment has been imposed on a significant part of the Company's assets, and the application or attachment – as the case may be – has not been not canceled within 60 (sixty) days from the date on which they are filed; or (b) if upon the date that is 7 years from the date of execution of the Agreement, the amount of Company’s income, directly and/or indirectly accumulated from the Venture and/or the Method and/or the commercialization of the Patent is less than NIS 3.6 million (“Repurchase Events”).
 
In any such Repurchase Event occurs, Seller’s shall have a 90 day right, subject to delivery of written notice to the Company of Seller’s intention to exercise such right, to repurchase the Assets from the Company. The repurchase price will be based upon a market price to be determined by an external and independent valuer, who shall be chosen by agreement by the parties, and the audit committee shall conduct the negotiations on behalf of the Company to determine the identity of the valuer. In the absence of agreement on the identity of the valuer, the valuer shall be appointed by the president of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Israel. If one of the parties appeals against the valuation, with the Company's decision to appeal being made by the audit committee of the company, the parties shall approach another agreed valuer from one of the four large accounting firms in Israel (and in the absence of agreement he shall be chosen by the president of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants) and an average shall be taken of the two valuations which are received. The parties shall bear the valuers' fees and all the expenses of the valuation in equal shares. Unless Seller gives the Company written notice of the retraction of Seller’s intention to repurchase the Assets, the Seller shall be obligated to repurchase the Assets within 60 days from the date of receipt of the valuation. Seller shall have the right to retract its intention to repurchase the assets, provided Seller gives written notice to the Company within 30 days of receiving the valuation and subject to Seller refunding the Company the expenses borne by the Company in respect of the valuation (provided that the Company gives Seller details of the expenses borne by it).
 
In addition to the foregoing, the Agreement provides that all developments, improvements knowledge and know-how developed and/or accumulated by the Company after the execution of the Agreement will be owned by the Company. Further, the Seller agreed not to compete, directly or indirectly, with the Company in anything relating to the Assets and/or the Venture and/or the Method for a period of 7 years from the end of the development period of the Venture.

The Market - The Apparel Industry
 
The growth in online apparel shopping has been both a blessing and a curse for retailers. The blessing: what was a $60 billion apparel and accessories market in 2015 is projected to increase to $86.4 billion US dollars by 2018. The curse: while online apparel shopping is growing quickly, so too have customer returns, and nearly 20-30% of the time it is because of a bad fit.
 
For apparel retailers, both in retail and online, customer returns are a necessary pain point, backed by flexible return policies and in some instances, free return shipping. However, online retailers have higher operating costs as at least 30% of all products ordered online are returned, compared to 8.89% from retail stores, according to recent data.  The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that total e-commerce sales for 2016 were $394.9 billion, an increase of 15.1% from 2015.  Digging deeper, it can be learned that most online apparel retailers have average return rates of 15-20%, of which around 80% are fit-based. When translating these figures into hard currency, in the United States, online consumers returned $260 billion in merchandise to retailers last year, or 8% of all purchases (according to the National Retail Federation).
 
MySizeID
 
We are currently in development of an application (“MySizeID”) which assists the consumer to accurately take the measurements of his or her own body using a smartphone in order to fit clothing in the best way possible without the need to try the clothes on. The purpose of our application is to simplify the process of clothing acquisition through the internet and to significantly reduce the rate of returns of ill-fitting clothing which are acquired through the internet.
 
The app. is the result of a research and development effort that combines:
 

● | Anthropometric research – analyses of information pertaining to body measurements derived from a survey and the subsequent determination of correlations between body parts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Body measurement algorithm research - an algorithm created by the Company to measure body parts. 
● | Retailers size chart analyses – adopting a deep understanding of the size charts of retailers and the corresponding "body to garment size". 

 
MySizeID will operate based on the use of existing sensors in smart phones which enable, through a specific purpose application, the measurement of the body of consumers independently by moving the cellular phone along his or her body. The measurements will then be saved on the Company's cloud database, enabling the user to search for clothes in various retailer websites without worrying about size. When a search is made, the retailer will connect to the Company's cloud database and then only provides results based on the user's measurements and other parameters as he or she may have defined. This data will also be saved for use when a customer enters a brick and mortar store to help serve the customer more efficiently and to better the shopping experience.
 
As soon as the item is found and the acquisition is completed, the retailer will be charged a certain percentage of the acquisition price. The rate to be charged by MySize for the acquisition has not yet been fixed, and will be determined following negotiations with fashion companies, in a more advanced stage of the development.
 
How MySizeID Can be Utilized by the Apparel Industry
 

1. | MySizeID: This app. will let consumers create a secure, online profile of their personal measurements, which can then be utilized with partnered online retailers to insure that no matter the manufacturer or size chart, they will get the right fit. The MySizeID app. will utilize a patent-pending measurement technology that does not rely on user photographs or any additional hardware; all a user needs to do is scan their body with their smartphone and the app records their measurements.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | In Store Shopping Tool: Users of MySizeID can allow brick and mortar merchants to access their profile to receive more personalized attention. This concierge like service enables a salesperson to better serve customers by accessing the user's size and style preferences to make the in-store shopping experience more pleasant, time efficient and satisfactory. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Cross Site Search Feature: The MySizeID profile will enable users to search for a specific product or item across multiple online retailers, but, unlike most shopping comparison shopping tools, MySizeID will deliver results that fit each individual user’s measurements. This feature can be customized for personalized filters that go beyond sizing and measurements, and can also include a user's favorite colors, brands, styles and more.

The application is being designed to use a person’s body measurements to help determine correct apparel sizes when shopping on-line. To begin, the app will measure the hip breadth, and uses statistical, mathematical algorithms to recommend the most appropriate size trousers.
 
True Size
 
In November 2016, My Size introduced a new product called TrueSize.
 
TrueSize is a customizable, white-label, mobile application that empowers retailers to improve the online shopping experience of their customers by perfectly matching their true measurements with the retailer’s offerings. The level of accuracy and ease of use integrated into the retailer's website ensures that the customers will select the right size apparel every time, and we believe this will significantly reduce the amount of returns.
How Does TrueSize Work?
 
TrueSize has two components: a white label app. and a small application located on each page of the retailer's website. First, the customer downloads the TrueSize app., branded to a specific retailer’s website, and signs in, using the same credentials used for the online store. The application will then guide the customer through the process.
 
Using the TrueSize app., the customer next takes accurate measurements of an item of clothing from their wardrobe by placing the smartphone first on one end of the item and then on the other end. The app. will then prompt the user to take several different measurements to get a complete reading. The information pertaining to each item is then saved, but can be updated at any time.
 
Measurements are next stored in the cloud and a recommended size for the user is calculated. The user may continue shopping directly from the app. by clicking the “Go Shopping“ button, which will direct them to the retailer's mobile website.
 
The chart below illustrates how consumers can interact with the prompts from the TrueSize app.

Shopping with TrueSize:
 
A “TrueSize” widget in the form of a button is located in proximity to the size selection feature on each product page of the retailer’s website. If the customer has signed in to the site and has already downloaded the TrueSize App and taken measurements, a recommended size will automatically appear in the widget. Users then have the option to manually update their size parameters – height, weight, and an item’s parameters – at any time by simply clicking on the widget.
 
If the customer has not yet signed, a prompt will appear requesting the customer to do so.
 
The first customer to use the TrueSize technology is IN SITU S.A., the owner of the rights to the fashion brand-name TRUCCO (the “Trucco Project”).
 
The Trucco Project is currently in the development stage and, and is being designed in conjunction with Trucco, so that Trucco customers can use it in the following manner:
 
Stage 1 – Trucco consumers will create their profile using our web service or through our mobile app by measuring garments out of their wardrobe.
 
Stage 2 – after creating their profile, the users will be able to log into Trucco online shop using their Trucco ID (received after creating their profile) and selecting the type of garment they would like to buy.
 
Stage 3 – Trucco servers will retrieve the user information from MySize servers and filter out only the items that match the users size.
 
Stage 4 – the users can then select the garments he or she like and proceed to checkout.

The launch of the Trucco Project is currently expected to take place in the second quarter of 2017. The Company’s success is currently substantially dependent upon the ongoing relationship with IN SITU S.A. and the achievement of the milestones for the Trucco project.
 
The Market - Courier Services
 
When an individual wishes to ship boxes from place to place, they often call a courier service. Currently, individuals will contact a courier service and request a pick up. The individual is then usually asked the dimensions of the package to be shipped. Unfortunately, the response given to the courier can be rather vague (big, medium small etc.). This is often the cause of much confusion between the individual shipper and the courier. This confusion can lead to the courier sending out the wrong vehicle for the pick-up and/or a large price differential than what was originally quoted by the courier causing customer dissatisfaction.
How MySize Can be Utilized for Courier Services
 
MySize operates based on the use of existing sensors in smart phones which enable, through a specific purpose application, to measure the dimensions of each package by moving the cellular phone along package (length, height and width) to be sent via courier. The measurements will then be saved on the Company's cloud database, and shared with the courier. This will allow for:

● | Courier services to provide accurate pricing to their consumers with little to no confusion. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Courier services can send the proper sized vehicle to pick up package(s). 

 
The courier service market in the United States alone had revenues of over $90 billion in 2014 (http:// marketrealist.com/2015/07/look-courier-service-industry-united-states/). Consequently, the Company views this as an excellent opportunity to create value in the courier market.
 
Agreement with Katz Delivery Services, LTD
 
On November 20, 2015, MySize entered into an agreement with Katz Deliveries, LTD (“Katz”), one of the largest courier services in Israel. Katz delivers about five million parcels per year (the most in Israel). Katz has more than 250 vehicles. Pursuant to our agreement with Katz, the parties have agreed to mutually work together to develop and integrate MySize technology with the technology of Katz to accurately monitor the volume of all parcels delivered to it for shipment by its clients. The goal is for Katz to use our technology to help with planning its distribution lines, thus reducing operational costs by adjusting the distribution vehicles to the volume of the shipments. MySize hopes to begin to see revenues from this endeavor by the second half of 2017, but is still in negotiations with Katz regarding terms of payment.
 
SizeUp
 
MySize is working on additional consumer applications. One of these applications is in the category of “Do It Yourself” (DIY). In this application, users will be able to visualize how an object or a piece of furniture will fit in an existing room in their home or office. As many people have difficulty with spatial recognition, the company hopes this will help alleviate the problem.
 
In the third quarter of 2015, My Size launched the SizeUp app, a smart tape measure for the Business to Consumer market. SizeUp is a project that MySize has already completed and launched. This application allows users to utilize their smartphone as a tape measurer. The application provides measurements with an accuracy +_- 2 cm. The SizeUp application is currently offered for free. In the first quarter of 2016, a 2nd version of SizeUp for the iOS operating system was released. It included the ability to measure both horizontal and vertical measurements. In January 2017, a 3rd version of SizeUp for the iOS operating system was released. It included an innovative air measurement algorithm which allows the user to measure over the air without the need to slide the phone over the surface during the measurement. Through February 2017, there have been over 200,000 downloads of the SizeUp app.
 
The first version of the SizeUp app for Android was released in March 2016. It included vertical measurement.
 
We expect to release an updated Android version by the third quarter of 2017 that will include also a very simple one-time calibration process for ensuring high accuracy.
 
Currently, the 3rd version of the SizeUp app. for iOS available for free. The Company’s plan, which has not been implemented, is for both versions of the SizeUp app (for Android and iOS) to be available for free for the first 30 days, where after a user will be required to pay to continue using it.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company has incurred research and development expenses of $727,000 in 2016 and $301,000 in 2015 relating to the development of its apps. and technologies. Most of the research and development expenses are for wages and for subcontractors. The Company expects to continue to incur these costs as continues to develop its products and technologies.

Income Sources - Projected Income
 
The Company business model currently contemplates four methods of producing revenue through its products:
 

1. | Fees - The Company intends to charge sellers a fee for every garment and clothing item purchased using its services, which fees are currently anticipated to be in the range of 1-3% of royalties on product sales, depending on volume, resulting from usage of the MySizeID platform. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Advertisements - the Company may generate revenue by using specialized ads using its database to identify the user's exact needs. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Second Hand Goods - the Company may offer its services for private sellers of garments and clothing, such as through "ebay" and the like. In this case, the seller will pay a fee if the purchase was made using the Company's application. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | "Offline Shopping" - the Company may offer its services for clothing and fashion stores, for real-time use by their customers. The service may allow the store to immediately offer the customer a fitting garment suitable for his or her size. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
MySize believes that its technology and applications are a win-win solution for consumers, retailers, couriers and individuals. The Company's technology is protected by 4 patent-pending submissions, with a fifth patent application in process. MySize's products are designed to allow users to measure themselves simply by sliding a smartphone over their body, and the measurements are recorded by the MySize app.
 
Unlike other products claiming similar capabilities, there is no need for additional accessories (no webcam, photos, or measuring tape etc.). Users of the MySize apps will have their information protected and a unique id number is provided that matches personal sizes with retailer size charts. When consumers get the right size products, retailers get fewer returns.
 
My Size's advantage lies in its easy to use application in recording body measurements. Using special algorithmic equations, the software is able to determine which sizes will best fit the customer. The collection of this data, and tracking shoppers' preferences, allows for a unique shopping experience both online and in brick and mortar stores where the technology can instantly match clothes the customer likes in sizes that will fit them.
 
However, My Size does face competition in helping retailers increase conversation rate and reduce shipping costs.

Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, and many of our competitors are well established in markets in which we have existing retailers or intend to locate new retailers. We may also need to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new retail formats or concepts that develop from time to time, and we cannot offer any assurance that we will be successful in doing so or that modifications to our concepts will not reduce our profitability.
 
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
We currently have 17 employees (some of which are independent contractors).
