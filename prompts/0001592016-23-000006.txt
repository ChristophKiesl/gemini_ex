ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”, “AgroFresh”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is an agriculture technology (AgTech) innovator and global leader whose mission is to prevent food loss and waste and conserve the planet’s resources by providing a range of science-based solutions, data-driven digital technologies and high-touch customer services. AgroFresh supports growers, packers and retailers with solutions across the food supply chain to enhance the quality and extend the shelf life of fresh produce. The AgroFresh organization has 40 years of post-harvest experience across a broad range of crops, including revolutionizing the apple industry with the SmartFresh™ Quality System more than 20 years ago. The AgroFresh platform is powered by our comprehensive portfolio that includes plant-based coatings, antimicrobials, digital solutions and proprietary solutions that help improve the freshness of fruit across the supply chain from harvest to the home.
AgroFresh’s market leadership is underpinned by our global footprint, extensive applied scientific and regulatory expertise, customer intimacy and growing portfolio of value-added solutions and mission-critical advisory services. Our key products are sold in approximately 50 countries, and we support customers by protecting an estimated 25,000 fruit storage rooms globally. In addition, we provide in-depth plant physiology expertise and offer a comprehensive list of solutions spanning from near-harvest to post-harvest, and from storage through to retail. More importantly, AgroFresh has been able to gain a high level of trust from our customers, which is built on four decades of interaction and support. Our direct market approach, full portfolio of solutions, high touch customer service and science-based model best position us to address our customers’ needs and differentiates us from other companies.
The following tables present a breakdown of our revenue based on crops and geography for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Note: “Other Product Solutions” include revenue from citrus, pears, kiwifruit and other crops. “EMEA” comprises Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
AgroFresh got its start in January 1996. With the acquisition of rights in proprietary 1-MCP (1-Methlycycloproprene) technology, the Company pioneered the development and commercialization of SmartFresh. This groundbreaking ethylene management solution is a plant-growth regulator that revolutionized the apple industry by allowing for long-term storage. By 2002, SmartFresh received its first registration for commercial use in Chile, with the U.S. following shortly thereafter. The benefits of this technology now serve multiple crops in all key growing regions and have helped reduce apple waste by nearly 260,000 metric tons from 2002 to 2018 in the U.S., France and Italy alone. In the past several years, AgroFresh expanded beyond SmartFresh with the introduction of Harvista, a proprietary 1-MCP formulation used in the orchard for near-harvest application in pome fruit. Harvista helps to maximize peak ripening and fruit quality. It also allows for an expanded harvest window by keeping fruit on the tree longer to achieve optimal color, size and firmness bringing the added benefit of helping growers to optimize labor management. Harvista is now approved for use in apples, pears, cherries, and blueberries. AgroFresh further expanded into new crops and post-harvest offerings with the 2017 acquisition of Tecnidex, now integrated into AgroFresh as AgroFresh Fruit Protection S.A. ("AgroFresh Fruit Protection"), a leader in the citrus industry based in Valencia, Spain, which diversified the business into fungicides, coatings, and disinfectants. As a further step towards its long-term diversification strategy, the Company launched its digital solution in 2018 with the release of FreshCloud™, its quality insights and analytics platform.
AgroFresh’s portfolio of solutions to extend the shelf life of fresh produce is subject to extensive national, state and local government regulations. The Company has completed more than 400 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown its products, including SmartFresh and Harvista, to be safe for consumers, workers and the environment. 
AgroFresh products have been approved by over 50 authorities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission.
Merger Agreement
On November 21, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Project Cloud Holdings, LLC (“Parent”), Project Cloud Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) and the Company. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of investment funds managed by Paine Schwartz Partners, LLC (“Paine Schwartz”). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company, and investment funds managed by Paine Schwartz will become the indirect owner of all the Company’s outstanding capital stock.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), and as a result of the Merger, (x) each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive $3.00 in cash, without interest (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”) and (y) the share of the Company’s Series A preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Series A Share”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive $3.00 in cash, without interest. Such conversion of Shares and the Series A Share is subject to certain exceptions, including, as applicable, for (i) Shares owned by stockholders of the Company who did not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, (ii) Shares owned by the Company and not held on behalf of third parties and (iii) Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, and as a result of the Merger, each share of Series B preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) will be (x) converted into one share of Series B convertible preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation or (y) if so elected by Parent and, in addition to the amount required to fund the Merger Consideration, Parent has secured additional financing sufficient to (i) pay the Change of Control Redemption Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company) and (ii) repay all indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company that becomes due and payable as a result of the Merger, converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Change of Control Redemption Price.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain specified closing conditions, including the approval by holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of (i) the outstanding Shares (including those held by Paine Schwartz and its affiliates) and the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, and (ii) the outstanding Shares held by stockholders who are not affiliated with Paine Schwartz, members of the Company's board of directors, certain officers of the Company, or any of their respective associates or members of their immediate family. Assuming satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted) of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company currently expects the transactions contemplated thereby to close in the first quarter of 2023.
Because the Merger is not yet complete, and except as otherwise specifically stated, the descriptions and disclosures presented elsewhere in this Report assume the continuation of AgroFresh as a public company.
Competitive Strengths

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our growth through diversification strategy:

Leading Agricultural Innovator and Solutions Provider with Proprietary Technical Know-How. Since our inception, AgroFresh has been at the forefront of fresh produce preservation solutions thanks to a research and development team who are leaders in the fields of plant post-harvest physiology and material science. The acquisition of AgroFresh Fruit Protection added significant scientific capabilities to R&D in the area of coatings, fungicides and application equipment. Beginning with our creation of the commercial market for 1-MCP (a plant growth regulator, or "PGR") applications under the SmartFresh brand for use in the preservation of apples and other crops, we have compiled an extensive and exclusive database of produce physiology and consumer preferences. Building on our proprietary technical knowledge, we have developed an intellectual property portfolio, including over 375 granted and pending patents, that has enabled us to provide comprehensive and innovative solutions to a global customer base. SmartFresh delivers a substantial improvement in storage solutions for apples, pears and other crops, allowing for significantly less waste and greater productivity, as well as a constant supply of high-quality fruit throughout the year. In the U.S., we estimate that 90% of stored apples are treated with 1-MCP, and our SmartFresh technology continues to enjoy a strong leadership position in this treatment protocol. Our recent launch of VitaFresh™ Botanicals, is the 
latest milestone in our new product innovation. VitaFresh Botanicals is a range of plant-based, edible coatings that keeps produce fresh and helps reduce food loss and waste by limiting fruit dehydration and extending freshness preservation.
Diversified Global Presence Across All Major Growing Regions. We have established a global footprint with key products approved in over 50 countries that supports customers with approximately 25,000 storage rooms globally. Our top ten customers represent less than 15% of the Company's total revenue, a sign of the strength and resilience of our business. The Company's global commercial platform is unique in the post-harvest industry, positioned across six continents, bringing a full suite of AgroFresh solutions and high-touch advisory services to customers in every key produce-growing region. Our ability to deliver in-depth technical services and products is a fundamental competitive advantage. We believe our global footprint provides not only a platform for growth but also greater diversification. As part of the diversification efforts, SmartFresh can optimize the consumer experience for a wide range of crops including pears, kiwis, avocado, broccoli, melon, tomato, mango and stone fruit. Our participation in a wide range of markets protects the business from crop size fluctuations in any particular market. For the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA, North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific (including China and India) represented 47.5%, 18.9%, 22.3% and 11.3% of sales, respectively. AgroFresh Fruit Protection meaningfully contributes to our global diversification efforts.
Service-Oriented Business Model. AgroFresh’s direct service model provides a combination of product applications with mission-critical technical advisory services, which together support our above industry average margin profile. Our sales and technical support personnel maintain direct interaction with our customers in areas of product selection, product application best practices, contract negotiations and overall customer service. Furthermore, we currently have over 40 dedicated research and development scientists, about half with advanced degrees, working around the world, including at numerous research institutes and customer sites. This infrastructure has allowed us to amass a proprietary database of technical data of applied plant physiology collected throughout our more than 40-year history. In 2022, we made approximately 36,000 monitored applications of SmartFresh. Our proprietary database gives us important insights into the causes of produce spoilage for various crops varieties in different regions as well as best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh and other quality preserving solutions. As a result, our local sales and technical service teams are best positioned to provide custom advice and solutions, giving our customers confidence and peace of mind throughout the year. Furthermore, we believe FreshCloud can further bolster our integrated offerings with the addition of data-backed solutions to monitor produce quality across the supply chain. FreshCloud is designed to deliver timely, predictive insights that will help our customers improve efficiency and enhance produce freshness. 
Diversification and Growth Opportunities Across the Produce Supply Chain. We believe there are significant growth opportunities to expand and diversify our business, supported by our track record of new product introductions and market penetration. 
One key initiative is to increase penetration of existing technologies into current and new geographic markets. While many apple growers and packers in the U.S. and globally have adopted SmartFresh, there is potential for further growth. The market penetration of apples treated with SmartFresh has been growing internationally but remains below the levels achieved in the U.S. We have also concentrated on accelerating penetration of SmartFresh into pears, plums, kiwifruit and persimmons. Based on successful trials with customers, we are also expanding our commercial activities for SmartFresh to increase its use on avocados, melons, tomatoes, broccoli and mangos, where we believe SmartFresh can optimize the consumer experience for ripeness, color, taste and texture, especially during times when the supply-chain is elongated or challenged.
Harvista is another key product where we are actively working to expand geographic and crop regulatory approvals. As of December 31, 2022, Harvista is registered in thirteen countries and we are currently working to obtain registrations in more than six additional countries including the European Union (the "EU"). In the past few years, we received regulatory approval to apply Harvista to cherries and blueberries in the U.S., blueberries in Chile and Argentina, and apples in Australia, Brazil, Ukraine, and New Zealand, and our team is working to achieve similar registrations in other markets. In 2022, we secured emergency use permits in seven European markets so that growers could utilize and take advantage of the benefits of Harvista ahead of the first approvals expected during 2025 in the Netherlands and by the end of 2025 for other EU countries and we are seeking to have these emergency uses renewed in 2023. The main limitation to accelerated growth of Harvista is the long regulatory approval cycle in important markets like the EU.
The addition of fungicides, disinfectants and coatings has helped us to diversify our crop exposure and reduce revenue seasonality and provided new growth opportunities via cross-pollination of these technologies into AgroFresh core fruit categories. As a result of all these initiatives, we have successfully diversified our proportion of SmartFresh for apples sales from nearly 78% in 2016 down to approximately 54% as of December 31, 2022. 
Building on these growth initiatives, we continuously seek opportunities to leverage our research and development ("R&D") capabilities to register and commercialize new products for currently unserved markets. At the same time, we are evaluating mergers and acquisition ("M&A") opportunities similar to AgroFresh Fruit Protection (formerly Tecnidex), as another key strategy to enhance our value proposition and drive diversified growth. 
Long-Standing Relationships with Highly Diverse Customer Base. We believe our direct service model coupled with our proprietary solutions have helped us develop deep, trusted and long-tenured relationships with a diverse array of global customers including packers, growers and retailers. For over 40 years, we have operated with a large team of commercial and technical experts located in key geographies around the world to provide on-site custom advisory services. This infrastructure helps us maintain intimate and consistent interaction with our customers throughout the year to understand all aspects of harvest operations, address a variety of customer-specific issues, and ultimately improve the economics for growers, packers and retailers across the supply chain. As a result of our unique service model and comprehensive solutions, we have developed direct customer relationships in approximately 50 countries and are working with strategic customers to penetrate new geographies and markets. 
“Asset-light, High-touch” Model Generates Strong Profit Margins and Free Cash Flow. Our technical expertise, long-standing customer relationships and asset-light business model drive attractive profit margins. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated gross margins and adjusted EBITDA margins1 of 67% and 35%, respectively. In addition, we employ an “asset-light”, outsourced production model. We use a third-party manufacturer, and have an approved qualified alternative, for our key active ingredient, 1-MCP, under a long-term contract with strict confidentiality obligations, and several other suppliers to formulate products and provide packaging services. For the manufacturing of coatings, disinfectants and equipment servicing the citrus market, we employ a manufacturing plant in Spain and use several local suppliers to formulate products and assemble equipment. As a result, our manufacturing footprint requires low capital investment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, capital expenditures were $4.1 million, or 2.6% of net sales. Our attractive margin profile coupled with our asset-light strategy result in strong free cash flow, which we expect to use to reinvest in the business and repay debt. 
Strong Management Team with Deep Industry Experience. Our management team has extensive global agricultural industry experience and a proven track record of bringing innovative, value-added solutions to customers and markets around the world. The Company’s management team boasts over 125 years of combined relevant industry experience and is led by Clinton A. Lewis Jr., our chief executive officer, who brings 30-plus years of experience in the life sciences space, serving in a number of national and international leadership roles at Pfizer and Zoetis, the world’s largest animal health company.
During the past several years, our management team has effectively launched new products, established new partnerships across the supply chain and implemented a diversification strategy to drive expansion into new crop types, solutions and geographies. 
The Company made several appointments to its senior leadership team in 2021-2022 that are intended to position the Company for consistent, profitable growth and to further drive the Company's diversification strategy. We believe our management team has the vision, expertise, and experience to position us for continued success as they implement our growth through diversification strategy.
Industry Overview

Food Preservation and Freshness

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, over 1.3 billion metric tons of food, or approximately one third of the total food produced worldwide, is lost to spoilage or waste each year, and as much as one half of fruits and vegetables perish before being consumed. Euromonitor reports that retailers are often judged on their fresh food selection. A significant percentage of food waste at the retail level is based on qualitative factors related to consumer perception of freshness. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2015 the first-ever domestic goal to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030.
Loss or shrinkage along the food supply chain has various causes, including degradation of fresh produce during storage and transportation.
AgroFresh strives to be the guardian of the world’s fresh produce and stands ready to lead the fresh produce industry into a more sustainable future. In 2019, we completed a detailed sustainability study about the influence of SmartFresh on the apple industry. From 2002 to 2018, we estimate that 260,000 metric tons of apple waste was prevented in the U.S., France, and Italy alone. This reduced apple spoilage equates to more than 2.5 million metric tons of water. We estimate that improving the apple supply chain in those three countries alone yielded an annual reduction of 800 thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the air, which is equivalent to taking approximately 170,000 cars off the road each year. As AgroFresh invests in innovative technologies and diversifies to an even broader assortment of crops and markets, the Company is poised to make even greater contributions to the world’s sustainable food supply.
1 EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information, and for a reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss.
The fight against food waste and the conservation of our natural resources drives what we do at AgroFresh. For more than 40 years, we have been delivering innovative solutions that enhance the fresh produce supply chain process of growers, packers, and retailers. In 2021, AgroFresh became a participant of the World Resources Institute’s Champions 12.3 initiative focused on accelerating progress of Target 12.3, which calls for cutting in half per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level and reducing food losses along the production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses, by the year 2030.
Near-Harvest Treatments

We consider applications in the orchard as “near-harvest” since they are applied right before the fruit is harvested and have synergistic effect with our post-harvest solutions. Near-harvest treatments are commonly used to improve the quality of crops and reduce harvest losses. The use of Harvista helps pome fruit growers realize better quality and bigger harvests from their orchards, while providing more control over how and when their fruit ripens, which can assist in labor management during the critical harvest window. The unique mode of action provides better control of ethylene response, so fruit matures on the grower’s schedule, helping expand the harvest window for optimal color, size and firmness.

Post-Harvest Treatments

Post-harvest treatments include treatments to manage the effects of ethylene, to prevent microbial contamination and to reduce dehydration. Naturally occurring ethylene triggers the acceleration of ripening in certain crops, reducing post-harvest life.
Controlled Atmosphere ("CA") and Dynamic Controlled Atmosphere (“DCA”) systems are used to keep stored crops within their optimal ranges of temperature and levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Specific oxygen and carbon dioxide levels can lower respiration in fresh produce and delay ripening. CA systems have been used for many decades with fruits and vegetables to preserve freshness. DCA, a more recent innovation, seeks to adjust levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide dynamically as the produce in storage breathes and matures. CA and DCA are only effective at preserving freshness while the fruit is kept in cold storage. However, 1-MCP treatments have been found to be complementary to these technologies by helping to better maintain the quality of apples and pears during cold storage and maintaining freshness for up to 90 days after they are removed from cold storage.

Our Business
We are an AgTech innovator in proprietary advanced technologies that enhance the freshness, quality and value of fresh produce. We currently offer SmartFresh applications at customer sites through a direct service model utilizing third-party contractors. We also provide advisory services based on our extensive knowledge on the use of 1-MCP collected through hundreds of thousands of monitored applications done as a part of the service model. Our pricing to customers is based on the service provided, not on the product sold. We operate in approximately 50 countries and derive most of our revenue working with customers to protect the value of apples, pears and other produce during storage. SmartFresh diversification efforts are focused on expanding use in underserved crops and regions, such as the U.S. and South America. Harvista is approved for sale in Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Israel, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, the United States and New Zealand. ActiMist was launched in the U.S. and in 2022 launched in Australia and we are seeking to expand into other countries subject to regulatory approval. In support of our growth through diversification strategy, line extensions and new services are planned for introduction to seek to strengthen our global position in post-harvest storage and to capitalize on adjacent growth opportunities in near-harvest markets.
1-MCP, the active ingredient in key solutions such as SmartFresh, Harvista and Ethylbloc, is an ethylene action inhibitor with a proven ability to maintain freshness and extend the shelf life of fresh produce. The 1-MCP molecule is structurally close to ethylene, a naturally occurring plant hormone that occurs in certain fruits and vegetables. Ethylene helps produce grow and ripen, but it eventually causes over-ripening and spoilage. 1-MCP works by blocking the ethylene receptors in plant cells, which temporarily delays the ripening process, enabling the produce to better maintain the qualities associated with freshness.
Fruits and vegetables are classified as climacteric or non-climacteric, a term referring to the process of fruit maturation. Climacteric fruits can ripen after being picked and produce much more ethylene than non-climacteric fruits, which cannot ripen after harvest. The climacteric event is a stage of fruit ripening associated with higher ethylene production and changes in the fruit including pigment changes and sugar release. The climacteric event marks the peak of edible ripeness, with fruits having the best taste and texture for consumption. The role of SmartFresh is to delay the onset of the climacteric stage until the product is ready for consumption. Apples, pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmon, bananas, melons, peaches and tomatoes are examples of climacteric fruit. The Company continues to evaluate the commercial value of 1-MCP with a range of other climacteric fruit.
AgroFresh extended its post-harvest leadership with the acquisition of AgroFresh Fruit Protection, a leading provider of fungicides, disinfectants and coatings primarily focused on the citrus market. For over 40 years, AgroFresh Fruit Protection has been helping fruit and vegetable producers offer clean, safe and high-quality products to customers in 18 countries with strength 
in the Mediterranean growing region. AgroFresh Fruit Protection helped to expand our R&D capabilities and to enable us to leverage ActiMist, an innovative delivery system of foggable fungicides. Our fungicide and coatings offerings further diversify our revenue by expanding our ability to provide solutions and service to the citrus industry.
SmartFresh Value Proposition
The SmartFreshTM Quality System, our flagship solution, preserves the texture, firmness, taste and appearance of produce during storage, transportation and retail display. Available in “storage room” and “on-the-move” application formats, the SmartFresh Quality System is the original, most recognizable post-harvest choice to maintain consumer-desired produce freshness and quality and reduce waste. It allows growers and packers to deliver “just harvested” freshness on a year-round basis and enables retailers to increase customer satisfaction with fresh, high-quality produce. An integral part of the SmartFresh value proposition is a direct service model providing customers with on-site applications of SmartFresh at their storage facilities together with mission-critical and value-added advisory services. AgroFresh™ Verified is our proprietary analysis and reporting service that provides confirmation of a successful SmartFresh application in storage rooms. 
The value of SmartFresh with any crop is determined by both the biological efficacy with that crop and the utility value the application delivers to the customer. The biological efficacy with apples is high; apples are sensitive to ethylene, and SmartFresh is effective at delaying ripening. In addition, SmartFresh brings high utility value by helping to keep apples fresh year-round despite their narrow harvest window, effectively extending the marketing window for growers and packers to monetize their crop. This has resulted in the widespread adoption of SmartFresh by apple growers and packers worldwide. The cost of SmartFresh translates into less than one cent per pound of apples in the United States, which is small relative to both the value of the crop and the importance of maintaining the quality of that crop during storage. Retail prices of apples in the U.S. typically range from $1.30-$4.50 per pound depending on the variety. The use of SmartFresh gives growers and packers the ability to store apples from one season to the next without losing their just picked quality characteristics.
Beneficial effects of SmartFresh have been proven across numerous apple varieties throughout the world. SmartFresh is also effective with other crops that are highly sensitive to ethylene, including pears, kiwifruit, plums, persimmons, avocados, melons, tomatoes, and broccoli, each of which requires a different application method and supply chain logistics beyond storage rooms. We also offer a corresponding solution for flowers, marketed under the EthylBloc brand name through two strategic partners that have a strong position in the global flower market.
AgroFresh’s business historically has been highly seasonal, driven by the timing of apple and pear harvests in the northern and southern hemispheres. The first half of the year is when the southern hemisphere harvest occurs, and the second half of the year is when the northern hemisphere harvest occurs. Since the northern hemisphere harvest of our two core crops of apples and pears is typically larger, a significant portion of our sales and profits are historically generated in the second half of the year. In addition to this seasonality, factors such as weather patterns may impact the timing of the harvest within the two halves of the year. Crop diversification is an important strategy to achieve more balanced revenues across the year, and the ability to service the citrus segment provides an opportunity for the Company to increase revenue in the fourth and first quarters, which are the two strongest quarters for citrus crops.
SmartFresh Service Model

We believe that we have developed deep, trusted relationships with our customers by combining our effective SmartFresh product with application expertise and trusted advisory services. Over the past decade we have amassed a valuable proprietary database of technical information on the best practices for the effective use of SmartFresh on a wide range of apple and pear varieties, since each fruit and fruit variety requires a different treatment protocol. The advisory services component utilizes this information to help maximize the profitability of our customers’ operations. 
Harvista

Complementing our post-harvest solutions, Harvista is used for near-harvest management of apples, pears, cherries and blueberries. Our Harvista product line includes proprietary 1-MCP formulations that are specifically designed to slow ripening, reduce fruit drop and hold fruit on the tree longer to promote better color and fruit size, which are beneficial to the grower. With wide flexibility in application timing, it extends the harvest window by allowing growers to factor in ever-changing weather conditions and labor availability. We have found that the combination of Harvista in the orchard and SmartFresh in the storage room results in improved fruit quality metrics compared to use of either product individually.
Harvista extends the “ideal harvest window” for up to an additional 14 days. This added flexibility creates significant benefits both in terms of harvest logistics and crop profitability. Widening the harvest window allows for better scheduling and the optimization of limited resources, such as harvest crews and equipment. Overall, crop value is enhanced by bigger average fruit size, better color and fewer defects.
We offer Harvista through a pre-scheduled application service including ground and/or aerial applications depending on the crop and growing region. Typically, our technical staff designs the protocol in consultation with the customer, and either a third-party service provider or the customer makes the application. 
Harvista is currently available in Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, Ukraine, Turkey and the United States. In addition to apple and pear crops, Harvista has received approval for applications to cherries and blueberries in the U.S. and Chile. We expect to pursue additional registrations and label expansions as new formulations and/or crop concepts are validated.
VitaFresh Botanicals
In 2021, we launched VitaFresh Botanicals, which is a proprietary, plant-based portfolio of coatings solutions for a wide variety of crops including citrus, avocados and mangoes. VitaFresh Botanicals utilize “anti-thirst” technology to boost the skin’s natural protection, creating a “double skin” membrane in fruit that reduces dehydration, maintains weight and locks in produce freshness throughout the supply chain. The solutions are completely turnkey and easy-to-apply as part of regular packinghouse operations. AgroFresh provides customers with all the necessary application equipment and expertise.
VitaFresh Botanicals coatings are sustainably sourced and created using certified ISO 14001 “environmental management system” standards. Excellent crop coverage at low application rates offers better cost efficiencies to operators and gives retailers a much stronger opportunity to market quality produce, while reducing food waste, increasing customer profit potential, and adding the capability to reduce the amount of plastic packaging needed for the produce.
Fungicides, Coatings and Disinfectants
In addition to VitaFresh Botanicals, we have a complete line of fungicide, coating and disinfectant solutions across various crops and application types.
ActiMistTM / ActiSealTM
Antimicrobial technology is generally delivered by airborne or liquid systems including drenching or tank. ActiMist is a thermo-fogged fungicide that works simultaneously with SmartFresh for convenience and enhanced storage room logistics. ActiSeal, a portfolio of liquid fungicides, offers broad-spectrum protection based on a full portfolio of active ingredients, and is delivered via drencher or tank.  Together, these fungicides provide control of a broad spectrum of post-harvest diseases and help to protect against a wide range of fungal threats on pome, citrus and stone fruit. 
TeycerTM Originals
Teycer Originals includes a full line of coatings to improve produce freshness, quality and appearance, increase shelf life and reduce food loss. These traditional edible coatings, including some with fungal protection, are used primarily for citrus, pome fruit and tropical fruit. 
FreshStartTM
FreshStart is a full portfolio of biodegradable detergents and disinfectants for cleaning fruit and packaging equipment in packinghouses and reducing the threat of diseases during storage and transportation for citrus, pome fruit, stone fruit and other crops. They remove traces of sooty mold and other particles from the surface of the fruits as well as help to improve the protection of fruit against most of the main post-harvest diseases. With formulations that include fungicide and fruit preservatives, they also help increase fruit shelf life. The FreshStart line of disinfectants are used on surfaces, boxes, bins and tools in the packinghouse and during transport. FreshStart fruit disinfectants have low impact on the environment as they degrade quickly without leaving residues. They also can help decrease contaminants in water treatment and recycling systems and help make water recycling more efficient and less costly. FreshStart surface disinfectants help keep packinghouses, rooms and processing equipment free of fungus. They are useful for water recycling systems, and they work as a complement to fungicides for optimal rot control.
Control-Tec™
Control-Tec is a leading range of post-harvest systems and equipment for the application of antimicrobials, coatings, detergents and sustainable water management for packinghouses, packing lines and storage rooms.  The Control-Tec portfolio also includes controlled-atmosphere solutions including automated ripening and de-greening control. 
FreshCloud
We continue to evolve and expand our FreshCloud digital technology service platform of produce monitoring and screening solutions. FreshCloud Quality Inspection is a proprietary cloud-based mobile quality management service that digitizes what was formerly a manual quality control process to capture, organize and analyze quality metrics in real time. The service combines digital information from many different physical and digital sources and locations, including analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. This allows growers, packers, shippers and retailers to drive accuracy and consistency across their operations. FreshCloud Harvest View is an easy-to-use digital service that complements Harvista. FreshCloud Harvest View captures, organizes and presents fast and easy-to-access data insights on starch hydrolysis progression, thereby enabling growers to make timely decisions on when to apply Harvista, intended to maximize quality and yields for higher profit potential. FreshCloud Storage Insights combines proprietary technology and data analytics in the storage room to offer customers real-time insights into the condition of their stored fruit. 
Marketing and Sales
The Company's post-harvest business includes solutions designed to improve yields for growers and packers. These solutions include SmartFresh, Harvista, ActiMist, digital services platform FreshCloud and a large range of antimicrobials, disinfectants, coatings, and packinghouse equipment, marketed under the brands Actiseal, FreshStart, VitaFresh Botanicals, Teycer Originals and Control-Tec, respectively.
AgroFresh's global sales teams are organized geographically across the Europe/Middle East, North America, South America and Asia Pacific regions designed to drive growth and accelerate diversification. 
The technical sales support group supports the sales team and runs customer-specific trials for local crop varieties or specialized storage and distribution conditions and conducts follow-up with customers. This team works closely with customers to provide advice on appropriate protocols for SmartFresh, Harvista and other product applications such as coatings and fungicides depending on crop, variety, region, and climatic conditions. The technical sales support group draws on our extensive knowledge base of 1-MCP applications across all regions and conditions.
The marketing function is organized on a global and regional basis. This consists of corporate brand/image stewardship and regionally driven marketing management including country-specific marketing strategies, plans and tactics to drive growth and customer penetration. Marketing personnel are embedded within the Company’s operating regions to improve collaboration with local sales teams and customers and capitalize on business opportunities. 

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2022, 2021 or 2020. 

Competition

Post-harvest solutions include 1-MCP-based solutions, fungicides and coatings. The market for 1-MCP use is evolving and we have faced competition since our 1-MCP use patent expired in 2014. We estimate that citrus post-harvest applications represent approximately 60% of the total core post-harvest market, which is why we are focused on seeking to grow further in this important crop segment. The market for post-harvest solutions is fragmented with numerous regional suppliers. The four leading providers, including AgroFresh, account for more than half of global post-harvest sales. Other regional and local companies, mainly in citrus, account for the remaining post-harvest sales. Additional key players in the post-harvest industry include fungicide suppliers, such as Syngenta and Janssen PMP, which hold post-harvest registrations of fungicides previously approved for pre-harvest applications, and which use post-harvest companies, including AgroFresh, to distribute their products. In the near-harvest segment, ReTainTM is a competitive technology to Harvista that is offered in all regions except for the EU. We believe that the principal factors of competition in our industry include reputation, product quality, customer service and customer intimacy, product innovation, technical service and value creation. We believe that we compete favorably with competitors based on these and other factors. See the subsection titled “Competitive Strengths” above.
Research and Development

Research and development plays an important role at AgroFresh in providing technical support to our customers as well as building our product pipeline by identifying and developing innovative new offerings and line extensions of existing products. AgroFresh R&D is a global function with less than half of our R&D resources located in facilities in North America, and the remainder across our other regions. During fruit harvest times, we hire additional third-party contract scientists to assist AgroFresh in the execution of experiments involving Harvista, SmartFresh, VitaFresh Botanicals and ActiMist technologies. Most of the regional research and development facilities focus on business aligned research and development initiatives to develop line extensions and create new products. Research and development leverage our core competencies in a number of technical areas including post-harvest physiology, analytical chemistry, regulatory sciences, regulatory affairs, formulation science, formulation process development, organic chemistry and delivery systems. Initiatives focused on next generation solutions utilize expertise in material science, molecular biology, post-harvest pathology, diagnostics and sensor technology. Where appropriate, we partner with external companies and universities to strengthen our internal competencies. Our internal and external R&D activities focus on developing sustainable, natural solutions intended to address our customers' current and future challenges.
Intellectual Property

We are a technology-based solutions provider and, as such, rely on a combination of important intellectual property strengths, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, service providers and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential including, but not limited to, information related to our proprietary manufacturing process and SmartFresh service model. In the normal course of business, we provide access to our intellectual property and/or our products protected by our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements.
Today a majority of our SmartFresh applications use SmartFresh ProTabsTM, an application method patented through 2022. Harvista formulations are patent protected through at least 2027. We continue to invest in application technologies as a means to provide our customers with the most relevant, convenient and effective solutions for their specific operations. Our portfolio of intellectual property totals more than 375 granted patents and patent applications in over 50 countries. 
Regulation and Compliance

We are subject to extensive national, state and local government regulations, and the Company has a regulatory team that we believe is best in class, which leverages a global network of highly experienced regulatory consultants. Through this network, we have successfully obtained registrations for SmartFresh, Harvista and LandSpring in every country where the review process has been completed, and the registration process for Harvista continues in many additional countries. We have completed more than 400 comprehensive international health and environmental tests that have shown the AgroFresh family of products, including SmartFresh and Harvista, are safe for consumers, workers and the environment. 1-MCP, the active ingredient in many AgroFresh products, is metabolized by the natural processes in apples and other fruits and leaves no detectable residue when used according to the label instructions. The products have been approved by over 50 authorities including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the European Commission. We do not anticipate any significant problems in obtaining future required licenses, permits or approvals necessary to expand our business. We leverage our regulatory capabilities as we expand the fungicide product lines into new countries.

Employees

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 300 full-time employees. None of our employees in North America are members of a union or subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. In certain other countries where we operate (including Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Spain), employees are members of unions or are represented by works councils. In addition, certain of our activities have been performed historically by seasonal and part-time third-party staff.
