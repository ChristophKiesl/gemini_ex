Introduction



We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 14, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of effecting merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying businesses that are either directly or indirectly connected with the music sector, with particular emphasis on businesses where our significant strategic and operational expertise and long-standing position within the music industry will be a value-additive proposition to potential target businesses. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us.



Our Sponsor is Music Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability company. The registration statement on Form S-1 for our Initial Public Offering (the “Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”) was declared effective on February 2, 2021. On February 5, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units, the “Public Shares”), which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the company (“Warrants”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, pursuant to the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-252152). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230.0 million.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 6,600,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) to our Sponsor, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to us of $6.6 million.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement (including the additional Units and additional Private Placement Warrants sold in connection with the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), a total of $230,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, including $8,050,000, of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, were placed in a Trust Account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or February 5, 2023, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



Management Expertise



Our Leadership



Our management team and board of directors consists of seasoned industry executives that have collaborated and worked together for many years, and possess deep collective understanding of music, digital entertainment, social media and technology, as well as the evolution of these sectors and market opportunities. Our management team represents a unique combination of operating, investing, financial and transactional experience.



Neil Jacobson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since inception, is a 20-year veteran of the music business. Mr. Jacobson spent the majority of his career at Interscope Geffen A&M Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, where he held positions as a publicist, Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President, and participated in the management of artists and producers such as will.i.am, Robin Thicke and Jeff Bhasker. In January 2016 Mr. Jacobson was appointed President of Geffen Records, a historic record label re-established under Interscope Geffen A&M Records, and held that position until January 2020. During his tenure as President of Geffen Records, Mr. Jacobson oversaw the signing of Darkroom Records, home to Billie Eilish. In January 2020, Mr. Jacobson founded Hallwood Media, an independent music management company exclusively focused on songwriters and producers. Over the last 24 months acting as a trusted advisor to artists and creators, Mr. Jacobson has helped coordinate the sale of artist catalogs for an aggregate total in excess of $150 million. For the past four years, Mr. Jacobson has been a member of the Young Presidents Organization (YPO), which serves as a global leadership community to improve lives, businesses and the world.

Todd Lowen, our Chief Operating Officer and one of our directors, has 20 years of experience in finance and investment. Mr. Lowen spent the majority of his career in the Equity Derivatives businesses of Lehman Brothers and Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, where he advised institutional investors, such as hedge funds and pension funds, on event driven investment strategies relating to, and including, merger arbitrage, spin-offs/splits, exchange offers, tenders, and special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”). Mr. Lowen served as a Managing Director of Olivetree Financial, LLC from 2016 to 2021, where he helped further establish its U.S. Event Driven Business, building a team around similar strategies, with a particular recent focus on SPACs. In October 2021, Mr. Lowen joined Cantor Fitzgerald as Head of its Event Driven Equities Business. Away from the office, Mr. Lowen is actively involved with Success Academy Charter Schools, which help provide world class education opportunities to children from all backgrounds in New York, as well as City Harvest, a food rescue and re-distribution organization in New York City.



Mr. Jacobson and Mr. Lowen each have a distinguished record of accomplishment in their respective industries. As an international publicist for Interscope, Mr. Jacobson traveled globally with artists such as Eminem, 50 Cent, and the Black Eyed Peas. His close relationship with Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am led to his introduction to industry legend, future mentor and Beats by Dre co-founder Jimmy Iovine and eventual appointment to President of Geffen Records in 2016. Mr. Jacobson has spent two decades operating in the music business across a variety of roles. His experience spans many different geographies/continents, and he has represented talent across North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. During his time in the music industry, Mr. Jacobson has worked with some of the most recognizable talent in the world including Eminem, Gwen Stefani, Black Eyed Peas, Avicii and DJ Snake. We believe that prospective target companies will benefit from the guidance and insight that Mr. Jacobson can provide through mentorship, governance and operational involvement and experience.



Over the course of his 20-year career in finance, Mr. Lowen has advised over 150 institutional investors on event driven investments and trading strategies across 500+ unique mergers, spin-offs, exchange offers, tenders, and SPACs. Most recently, Mr. Lowen has re-focused on the SPAC market, providing insight, analysis, and investment strategy around the SPAC asset class, covering entities from their pre-IPO filings all the way through to their status as public companies and through consummation of their ultimate respective business combinations.



We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive business combination opportunities with a compelling industry backdrop and an opportunity for transformational growth. Our objectives are to generate attractive returns for our stockholders and enhance value by improving operational performance of the acquired company. We believe our management’s strong reputation within the industry sectors targeted by us, together with its vast network of key industry participants built over decades, will give us the ability to identify attractive opportunities that would thrive in the public markets. We also believe that our management team can add significant value to a newly public company through extensive industry knowledge, marketing and financial expertise, as well as a network of strategic investors and resources.

Mr. Balogun also serves on the Global Citizen Entertainment Advisory Board.



We believe our directors bring additional expertise that will enhance our ability to identify and execute our initial business combination, and may enhance our ability to execute upon various value creation initiatives after the successful completion of our initial business combination.



With respect to the foregoing experiences of our leadership team, past performance is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team’s performance as indicative of our future performance. Other than Mr. Lowen, none of the members of our leadership team has any past experience with blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies. For more information on the experience and background of our management team, see the section entitled “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”



Our Approach



Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management and directors and can benefit from their operational and investment expertise. We intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying businesses that are either directly or indirectly connected to music, with particular emphasis on businesses where our specific expertise and positioning within the music industry will be a value-additive proposition to our targets. Our selection process will leverage Mr. Jacobson’s and Mr. Lowen’s broad and deep relationship network, unique industry experiences and deal sourcing capabilities to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities.



We expect these networks will provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Since the Initial Public Offering, members of our management team have communicated with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and to begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads.

Business Strategy



Streaming has fundamentally changed the music industry and as a result, consumers engage with music in more ways than ever. According to International Federation of the Phonographic Institute (IFPI), global paid music streaming subscribers totaled 341 million at the end of 2019. While this represents an increase of 34% from 255 million at the end of 2018, it still represents less than 11% of the 3.5 billion smartphone users globally, according to Statista. Additionally, technological innovation has helped facilitate the penetration of music listening across locations, including homes, offices and cars, as well as across devices, including smartphones, tablets, wearables, digital dashboards, gaming consoles and smart speakers. These technologies represent advancements that are deepening listener engagement and driving further growth in music consumption. Concurrently, the age of social media and micro-content has given significant rise to the various ways consumers discover, engage and share music. This increase in consumption across device and format has led to increased monetization opportunities of music content, supporting the continued growth in music industry revenues.



We believe there are several macro themes that will dominate the music industry and adjacent ecosystems and present significant opportunities. These investment themes include, but are not limited to:




● | Audio Content: In today’s landscape, consumer-facing companies depend on music to make meaningful connections with their customers, while film and television similarly depend on music as a key storytelling medium. As music licensing becomes increasingly enforced, those who hold copyrights have immense leverage across a wide range of industries. We plan to explore potential target companies serving content creators, IP owners and consumers by unlocking new opportunities for content discovery and monetization. Our depth and breadth of relationships across the entire audio industry, including recorded music labels and music publishers, streaming platforms, podcasting platforms, voice platforms, agencies and other emerging platforms, position us to uniquely source and evaluate opportunities for potential targets in this sector. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology: The dramatic advancements in the music industry are largely driven by pioneering technology companies. As these advancements continue to reshape the industry, the companies who partner with these pioneers stand to benefit. Conversely, a company with a proprietary algorithm requires a partner in the music industry in order to make a meaningful impact in the sector. Through decades of experience in both the music industry and finance, we offer a value-add which is seldom found among burgeoning tech companies. Given our deep relationships across the broader technology ecosystem, we plan to evaluate potential target companies that are poised to benefit from strong secular tailwinds including automation, livestreaming, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Select verticals of interest include royalty free sample libraries (for production music), music catalog analysis and organization tools, data science and trend research companies, blockchain and other AI-driven platforms. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Social: Social media has become a primary means of music discovery, allowing for consumer engagement and interaction in ways that other traditional platforms, such as radio, cannot. Platforms such as TikTok and Triller have provided new life to music, while their survival symbiotically depends on that of the music industry. The size of a user base defines any social platform, and achieving critical mass is of the utmost importance. Music is a tried and tested way to accelerate this process. We can offer a unique value-add to companies including but not limited to social media networking apps, social content platforms and online video sharing platforms. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer: Music plays an important role in the ways brands connect with their customers. Whether through advertising or the product experience itself, music is a core emotional component that often bonds or drives the user to the product. By 2026, Gen Z is expected to comprise the largest sector of the U.S. consumer population according to A.T. Kearney ‘Consumers @ 250 Report’. Music is increasingly becoming an important part of Gen Z’s lifestyle. According to BI Intelligence / Edison Research ‘The Infinite Dial 2020’, 86% of people in the U.S. aged between 12 and 34 listen to online audio on at least a monthly basis. Brands that have been able to adapt and adopt music as a key driver, both in consumer experience and partnerships, have found significant success in recent years. Examples include Beats by Dre and Peloton. We believe we can provide immediate value to any consumer-facing company with proprietary access to top-level music and artists, resources and connections within the industry and an ability to navigate, contact and execute music licenses. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria



Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any or all of these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:

● | have a defensible market position, with business models that are differentiated from or disruptive to entrenched competitors and which create barriers to entry against new competitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | are at an inflection point and can benefit from our leadership’s knowledge of the target sectors and robust industry relationships to drive improved financial performance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have a strong, experienced management team which would benefit from our leadership’s network or expertise;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide a scalable platform for add-on acquisitions, which we believe will be an opportunity for our management team to deliver incremental stockholder value after the initial business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are valued attractively relative to their existing cash flows and potential for operational improvement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | offer an attractive potential return for our stockholders, weighing potential growth opportunities and operational improvements in the target business against any identified downside risks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can benefit from being publicly-traded, are prepared to be a publicly-traded company, are capable of generating consistent returns in excess of cost of capital, and can effectively utilize access to the capital markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).



Initial Business Combination



The NYSE listing rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it likely that our board of directors will be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects.



We will have until 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.

On February 2, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



Our Business Combination Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.



Sources of Target Business



We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus from the Initial Public Offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). In addition, since the date that our securities were first listed on NYSE, we have paid an affiliate of our Sponsor $15,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of our management team. Any such payments prior to our initial business combination are made from funds held outside the Trust Account. Other than the foregoing, there will be no finder’s fees, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation paid by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any affiliate of our Sponsor or officers prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, or from completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Human Capital Resources



We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements



We have registered our units, Class A common stock and Public Warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for our second completed fiscal year as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.

On February 2, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equal or exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
