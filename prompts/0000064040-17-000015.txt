Item 1. Business
Overview
S&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels. We were incorporated in December of 1925 under the laws of the state of New York.
On April 27, 2016, we changed our name to S&P Global Inc. from McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.
We have repositioned S&P Global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. In 2016, we continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. A discussion of significant changes that were made to our portfolio during the three years ended December 31, 2016 can be found within “MD&A – Overview” contained in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Businesses
Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Ratings, Market and Commodities Intelligence and S&P Dow Jones Indices ("Indices"). For a discussion on the competitive conditions in our businesses, see “MD&A – Segment Review” contained in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of these segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts are included in a new reportable segment named Market and Commodities Intelligence. Our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure. 
Ratings
Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and other market participants. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the debt issue may default.
With offices in over 25 countries around the world, Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents Ratings serves are investors, corporations, governments, municipalities, commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and other debt issuers.
As the capital markets continue to evolve, Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities, driven by continuing regulatory changes, through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.
Ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:

• | ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;


• | bank loan ratings; and


• | corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have a Ratings credit rating.

Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics.
Market and Commodities Intelligence
Market and Commodities Intelligence's portfolio of capabilities are designed to help the financial community track performance, generate better investment returns, identify new trading and investment ideas, perform risk analysis, develop mitigation strategies and provide high-value information to the commodity and energy markets that enable its customers to make better informed trading and business decisions. The key constituents Market and Commodities Intelligence serves are asset managers; investment banks; investors; brokers; financial advisors; insurance companies; investment sponsors; companies’ back-office functions, including compliance, operations, risk, clearance, and settlement; and producers, traders, and intermediaries within energy, metals and agriculture markets.
Market and Commodities Intelligence includes the following business lines:

• | Financial Data & Analytics — a product suite that provides data, analytics and third-party research for global finance professionals, which includes the S&P Capital IQ Desktop, SNL, Leveraged Commentary & Data, Investment Advisory and integrated bulk data feeds that can be customized, which include CUSIP and Compustat;


• | Risk Services — commercial arm that sells Ratings' credit ratings and related data, analytics and research, which includes subscription-based offerings, RatingsDirect® and RatingsXpress®; and


• | S&P Global Platts — the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets. S&P Global Platts provides essential price data, analytics, and industry insight that enable the commodities and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency. Additionally, S&P Global Platts generates revenue from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges.

As of September 7, 2016, we completed the sale of J.D. Power and the results are included in Market and Commodities Intelligence results through that date.
Indices
Indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs. Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets. 
Indices primarily derives revenue from asset linked fees based on the S&P and Dow Jones indices and to a lesser extent generates subscription revenue and transaction revenue. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:

• | Investment vehicles — asset linked fees such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and mutual funds, that are based on S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks and generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;


• | Exchange traded derivatives — generate royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;


• | Index-related licensing fees — fixed or variable annual and per-issue fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and


• | Data and customized index subscription fees — fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.
