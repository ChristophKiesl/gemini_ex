MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA AND FORECASTS 
This Annual Report includes historical data, forecasts and information obtained from independent sources such as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the National Association of Realtors ("NAR"), the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), trade associations, industry publications and surveys, and other information available to us. Some data is also based on our good faith estimates, which are derived from management’s knowledge of the industry and independent source. While we believe that the industry data presented herein is derived from the most widely recognized sources for reporting U.S. residential housing market statistical data, we caution that such information is subject to change and do not endorse or suggest reliance on this data or information alone. 
Forecasts regarding rates of home ownership, sales price, volume of homesales, and other metrics included in this Annual Report to describe the housing industry are inherently uncertain or speculative in nature and actual results for any period could materially differ. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but such information may not be accurate or complete. We have not independently verified any of the data from third-party sources nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Statements as to our market position are based on market data currently available to us. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding industry data provided herein, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based upon various factors, including those discussed under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements." Similarly, we believe our internal research is reliable, even though such research has not been verified by any independent sources.
Note regarding NAR revision of Average Sale Price Data. Please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 25, 2022 for information concerning NAR's revision of average sales price data for U.S. existing homes and its cautionary language with respect to the comparability and reliability of such data as well as related matters.
Industry Overview 
Industry definition. We primarily operate in the U.S. residential real estate industry and derive substantially all of our revenues from serving the needs of buyers and sellers of existing homes rather than new homes manufactured and sold by homebuilders. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a commission that is based on a percentage of the price of each home sold. As a result, the real estate industry generally benefits from rising home prices and increasing homesale transactions (and conversely is adversely impacted by falling prices and lower 
homesale transactions). We believe that existing homesale transactions and the services associated with these transactions, such as mortgage origination, title services and relocation services, represent one of the most attractive segments of the residential real estate industry for the following reasons:
•the existing homesales segment represents a significantly larger addressable market than new homesales. Of the approximately 5.7 million homesales in the U.S. in 2022, NAR estimates that approximately 5 million were existing homesales, representing approximately 89% of the overall sales as measured in units;
•existing homesales afford us the opportunity to represent either the buyer or the seller and in some cases both the buyer and the seller; and
•we are able to generate revenues from ancillary services provided to our customers.
Our business model relies heavily on affiliated independent sales agents, who play a critical consumer-facing role in the home buying and selling experience for both our company owned and franchise brokerages. While substantially all homebuyers start their search for a home using the Internet, according to NAR, approximately 86% of home buyers and home sellers used an agent or broker in 2022. We believe that agents or brokers will continue to be directly involved in most home purchases and sales, primarily because real estate transactions have certain characteristics that benefit from the service and value offered by an agent or broker, including the following:
•the average homesale transaction value is very high and generally is the largest transaction one does in a lifetime;
•homesale transactions occur infrequently;
•there is a compelling need for personal service as home preferences are unique to each buyer;
•a high level of support is required given the complexity associated with the process, including specific marketing and technology services as well as assistance with the inspection process; 
•the consumer preference to visit properties for sale in person, notwithstanding the availability of online images and property tours; and
•there is a high variance in price, depending on neighborhood, floor plan, architecture, fixtures, and outdoor space. 
Cyclical nature of industry, long-term demographics and seasonality. The U.S. residential real estate industry tends to be cyclical, with downturns (such as that experienced from 2006 to 2011) followed by periods of recovery and growth (such as that experienced from 2012 to 2021). The industry typically is affected by changes in general economic and residential real estate conditions which are beyond our control.
We believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry is primarily driven by the affordability of housing, the economic health of the U.S. economy, demographic trends such as generational transitions, increases in U.S. household formation, mortgage rate levels and mortgage availability, certain tax benefits, job growth, increases in renters that qualify as homebuyers, the inherent attributes of homeownership versus renting and the availability of inventory in the consumer's desired location and within the consumer's price range. While the U.S. residential real estate market experienced significant declines in 2022 and third-parties, including Fannie Mae and NAR, forecast continued declines in 2023, we believe that the residential real estate market will benefit over the long-term from expected positive fundamentals, including expected growth in the number of U.S. households over the next decade, in particular among the millennial generation. A continuation of beneficial consumer and business trends that gained momentum during the COVID-19 crisis (such as preferences for certain geographies and the increasing ease and acceptance of remote work) may also have a positive impact on homesale transactions.
The U.S. residential housing market is also seasonal, with a higher level of homesale transactions typically occurring in the second and third quarter of each year. As a result, historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been stronger in the second and third quarters of the calendar year.
Participation in Multiple Aspects of Residential Real Estate
We participate in services associated with many aspects of the residential real estate market. Our complementary businesses and minority-held joint ventures, including our mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures, work together, allowing us to generate revenue at various points in a residential real estate transaction, including the purchase or sale of homes, corporate relocation and lead generation services, settlement and title services, and franchising of our brands. The businesses each benefit from our deep understanding of the industry, strong relationships 
with real estate brokers, sales agents and other real estate professionals and expertise across the transactional process. Unlike other industry participants who offer only one or two services, we can offer homeowners, our franchisees and our corporate and real estate benefit program clients ready access to numerous associated services that facilitate and simplify the home purchase and sale process. These services provide further revenue opportunities for our owned businesses and those of our franchisees. All of our businesses and our minority-owned joint ventures can derive revenue from the same real estate transaction.
Our Brands 
Our brands are among the most well-known and established real estate brokerage brands in the real estate industry.
Together with our strategic joint ventures, our brands allow us to leverage our strengths, while participating in multiple markets within the real estate industry. Specifically, while all of our brands compete to varying extents in the high-end markets, our Sotheby’s International Realty® and Corcoran® brands are particularly well-positioned to benefit from growth in high-end markets. Likewise, while all of our brands utilize offerings through Title Group, our company owned Coldwell Banker® brand shares deep synergies with our title business as well as our mortgage origination and title insurance underwriter joint ventures that allow us to progress towards our goal to integrate the residential real estate transaction. In addition, our global franchise brands including, Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate, CENTURY 21®, ERA®, and Sotheby’s International Realty® as well as franchised Coldwell Banker® brokerages, provide us with attractive scale and afford us the ability to offer versatility of choice to franchisees and consumers.
Our real estate brands are listed in the following chart, which includes information as of December 31, 2022, for both our franchised and company owned offices:

Anywhere Brands—Franchise Group
Overview—Franchise Business
Franchise Group is comprised of our franchise business as well as our lead generation and relocation services operations.
As of December 31, 2022, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 337,400 independent sales agents worldwide, including approximately 195,000 independent sales agents operating in the U.S. (which included approximately 59,800 company owned brokerage independent sales agents). As of December 31, 2022, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 20,500 offices worldwide in 119 countries and territories in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, including approximately 5,700 brokerage offices in the U.S. (which included approximately 680 company owned brokerage offices).
As shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2022, independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned brokerages grew by 6% (based on the Company’s internal data) and independent sales agents affiliated with our franchised brokerages declined by 4% (based on information provided by our affiliated franchisees), in each case as compared to December 31, 2021.
The average tenure among our U.S. franchisees is approximately 24 years as of December 31, 2022. Our franchisees pay us fees for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to enjoy the benefits of the systems and business enhancing tools provided by our real estate franchise operations. In addition to highly competitive brands that provide unique offerings to our franchisees, we support our franchisees with dedicated national marketing and servicing programs, technology, and learning and development to facilitate our franchisees in developing their business.
Our primary objectives as a franchisor of residential real estate brokerages are to retain and expand existing franchises, sell new franchises, and most importantly, provide branding and support (including via proprietary and third-party products and services) to our franchisees and their independent sales agents.
Operations—Franchising
We derive substantially all of our real estate franchising revenues from royalties and marketing fees received under long-term franchise agreements with our domestic franchisees and Owned Brokerage Group for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to utilize the benefits of the franchise systems. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales commission earned from closed homesale sides, which we refer to as gross commission income.
Franchise Group's domestic annual net royalty revenues from franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages at Owned Brokerage Group) can be represented by multiplying (1) that year's total number of closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction) in which those franchisees participated by (2) the average sale 
price of those homesales by (3) the average brokerage commission rate charged by these franchisees by (4) Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate. Franchise Group's net contractual royalty rate represents the average percentage of our franchisees' commission revenues paid to us as a royalty, net of volume incentives achieved, if applicable, and net of other incentives granted to franchisees.
In addition to domestic royalty revenue, Franchise Group earns revenue from marketing fees, the strategic alliance program, international affiliates and upfront international fees.
During 2022, none of our franchisees (other than Owned Brokerage Group) generated more than 3% of the total revenue of our real estate franchise business.
Our franchisees (other than our company owned brokerages at Owned Brokerage Group) are independent business operators and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations.
Domestic Franchisees. Franchise agreements set forth guidelines on the business and operations of the franchisees and require them to comply with the mandatory identity standards set forth in each brand's policy and procedures manuals. A franchisee's failure to comply with these restrictions and standards could result in a termination of the franchise agreement. The franchisees generally are not permitted to terminate the franchise agreements prior to their expiration, and in those cases where termination rights do exist, they are limited (e.g., if the franchisee retires, becomes disabled or dies). Generally, new domestic franchise agreements have a term of ten years.
These franchisee agreements generally require the franchisee to pay us an initial franchise fee for the franchisee's principal office plus a royalty fee that is a percentage of gross commission income, if any, earned by the franchisee. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways, and we have and may continue, from time to time, to introduce pilot programs or restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms.
Certain of our brands utilize a volume-based incentive model with a royalty fee rate that is initially equal to 6% of the franchisee's gross commission income, but subject to reduction based upon volume incentives. Under this model, the franchisee is eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the royalties paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The volume incentive is calculated for each eligible franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenue (paid timely) for each calendar year. The volume incentive varies for each franchise system. We provide a detailed table to each eligible franchisee that describes the gross revenue thresholds required to achieve a volume incentive and the corresponding incentive amounts. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the percentage and/or dollar amounts in the table on an annual basis, subject to certain limitations.
Certain franchisees (including some of our largest franchisees) have a flat percentage royalty fee. Under this model, franchisees pay a fixed percentage (generally less than 6%) of their commission income to us and the percentage does not change during the year or over the term of their franchise agreement. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.
Our Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate franchise business utilizes a capped fee model, which has applied to any new franchisee since 2019 as well as preexisting franchisees who elect to switch from their current royalty fee structure to the capped fee model. Under this model, franchisees pay a royalty fee (generally equal to 5% of their commission income) capped at a set amount per independent sales agent per year, subject to our right to annually modify or increase the independent sales agent cap. Franchisees on this model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.
Our Corcoran franchise business utilizes a tiered royalty fee model under which franchisees pay us a percentage of their gross commission income as a royalty fee. The royalty fee percentage is generally set at an initial rate of 6% and decreases in steps during each calendar year as the franchisee’s gross commission income reaches certain levels to a minimum of 4%. Similarly, our Coldwell Banker® residential franchise business began offering a tiered royalty fee model in 2021, under which the royalty fee percentage is generally set at an initial rate of 5.5% and decreases in steps during the calendar year as the franchisee’s gross commission income reaches certain levels to a minimum of 3%. Under this tiered royalty fee model, we reserve the right to annually modify or increase the gross commission income levels, subject to certain limitations. Franchisees on the tiered royalty fee model are generally not eligible for volume incentives.
Other incentives may be used as consideration to attract new franchisees, grow franchisees (including through independent sales agent recruitment) or extend existing franchise agreements. Under certain circumstances, we extend conversion notes or other note-backed funding to eligible franchisees for the purpose of providing an incentive to join the 
brand, to renew their franchise agreements, or to facilitate their growth opportunities. Growth opportunities include the expansion of franchisees' existing businesses by opening additional offices, through the consolidation of operations of other franchisees, as well as through the acquisition of independent sales agents and offices operated by independent brokerages. Franchisees may also use the proceeds from note-backed funding to update marketing materials or upgrade technology and websites. The notes are not funded until appropriate credit checks and other due diligence matters are completed, and the business is opened and operating under one of our brands. Upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance-based thresholds, the notes are forgiven ratably generally over the term of the franchise agreement. If the revenue performance thresholds are not met or the franchise agreement terminates, franchisees may be required to repay a portion of the outstanding notes.
Each of our current franchise systems require franchisees and company owned brokerages to make monthly contributions to marketing funds maintained by each brand in accordance with the applicable franchise agreement. These contributions are used primarily for the development, implementation, production, placement and payment of national and regional advertising, marketing, promotions, public relations, broker and agent marketing tools and products and/or other marketing-related activities, such as lead generation, all to promote and further the recognition of each brand and its independent franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents. In addition to the contributions from franchisees and company owned offices, in certain instances, Franchise Group may be required to make contributions to certain marketing funds and may make discretionary contributions (at its option) to any of the marketing funds.
In addition to offices owned and operated by our third-party franchisees, as of December 31, 2022, we, through Owned Brokerage Group, own and operate approximately 680 offices under the Coldwell Banker®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® brand names. The domestic royalty revenue from Owned Brokerage Group is calculated by multiplying homesale sides by average sale price by average brokerage commission rate by their contractual royalty rate. Owned Brokerage Group pays intercompany royalty fees of approximately 6% and marketing fees to Franchise Group in connection with its operation of these offices. These fees are recognized as income or expense by the applicable segment level and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses. Owned Brokerage Group does not participate in volume incentive or other incentive programs.
International Third-Party Franchisees. In the U.S., we employ a direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide services directly to independent owner-operators. We also utilize a direct franchising model outside of the U.S. for Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® and, in some cases, Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. For all other brands, we generally employ a master franchise model outside of the U.S., whereby we contract with a qualified third party to build a franchise network in the country or region in which franchising rights have been granted. Under both the direct and master franchise models outside of the U.S., we typically enter into long-term franchise agreements (often 25 years in duration) and receive an initial area development fee and ongoing royalties. Under the master franchise model, the ongoing royalties we receive are generally a percentage of the royalties received by the master franchisor from its franchisees with which it contracts. Under the direct franchise model, a royalty fee is paid to us on transactions conducted by our franchisees in the applicable country or region.
Intellectual Property
We own the trademarks Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Corcoran®, ERA® and related trademarks and logos, and such trademarks and logos are material to the businesses that are part of our real estate franchise segment. Our franchisees and our subsidiaries actively use these trademarks, and all of the material trademarks are registered (or have applications pending) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with corresponding trademark offices in major countries worldwide where these businesses have significant franchised operations.
We have an exclusive license to own, operate and franchise the Sotheby's International Realty® brand to qualified residential real estate brokerage offices and individuals operating in eligible markets pursuant to a license agreement with SPTC Delaware LLC, a subsidiary of Sotheby's ("Sotheby's"). Such license agreement has a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term ending February 16, 2054 and a 50-year renewal option. We pay a licensing fee to Sotheby's for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® name equal to 9.5% of the net royalties earned by Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, including our company owned offices. Our license agreement is terminable by Sotheby's prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, (3) a court issues a non-appealable, final judgment that we have committed certain breaches of the license agreement and we fail to cure such breaches within 60 days of the 
issuance of such judgment, or (4) we discontinue the use of all of the trademarks licensed under the license agreement for a period of twelve consecutive months.
In October 2007, we entered into a long-term license agreement to own, operate and franchise the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand from Meredith Operations Corporation, successor in interest to Meredith Corporation ("Meredith Ops"). The license agreement between Anywhere and Meredith Ops is for a 50-year term, with a renewal option for another 50 years at our option. We pay a licensing fee to Meredith Ops for the use of the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand name equal to 9.0% of the net royalties earned by Franchise Group attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand, subject to a minimum annual licensing fee. Our license agreement is terminable by Meredith Ops prior to the end of the license term if certain conditions occur, including but not limited to the following: (1) we attempt to assign any of our rights under the license agreement in any manner not permitted under the license agreement, (2) we become bankrupt or insolvent, or (3) a trial court issues a final judgment that we are in material breach of the license agreement or any representation or warranty we made was false or materially misleading when made.
Operations—Other
Lead Generation. Through Leads Group, a part of Franchise Group, we seek to provide high-quality leads to independent sales agents, including through real estate benefit programs that provide home-buying and selling assistance to customers of lenders, members of organizations such as credit unions and interest groups that have established members who are buying or selling a home as well as to consumers and corporations who have expressed interest in a certain brand, product or service (such as relocation services), including those offered by Anywhere. Where permitted by law, consumers participating in certain real estate benefit programs can receive a financial benefit for using these services (such as cash or a gift card, or real estate brokerage commission credit based on the home purchase/sale price pursuant to the applicable program). Leads Group also manages its own broker-to-broker business, pursuant to which brokers affiliated with one of its customized agent and brokerage networks refer business to other in-network brokers.
Our real estate benefit program revenues are highly concentrated, with one client-directed real estate benefit program contributing a substantial majority of the high-quality leads generated through our lead generation programs, and our client-directed programs are non-exclusive and terminable at any time at the option of the client. We also maintain Company-driven real estate benefit programs and additional leads may be generated via other strategic initiatives, including through consumer-focused products and services we may develop or offer. We expect that significant time and effort and meaningful investment will be required to increase awareness of, and participation in, programs, partnerships or products and services that are intended to aid in lead generation.
To service the needs of consumers and clients participating in one of our real estate benefit programs (including our relocation program with Cartus) or engaged through a broker-to-broker lead, we manage customized agent and brokerage networks. Our networks consist of real estate brokers, including our company owned brokerage operations, as well as franchisees and independent real estate brokers who have been approved to become members of one or more networks. Member brokers of our networks receive leads from our real estate benefit programs (including via our relocation program with Cartus) and each other in exchange for a commission split paid to Leads Group.
Cartus® Relocation Services. Cartus, a provider of global relocation services, offers a broad range of world-class employee relocation services designed to manage all aspects of an employee's move to facilitate a smooth transition in what otherwise may be a complex and difficult process for employee and employer. The wide range of services we offer allow our clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us. Our broad array of services include, but are not limited to homesale assistance, relocation policy counseling and group move management services, expense processing and relocation-related accounting, and visa and immigration support. We also arrange household goods moving services and provide support for all aspects of moving a transferee's household goods.
We primarily offer corporate clients employee relocation services, including 40% of the Fortune 50 companies in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the top 25 relocation clients had an average tenure of approximately 23 years with us. Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients are terminable at any time at the option of the client and are non-exclusive. If a client ceases or reduces volume under its contract, we will be compensated for all services performed up to the time that volume ceases and reimbursed for all expenses incurred.
There are a number of different revenue streams associated with relocation services. We earn a commission from real estate brokers and household goods moving companies that provide services to the transferee. Clients may also pay transactional fees for the services performed. Furthermore, Cartus continues to provide value through the generation of leads 
to real estate agent and brokerage participants in the networks maintained by Leads Group, which drives downstream revenue for our businesses.
Strategic Alliance Program. We offer third-party service providers an opportunity to market their products to our franchisees and their independent sales agents and customers through our strategic alliance program. To participate in this program, service providers generally agree to provide preferred pricing to our franchisees and/or their customers or independent sales agents and to pay us an initial access fee, subsequent marketing fees and/or commissions based upon our franchisees' or independent sales agents' usage of the strategic alliance vendors.
Anywhere Advisors—Owned Brokerage Group 
Overview
Through Owned Brokerage Group we own and operate a full-service real estate brokerage business in many of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our brokerage offices are geographically diverse with a strong presence in the east and west coast areas, primarily around large metropolitan areas in the U.S., where home prices are generally higher. Our company owned real estate brokerage business operates under the Coldwell Banker®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® franchised brands. This segment also includes our share of equity earnings or losses from our minority-owned real estate auction joint venture and our former RealSure joint venture.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 680 company owned brokerage offices and approximately 59,800 independent sales agents working with these company owned offices. Of those offices, we operated approximately 89% of our offices under the Coldwell Banker® brand name, approximately 7% of our offices under the Sotheby's International Realty® brand name and 4% of our offices under the Corcoran® brand name.
We intend to continue to seek to increase the productivity of company owned brokerage offices, including by optimizing efficiencies and reducing redundancies. We will continue to work with office managers to attract and retain independent sales agents who can successfully engage and promote transactions from new and existing clients. From time to time, we may also execute strategic acquisitions. Following the completion of an acquisition, we tend to consolidate the newly acquired operations with our existing operations to reduce or eliminate duplicative costs and to leverage our existing infrastructure to support newly affiliated independent sales agents.
Operations—Brokerage
Our company owned real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from gross commission income received serving as the broker at the closing of real estate transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our average homesale broker commission rate was 2.40%, which represents the average commission rate earned on either the "buy" side or the "sell" side of a homesale transaction. Gross commission income is also earned on non-sale transactions such as home rentals. Owned Brokerage Group, as a franchisee of Franchise Group, pays marketing fees and a royalty fee of approximately 6% of the gross commission income earned per real estate transaction to Franchise Group; however, such amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Owned Brokerage Group paid marketing fees and royalties to Franchise Group of $373 million and $407 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The remainder of gross commission income is split between the broker (Owned Brokerage Group) and the independent sales agent in accordance with their applicable independent contractor agreement (which specifies the portion of the broker commission to be paid to the agent), which varies by agent.
In addition, as a full-service real estate brokerage company, we promote the complementary services offered through our other segments, including title, escrow and settlement, mortgage origination and relocation services. We believe we provide integrated services that enhance the customer experience.
When we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally provide the seller with a full-service marketing program, which may include developing a direct marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple listing services, advertising the property (including on websites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally help the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the buyer's personal and financial specifications, show properties to the buyer, assist the buyer in negotiating (where permissible) and preparing for closing the transaction. In 
addition, Owned Brokerage Group has relationships with developers in select major cities (in particular New York City) to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments.
Operations—Joint Ventures
Our share of equity earnings or losses from our 50% interest in our real estate auction joint venture with Sotheby's and our 49% interest in our former RealSure joint venture with Home Partners of America are included in Owned Brokerage Group. The joint venture with Sotheby's, formed in 2021, holds an 80% ownership stake in Concierge Auctions, a global luxury real estate auction marketplace that partners with real estate agents to host luxury online auctions for clients. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company and Home Partners of America agreed to cease operations of the RealSure joint venture. While we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest in these non-exclusive joint ventures.
Anywhere Integrated Services—Title Group
Overview 
Title Group is comprised of our title agency business that conducts title, escrow and settlement services and also includes the Company' share of equity earnings and losses from certain non-exclusive joint ventures, including, among others, Guaranteed Rate Affinity (a mortgage origination joint venture) and the title insurance underwriter joint venture (see below under the header "Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture" for additional information). Our equity earnings or losses related to minority-owned joint ventures such as Guaranteed Rate Affinity and the title insurance underwriter joint venture are included in the financial results of Title Group but are not reported as revenue to Title Group. 
Our title agency business provides title search, examination, clearance and policy issuance services and conducts the closing process and funds disbursement for lenders, real estate agents, attorneys and homebuilders and their customers on purchase transactions and lenders and their customers on refinance transactions. 
We intend to grow our title, escrow and settlement services business by recruiting successful title and escrow sales personnel in existing markets. We will also seek to increase our capture rate of title business from Owned Brokerage Group homesale sides.
Operations
Title Agency, or Title, Escrow and Settlement Services. We are licensed as a title agent in 44 states and Washington, D.C., and have physical locations in 25 states and Washington, D.C. We operate mostly in major metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 383 offices, approximately 151 of which are co-located within one of our company owned brokerage offices. In addition to our own title, escrow and settlement services, we also coordinate a nationwide network of attorneys, title agents and notaries to service financial institution clients on a national basis.
Our title, escrow and settlement services business provides full-service title, escrow and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to consumers, real estate companies, corporations and financial institutions with many of these services provided in connection with the Company's real estate brokerage and relocation services businesses. We provide closing and escrow services relating to the closing of home purchases and refinancing of home loans. For refinance transactions, we generate title and escrow revenues from financial institutions and loan officers throughout the mortgage lending industry. 
Our company owned brokerage operations are the principal source of our title, escrow and settlement services business for homesale transactions. Many of our offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. In 2022, our title, escrow and settlement business was involved in approximately 152,000 transactions of which approximately 48,000 related to Owned Brokerage Group. The capture rate of our title, escrow and settlement services business from buyers or sellers represented by our company owned brokerages was approximately 31% in 2022. Other sources of our title, escrow and settlement services homesale business include Franchise Group, Leads Group, home builders and unaffiliated brokerage operations.
Virtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real property. The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be insured are determined in accordance with the standard policies and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies sell title insurance, the title search may be performed by the title agent, an underwriter or contracted to a third party while the examination function is always performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split the premium. The amount of such premium "split" is generally determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter and, in some states, is promulgated by state law. We derive 
revenue through fees charged in real estate transactions for rendering the services described above, fees charged for escrow and closing services, and a percentage of the title premium on each title insurance policy sold.
We have entered into underwriting agreements with various underwriters, which state the conditions under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their behalf. For policies issued through our agency operations, assuming no negligence on our part, we are not typically liable for losses under those policies; rather the title insurer is typically liable for such losses.
Other Revenue. Other revenue generated by our title agency business includes closing protection letters, title searches, survey business, tax search, wire fees, and other fees ancillary to their services.
Joint Ventures. 
Mortgage Origination. Guaranteed Rate Affinity, our mortgage origination joint venture with Guaranteed Rate, Inc. ("Guaranteed Rate") began doing business in August 2017. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates mortgage loans, including both purchase and refinancing transactions, to be sold in the secondary market. Guaranteed Rate Affinity originates and markets its mortgage lending services to real estate agents across the country (including to independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned and franchised brokerages) and relocation companies (including our relocation operations) as well as a broad consumer audience. 
Many of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s offices have subleased space from and are co-located within our company owned brokerage offices. Our company owned brokerage operations represented approximately half of purchase transactions, as well as approximately half of Guaranteed Rate Affinity’s mortgage origination business for the year-ended December 31, 2022.
Under the Operating Agreement (the "GRA Agreement") between a subsidiary of Title Group and a subsidiary of Guaranteed Rate (the "GRA Member"), we own 49.9% of the home mortgage joint venture and Guaranteed Rate indirectly owns the remaining 50.1%. Under the GRA Agreement, Guaranteed Rate Affinity is to distribute to each of the Company and Guaranteed Rate the distributable net income based on each member's ownership interest percentage following the close of each quarter. While we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest in the joint venture. Guaranteed Rate Affinity is licensed to conduct mortgage operations in 49 states and Washington, D.C.
The GRA Agreement is for an initial 10-year term (ending August 2027) and automatically renews for additional 5-year terms, unless either party provides advance notice to terminate, provided that if certain performance metrics are achieved after the fifth year of the agreement, the first 5-year extension is not subject to termination upon advance notice. Either party can terminate the GRA Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events including, but not limited to, a change in control of the other member, subject to certain exceptions, or upon material breach by the other member not remediated within the cure period. We have certain additional performance-based termination rights.
The GRA Agreement does not prohibit Guaranteed Rate, directly or indirectly through joint ventures with other parties, from operating its separate mortgage origination business and does not limit the Company, Guaranteed Rate, or either of their subsidiaries from operating non-mortgage origination lines of business in locations where Guaranteed Rate Affinity operates. In addition, the Company is permitted to have ventures with other mortgage loan originators, but Guaranteed Rate has a 30-day right-of-first-refusal to acquire any mortgage origination business that we intend to acquire.
Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture. In March 2022, the Company sold its title insurance underwriter, Title Resources Guaranty Company (the "Title Underwriter") (previously reported in the Title Group reportable segment) in exchange for cash and a minority equity stake in the form of common units in a title insurance underwriter joint venture that owns the Title Underwriter (the "Title Insurance Underwriter Joint Venture"). Other joint venture partners own a majority equity stake in the joint venture in the form of preferred units that carry liquidation preference rights. While we have certain governance rights, we do not have a controlling financial or operating interest in the joint venture.
Products, Technology and Marketing 
Products and Technology—Agents. Our ability to provide independent sales agents at company owned and franchised brokerages with compelling data and technology-powered products and services to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable is core to our integrated business strategy.
The marketing and technology services and support provided by independent sales agents to their customers are an important element of the value offered by an agent in the home purchase and sale process. Our commitment to continuously 
develop and improve our marketing and technology-powered products and services is part of our value proposition to company owned and franchised real estate brokerages, affiliated independent sales agents and their customers as well as to our other businesses. Increasingly, these products and services are desired as an integrated set of tools, rather than stand-alone products and services.
We continue to develop product and marketing capabilities designed to support the continuous creation and delivery of both our proprietary tools and third-party products to affiliated independent sales agents in order to deliver a more comprehensive platform experience. Through this strategy, we are able to selectively enable qualified third-party vendors and products to access and interface with our products and services so that affiliated independent sales agents will be able to build their own configurable technology platform to drive their performance and productivity. 
Our technology platform is designed to offer affiliated independent sales agents and brokers seamless access to third-party products, enabling choice among such agents and brokers to leverage the mix of tools that best serve their needs. In 2021 we began rolling out the MoxiWorks® product suite to company owned and franchised brokerages and their affiliated independent sales agents. The MoxiWorks® product suite includes solutions for business productivity, marketing, recruiting and agent and broker websites and leverages our technology platform to provide an integrated experience including with our proprietary leads engine that enables lead routing to affiliated independent sales agents.
We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop or procure marketing, technology and service offerings to meet the needs of affiliated independent sales agents. 
Our Anywhere-provided platform is designed to increase the value proposition to our independent sales agents, franchisees (and their independent sales agents) and consumers by:
•aiding in lead generation and obtaining additional homesale transactions;
•connecting affiliated agents and brokers to a CRM tool that allows for the cultivation of productive relationships with consumers at all stages of the transaction;
•enhancing access to listing distributions through mobile applications and websites; 
•informing affiliated agents of valuable client insight to help those agents increase their productivity;
•providing consumers with a streamlined yet comprehensive user experience to facilitate the necessary steps for researching homes, communities and independent sales agents;
•providing key back-office processes, including listing and transaction management, reporting, marketing, and agent profiles; and
•delivering business planning tools that enable our franchisees to track their progress against key business objectives in real time.
The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for, and adoption of, digital and virtual products and services that facilitate a remote home buying and selling experience. Our brands and businesses have access to a range of tools to assist consumers with virtual staging, virtual open houses, and remote online notarization for title, escrow and settlement closings.
Products and Technology—Consumers. In 2022, we announced our intention to focus on the consumer experience as well, seeking to improve the experience of buying and selling a home by creating an easier and integrated experience for all parts of a consumer's transaction. We expect to continue to invest in the development and/or procurement of products and technology designed to deliver valuable capabilities via digital channels throughout the lifecycle of home ownership.
Marketing. Each of our brands manages a comprehensive system of marketing tools that can be accessed through freestanding brand intranet sites to assist our company owned brokerages and affiliated franchisees and their respective independent sales agents in becoming the best marketer of their listings. Advertising is primarily used by the brands to drive leads to affiliated agents, increase brand awareness and perception, promote our network and offerings to the real estate industry and engage our customer base.
Each of our franchise brands operates a marketing fund that is funded principally by our franchisees (including company owned offices), although we may make discretionary contributions to any of the marketing funds and in certain instances are required to make contributions to certain marketing funds.
Likewise, our company owned brokerages sponsor a wide array of marketing programs, materials and opportunities to complement the sales work of our affiliated independent sales agents and increase brand awareness. The effectiveness and quality of marketing programs play a significant role in attracting and retaining independent sales agents.
Our marketing programs, tools and initiatives primarily focus on attracting potential new home buyers and sellers to our company owned brokerages and affiliated franchisees and their respective affiliated independent sales agents by:
•showcasing the inventory of our real estate listings and the affiliated independent sales agents who are the listing agents of these properties;
•building and maintaining brand awareness and preference for the brand; and
•increasing the local recognition of affiliated agents and brokerages.
Marketing programs are executed using a variety of media including, but not limited to social media, advertising, direct marketing and internet advertising. 
Listings and Websites. The internet is the primary advertising channel in our industry and we have sought to become a leader among full-service residential real estate brokerage firms in the use and application of marketing technology. We transmit listings to various platforms and services, place our property listings on hundreds of real estate websites, and operate a variety of our own websites. We place significant emphasis on distributing our real estate listings with third-party websites to expand a homebuyer's access to such listings, at times enhancing the presentation of the listings on third-party websites to make the listings more attractive to consumers.
Our brand websites contain listing information on a regional and national market basis, independent sales agent information, community profiles, home buying and selling advice, relocation tips and mortgage financing information and unique property and neighborhood insights from local agents. Additionally, each brand website allows independent sales agents to market themselves to consumers. 
Education
Each real estate brand provides franchisees access to learning, development, and continuing education materials for use in connection with their real estate sales businesses. Use of such materials by affiliated brokers and independent sales agents is voluntary and discretionary. Independent sales agents affiliated with a company owned brokerage must complete compliance training related to fair housing (in addition to their state licensing fair housing obligations). 
Human Capital Resources
Employees. Our employees are critical to the success of our business strategy. Our team includes a broad range of professionals, given the breadth of services offered by our three business segments and Corporate. The wide array of skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefits our operations and performance.
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 8,890 full-time employees and 135 part-time employees. At December 31, 2022, approximately 685 of our employees were located outside of the U.S., almost all of whom were employed by Cartus (a part of Anywhere Brands).
None of our employees are represented by a union. Employment relationships in Brazil (where we had less than 10 employees at December 31, 2022) are governed by rules set forth under collective bargaining agreements. 
Engagement. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we annually survey employees with the assistance of third-party consultants and implement actions to address areas of employee feedback. In 2022, we achieved an 88% engagement score and an 86% response rate.
Training. All employees are required to participate in annual training programs designed to address subjects of key importance to our business, including the Company’s Code of Ethics. Nearly 100% of active employees in each of the past three years have completed our annual Code of Ethics training. Code of Ethics training in 2022 covered topics such as promoting an ethical culture, reporting conflicts of interest, and compliance with RESPA. Other mandatory training in 2022 included Global Information Security and a course on valuing diversity, given the critical nature of these topics to our business. Biennially, employees are also required to complete a training module focused on the U.S. Fair Housing Act. In 2022, all people managers were also required to complete a training module on unconscious bias. The U.S. Fair Housing Act online module, as well as in-person training sessions related to local fair housing laws, are also made available to 
independent sales agents affiliated with our company owned and franchise brokerages. We have also made our Fair Housing training available on a customized basis to diversity industry partners, including the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, Asian Real Estate Association of America, National Association of Minority Mortgage Professionals, and LGBTQ+ Real Estate Alliance. Additional mandatory training (such as sexual harassment training) is delivered based upon the employee position or local requirements. Our learning and development platform offers employees additional resources to continue to grow professionally, including access to on-demand training through LinkedIn learning and tools for career management.
Health & Safety. The protection of the health and safety of our employees is a Company priority. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis we have worked to comply with state and local regulators to ensure safe working conditions for our employees. In 2022, we completed the transformation of our corporate headquarters to an open-plan innovation hub, which streamlined our headquarters footprint to a single floor designed to welcome approximately 200 transitional employees each day, instead of the approximately 1,000 employees designated to static spaces in the traditional office. At December 31, 2022, approximately half of our employees worked remotely on a full-time basis, other employees, in particular consumer-facing employees at our company-owned brokerages, were operating in an office-based environment, while other employees remained on a hybrid model. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 crisis and are prepared to pivot as needed for the health and safety of our employees.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Since our inception, Anywhere has had a focus on diversity to improve representation and foster inclusion through employee and business resource groups across the enterprise. Employee Resources Groups (“ERGs”) promote an inclusive culture throughout the organization. At December 31, 2022, we had eight active ERGs—Asian and Pacific Islander Alliance, ACE (African-American and Caribbean), ONEVOZ (Hispanic & Latino), NextGen, REALDisabilities, RealPride, SERVICE (Veterans) and Women's—across the Company. Improving ethnic and racial representation remains a priority and a key performance objective for senior leadership.
Independent Sales Agents. As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, the successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams are critical to the business and financial results of our company owned brokerage operations. Additional information about the base of independent sales agents affiliated with company owned brokerages as well as franchisees is located in this Item 1. under "Anywhere Brands—Overview."
Competition
Real Estate Brokerage Industry. The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees and our company-owned brokerage businesses to successfully compete is important to our prospects for growth. Their ability to compete may be affected by the recruitment, retention and performance of independent sales agents, the economic relationship between the broker and the agent (including the share of commission income retained by the agent and fees charged to or paid by the agent for services provided by the broker), consumer preferences, the location of offices and target markets, the services provided to independent sales agents, affiliation with a recognized brand name, community reputation, technology and other factors, including macro-economic factors such as national, regional and local economic conditions. In addition, the legal and regulatory environment as well as the rules of NAR, industry associations and MLSs can impact competition. See "Government and Other Regulations" below.
We and affiliated franchisees compete for consumer business as well as for independent sales agents with national and regional independent real estate brokerages and franchisors, discount and limited service brokerages, non-traditional market participants, and with franchisees of our brands. Our largest national competitors in this industry include, but are not limited to, HomeServices of America (a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate), Howard Hanna Holdings, EXP Realty (a subsidiary of eXp World Holdings, Inc.), Compass, Inc., Redfin Corporation, Weichert, Realtors and @properties as well as several large franchisors, including RE/MAX International, Inc., Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and HSF Affiliates LLC (operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Real Living Real Estate). We and affiliated franchisees also compete with leading listing aggregators, such as Zillow, Inc. and Realtor.com® (a listing aggregator held by News Corp.) as well as CoStar Group, Inc. In addition, we and affiliated franchisees compete for consumer business with newer industry participants, including iBuying models such as Opendoor and Offerpad.
Competition for Independent Sales Agents. The successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams is critical to the business and financial results of traditional brokerages—whether or not they are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition for productive independent sales agents in our industry is high and competition is most intense for highly productive independent sales agents with strong reputations in their respective communities.
Most of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of its independent sales agents, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated and other company-generated leads. Many factors impact recruitment and retention efforts, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales agents), other expenses borne by independent sales agents, leads or business opportunities generated for independent sales agents from the brokerage, independent sales agents' perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, technology and data offerings as well as marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage or franchisor, the quality of the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales agents with whom they collaborate daily, the location and quality of office space, as well as continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage or franchisor. 
We believe that a variety of factors in recent years have negatively impacted the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents in the industry generally and have increasingly impacted our recruitment and retention of top producing agents and put upward pressure on the average share of commissions paid to affiliated independent sales agents. Such factors include increasing competition, increasing levels of commissions paid to agents (including up-front payments and equity), changes in the spending patterns of independent sales agents (as more agents purchase services from third parties outside of their affiliated broker), a heightening focus on leads or business opportunities generated for the independent sales agent from the brokerage, differentiation in the bundling of agent services or industry offerings (including virtual brokerages or other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income, or other compensation, such as sign-on or equity awards), and the growth in independent sales agent teams. Competition comes from newer models as well, including brokerages that provide certain services to agents and agent teams, but with branding focused on the name of the agent or agent team, rather than the brokerage brand.
Commission Plan Competition Among Real Estate Brokerages. Some of the firms competing for sales agents use different commission plans, which may be appealing to certain sales agents. There are several different commission plan variations that have been historically utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales agents. One of the most common variations has been the traditional graduated commission model where the independent sales agent receives a percentage of the brokerage commission that increases as the independent sales agent increases his or her volume of homesale transactions, and the brokerage frequently provides independent sales agents with a broad set of support offerings and promotion of properties. Other common plans include a desk rental (sometimes referred to as a 100% commission plan), a fixed transaction fee commission plan, and a capped commission plan. A capped commission plan generally blends aspects of the traditional graduated commission model with the 100% commission plan. Although less common, some real estate brokerages employ their sales agents and in such instances, employee agents may earn smaller brokerage commissions in exchange for other employee benefits or bonuses. Most brokerages focus primarily on one type of commission plan, though some may offer one or more of commission plan variations to their sales agents.
In many of their markets, Owned Brokerage Group offers a traditional graduated commission model, which emphasizes our value proposition. The traditional graduated commission model has experienced declines in market share over the past several years. Increasingly, independent sales agents have affiliated with brokerages that offer a different mix of services to the agent, allowing the independent sales agent to select the services that they believe allow them to retain a greater percentage of the commission and purchase services from other vendors as needed. 
Low Barriers to Entry. The real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants, including participants utilizing historical real estate brokerage models and those pursuing alternative variations of those models (including virtual brokerages and brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income) as well as non-traditional methods of marketing real estate (such as iBuyers). There are also market participants who differentiate themselves by offering consumers flat fees, rebates or lower commission rates on transactions (often coupled with fewer services). The significant size of the U.S. real estate market has continued to attract outside capital investment in disruptive and traditional competitors that seek to access a portion of this market. These competitors and their investors may pursue increases in market share over profitability, further complicating the competitive landscape. 
Non-Traditional Competition and Industry Disruption. While real estate brokers using historical real estate brokerage models typically compete for business primarily on the basis of services offered, brokerage commission, reputation, utilization of technology and personal contacts, participants pursuing non-traditional methods of marketing real estate may compete in other ways, including companies that employ technologies intended to disrupt historical real estate brokerage models or minimize or eliminate the role brokers and sales agents perform in the homesale transaction process and/or shift the nature of the residential real estate transaction from the historic consumer-to-consumer model to a corporate-to-consumer model.
A growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions. For example, virtual brokerage and other brokerages that offer the sales agent fewer services, but a higher percentage of commission income (or other compensation, such as sign-on or equity awards), directly compete with traditional brokerage models and may dilute the relationship between the brokerage and the agent and add additional competitive pressure for independent sales agent talent. We believe certain alternative transaction models, such as iBuying and home swap models (and related models that help buyers compete as cash buyers), charge significant fees to purchase homes and are less reliant on brokerages and sales agents, which could have a negative impact on such brokerages and agents as well as on the average homesale broker commission rate. These models also look to capture ancillary real estate services such as title and mortgage services and referral fees. Changes to industry rules and/or the introduction of disruptive products and services may also result in an increase in the number of transactions that do not utilize the services of independent sales agents, including for sale by owner transactions. 
In addition, the concentration and market power of the top listing aggregators allow them to monetize their platforms by a variety of actions including, but not limited to, setting up competing brokerages and/or expanding their offerings to include products (such as agent tools) and services that are a part of or ancillary to the real estate transaction, such as title, escrow and mortgage origination services, that compete with services offered by us, charging significant referral, listing and display fees, diluting the relationship between agents and brokers and between agents and the consumer, tying referrals to use of their products, consolidating and leveraging data, and engaging in preferential or exclusionary practices to favor or disfavor other industry participants. These actions divert and reduce the earnings of other industry participants, including our company owned and franchised brokerages. Aggregators could intensify their current business tactics or introduce new programs that could be materially disadvantageous to our business and other brokerage participants in the industry and such tactics could further increase pressures on the profitability of our company owned and franchised brokerages and affiliated independent sales agents, reduce our franchisor service revenue and dilute our relationships with affiliated franchisees and such franchisees' relationships with affiliated independent sales agents and buyers and sellers of homes. 
Franchise Competition. According to NAR, approximately 41% of individual brokers and independent sales agents are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is intense. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value that the franchisor provides to enhance the franchisee's ability to grow its business and improve the recruitment, retention and productivity of its independent sales agents. The value provided by a franchisor encompasses many different aspects including the quality of the brand, tools, technology, marketing and other services, the availability of financing provided to the franchisees, and the fees the franchisees must pay. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways and can include volume and other incentives, flat royalty and marketing fees, capped royalty fees, and discounted royalty and marketing fees. Taking into account competitive factors, we have and may continue, from time to time, to introduce pilot programs or restructure or revise the model used at one or more franchised brands, including with respect to fee structures, minimum production requirements or other terms.
Lead Generation Business. The ability of a brokerage, whether company owned or franchised, to provide its independent sales agents with high-quality leads is increasingly important to the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and sales agent teams and the attraction and retention of franchisees. Numerous companies that market and sell residential real estate leads to independent sales agents, including listing aggregators, compete with our real estate benefit programs and other lead generation programs.
Relocation Operations. Competition in our corporate relocation operations is based on capabilities, price and quality. We compete primarily with global outsourced and regional relocation services providers in the corporate relocation operations. The larger outsourced relocation services providers that we compete with include SIRVA BGRS Worldwide, Inc., Weichert Relocation Resources, Inc., Aires and Graebel Companies, Inc. Competition is expected to continue to intensify as an increasingly higher percentage of relocation clients reduce their global relocation benefits and related spend.
Title Agency Business. The title, escrow and settlement services business is highly competitive and fragmented. The number and size of competing companies vary in the different areas in which we conduct business. In certain parts of the country our title agency business competes with small title agents and attorneys while in other parts of the country our competition is the larger title underwriters and national vendor management companies. 
Integrated Services and Ancillary Services. Increasingly residential real estate market participants have sought to establish more integrated business models that include the provision of ancillary services to the consumer, such as title agency, mortgage origination and underwriting. Similarly, certain mortgage origination providers seek to broaden their access to the profit pools surrounding the residential real estate transaction, including real estate brokerage commissions. 
Some mortgage companies have created their own agent networks and may expand further into real estate. These factors have resulted in additional competitive pressure to our individual business units as well as the Company as a whole.
For additional information on the competitive risks facing our businesses, see "Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Strategic & Operational Risks", in particular under the caption "The businesses in which we, our joint ventures, and our franchisees operate are intensely competitive."
Government and Other Regulations 
See Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies", to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on the Company's legal proceedings. For additional information with respect to related risks facing our business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors," in particular under the heading "Regulatory and Legal Risks", in this Annual Report.
Legal and Regulatory Environment. All of our businesses, as well as the businesses of our joint ventures (such as mortgage origination, title insurance underwriting, and real estate auction) and the businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and subject to shifts in public policy, statutory interpretation and enforcement priorities of regulators and other government authorities as well as amendments to existing regulations and regulatory guidance. Likewise, litigation, investigations, claims and regulatory proceedings against us or other participants in the residential real estate industry or relocation industry—or against companies in other industries—may impact the Company and its affiliated franchisees when the rulings or settlements in those cases cover practices common to the broader industry or business community and may generate litigation or investigations for the Company. In addition, through our subsidiaries, employees and/or affiliated agents, we are a participant in many multiple listing services ("MLSs") and a member-owner of certain non-NAR controlled MLSs. Our affiliated agents may be members of the National Association of Realtors ("NAR") and respective state realtor associations. The rules and policies for these organizations are also subject to change due to shifts in internal policy, regulatory developments, litigation or other legal action. Changes in the rules and policies of NAR and/or any MLSs can also be driven by changes in membership, including the entry of new industry participants, and other industry forces.
From time to time, certain industry practices have come under federal or state scrutiny or have been the subject of litigation. The industry is currently experiencing increased scrutiny by regulators and other government offices, both on a federal and state level. Four of the more active areas of in our industry have been antitrust and competition, compliance with RESPA (and similar state statutes), compliance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA") (and similar state statutes) and worker classification. Other examples include, but are not limited to, consumer protection, mortgage lending and debt collection laws, federal and state fair housing laws, various broker fiduciary duties, false or fraudulent claims laws, and state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates and gifts to consumers.
Antitrust, Competition and Bribery Laws. Our business is subject to antitrust and competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Act and related federal and state antitrust and competition laws in the U.S. The penalties for violating antitrust and competition laws can be severe. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, dividing markets, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. 
In July 2021, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a notice of withdrawal of consent to its November 2020 proposed consent decree with NAR to settle a civil lawsuit in which the DOJ alleged that NAR established and enforced illegal restraints on competition in the real estate industry. The DOJ also filed to voluntarily dismiss the civil lawsuit without prejudice in July 2021, stating in a concurrently filed press release that “[t]he department determined that the [November 2020] settlement will not adequately protect the department’s rights to investigate other conduct by NAR that could impact competition in the real estate market…” The DOJ further noted in its press release that it “is taking this action to permit a broader investigation of NAR’s rules and conduct to proceed without restriction.” In connection with the foregoing, the DOJ issued a new and comprehensive civil investigative demand, or CID, that renewed demands related to the prior investigation, and also sought new categories of materials. In January 2023, the U.S. District Court for the D.C. District granted NAR's petition to set aside the new CID. Although we were not a party to or a participant in the DOJ’s civil lawsuit against, or settlement agreement with, NAR, and may not agree with certain of the allegations asserted, we do believe the settlement provisions generally were reasonable and would modernize the practices at issue. In November 2021, NAR modified its rules to implement most of the changes the DOJ settlement sought, and we (through our subsidiaries, employees and/or affiliated agents) will follow the new practices that are a result of NAR's rule changes.
In addition to the announcements by the DOJ, statements and actions by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the executive branch have been focused on increasing competition enforcement across industries. For example, an Executive 
Order issued by the White House in July 2021 identified areas of interest for further investigation—including real estate brokerage and listings. In January 2023, the FTC proposed a rule that, if enacted, would prohibit employers from entering into non-compete clauses with workers and require employers to rescind existing non-complete clauses. Additional action has been taken by the FTC, including its rescission of its generally applicable 2015 antitrust enforcement principles policy statement in July 2021 and its withdrawal of the 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines in September 2021.
In 2018, the DOJ and FTC held a joint public workshop to explore competition issues in the residential real estate services industry at which a variety of issues, beyond those alleged in the DOJ's November 2020 civil lawsuit against NAR, were raised that could be alleged or determined in the future to be anti-competitive.
Our international business activities, and in particular our relocation operations, must comply with applicable laws and regulations that impose sanctions on improper payments, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of other countries. 
RESPA. RESPA, state real estate brokerage laws, state title insurance laws, and similar laws in countries in which we do business restrict payments which real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance, home warranty and title insurance). Such laws may to some extent impose limitations on arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, title agency, lead generation, and relocation operations or the businesses of our joint ventures (including mortgage origination, title underwriting and real estate auction). In addition, with respect to many of our businesses as well as the businesses of certain of our joint ventures, RESPA and similar state laws generally require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. Some state authorities have also asserted enforcement rights.
RESPA and related regulations do, however, contain a number of provisions that allow for payments or fee splits between providers, including fee splits between title underwriters and their agents, real estate brokers and agents and market-based fees for the provision of goods or services, including marketing services. In addition, RESPA allows for the operation of affiliated business arrangements, including joint ventures, when specific requirements have been met. We rely on these provisions in conducting our business activities and believe our arrangements comply with RESPA. However, RESPA compliance may become a greater challenge under certain administrations, including the current administration, for most industry participants offering settlement services, including mortgage companies, title companies and brokerages, because of expansive interpretations of RESPA or similar state statutes by certain courts and regulators. Permissible activities under state statutes similar to RESPA may be interpreted more narrowly and enforcement proceedings of those statutes by state regulatory authorities may also be aggressively pursued. RESPA also has been invoked by plaintiffs in private litigation for various purposes. Some regulators and other parties have advanced novel and stringent interpretations of RESPA including assertions that any provision of a thing of value in a separate, but contemporaneous transaction with a referral constitutes a breach of RESPA on the basis that all things of value exchanged should be deemed in exchange for the referral. Violations of RESPA or similar state statutes can lead to claims of substantial damages, which may include (but are not limited to) fines, treble damages and attorneys' fees.
We are also subject to state laws limiting or prohibiting inducements, cash rebates and gifts to consumers, which impacts our lead generation business.
Worker Classification. Although the legal relationship between residential real estate brokers and licensed sales agents throughout most of the real estate industry historically has been that of independent contractor, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations in our and other industries, may impact industry practices, our company owned brokerage operations and our affiliated franchisees by seeking to reclassify licensed sales agents as employees.
Real estate laws generally permit brokers to engage sales agents as independent contractors. Federal and state agencies have their own rules and tests for classification of independent contractors as well as to determine whether employees meet exemptions from minimum wages and overtime laws. These tests consider many factors that also vary from state to state. The tests continue to evolve based on state case law decisions, regulations and legislative changes.
For example, in worker classification litigation involving real estate agents at a competing brokerage, the New Jersey Supreme Court recently remanded a case that had applied a strict classification test to a wage and hour case. The New Jersey Supreme Court recognized that a 2022 New Jersey legislative amendment clarified that an earlier 2018 amendment to the Brokerage Act affecting worker classification claims related to real estate agents should be applied retroactively. On remand, the New Jersey Appellate Division held that the strict test did not apply when determining classification of real 
estate agents, and that such determination applied retroactively based on the 2022 legislative amendment. The ruling notwithstanding, the Appellate Division did not dismiss the case due to remaining factual determinations to be made and declined to opine on the appropriate test to be applied when determining classification of real estate agents. Also, there have been several challenges to the constitutionality and enforceability of a California worker classification statute adopted in 2019 as it applies to other industries, which if found unconstitutional, could have the effect of eliminating that statute's less restrictive test applicable to real estate professionals in California. We continue to monitor these matters as well as related federal and state developments.
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations. To run our business, it is essential for us to collect, store and transmit sensitive personal information about our customers, prospects, employees, independent agents, and relocation transferees in our systems and networks. At the same time, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements, domestically and globally, that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, sale, or transfer of personal data. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs. For example, in the U.S., we are required to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information, as well as state statutes governing privacy and cybersecurity matters like the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and the New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") Cybersecurity Regulation.
The CCPA imposes comprehensive requirements on organizations that collect, sell and disclose personal information about California residents and employees. In November 2020, California passed Proposition 24, establishing the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which took effect January 1, 2023. The CPRA provides further requirements that will impact our businesses’ compliance efforts and operational risks as the CPRA differentiates “personal information” and “sensitive information,” expands the term “sale” to include sharing of personal information, and imposes data minimization and data retention requirements. The CPRA also established a new California Privacy Protection Agency, which is intended to take a more active role in enforcement of the law. Other states have passed privacy legislation that will take effect in 2023, and which differ from the CPRA in how they will be implemented. Other states are likely to implement their own privacy statutes in the near term.
Under the NYDFS cybersecurity regulation, regulated financial institutions, including Title Group, are required to establish a detailed cybersecurity program. Other state regulatory agencies have or are expected to enact similar requirements following the adoption of the Insurance Data Security Model Law by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is consistent with the New York regulation. 
Internationally, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") has conferred significant privacy rights on individuals (including employees and independent agents) and materially increased penalties for violations. In 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, one of the methods for transfers of personal data into the U.S. As a result, companies may have to rely on standard contractual clauses, or binding corporate rules for the transfer of personal data while awaiting further guidance or regulation. In 2021, the European Commission issued an implementing decision regarding the use of Standard Contractual Clauses. Other countries have also recently expanded on their data privacy laws and regulations. 
For additional information with respect to related risks facing our business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report, in particular under the caption "Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information or litigation or claims arising from such incidents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations."
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The TCPA restricts certain types of telemarketing calls and text messaging, and the use of automatic telephone dialing systems and artificial or prerecorded voice messages. The TCPA also established a national Do-Not-Call registry. The TCPA defines autodialing broadly and requires express written consent for certain communications to cellphones. Certain states have also adopted, or may in the future adopt, state equivalents of the TCPA. We are vulnerable to claims made by class action consumers alleging that we are liable for contacts made by independent contractor real estate agents.
Franchise Regulation. In the U.S., the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by federal law under the jurisdiction of the FTC. The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, multiple states and U.S. territories have "franchise relationship laws" or "business opportunity 
laws" that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements (including mandated notice or cure periods), to discriminate unfairly among franchisees, or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil liability to the franchisors. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. Internationally, many countries have similar laws affecting franchising.
State Brokerage Laws. Our company owned real estate brokerage business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales agents, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales agents, fiduciary, and agency and statutory duties, consumer disclosure obligations, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, restrictions on information sharing with affiliates, fair housing standards and advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, our company owned real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage businesses. 
Our company owned and franchised brokerages (and independent sales agents affiliated with such brokerages) are also required to comply with state and local laws related to dual agency (such as where the same brokerage represents both the buyer and seller of a home) and increased regulation of dual agency representation may restrict or reduce the ability of impacted brokerages to participate in certain real estate transactions.
Multiple Listing Services Rules. MLSs, NAR and respective state realtor associations each maintain rules, policies, data licenses, and terms of service, that specify, among other things, how MLS data and listings may be accessed, used, and displayed on websites and mobile applications. The rules of each MLS can vary widely and are complex. Changes in the rules and policies of NAR and the MLSs can also be driven by changes in membership, including the entry of new industry participants, as well as other industry forces including those discussed under the "Legal and Regulatory Environment" heading in this section.
Anti-Discrimination Laws. Our company owned and franchised brokerages, and agents affiliated with such brokerages, as well as our other businesses are subject to federal and state housing laws that generally make it illegal to discriminate against protected classes of individuals in housing or brokerage services. For example, the Fair Housing Act, its state and local law counterparts, and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, all prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, and, in some states or locales, financial capability, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, or source of income. Certain states or locales, such as New York, have or are in the process of expanding their laws.
Regulation of Title Insurance and Settlement Services. Nearly all states license and regulate title agencies, escrow companies and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States may periodically lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States may also require title agencies, escrow companies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital. 
Certain states in which we operate have "controlled business" statutes which impose limitations on the level of business our title and escrow companies can receive from its affiliated real estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers. We are aware of the states imposing such limits and monitor the others to ensure that if they implement such a limit, we will be prepared to comply with any such rule. "Controlled business" typically is defined as sources controlled by, or which control, directly or indirectly, or are under common control with, the title agent. Pursuant to regulations in New York, title agents with affiliated businesses must make a good faith effort to obtain and be open for title insurance business from all sources and not business only from affiliated persons, including actively competing in the marketplace. The Company's failure to comply with such statutes could result in the payment of fines and penalties or the non-renewal of the Company's license to provide title, escrow and settlement services. We provide our services not only to our affiliates but also to third-party businesses in the geographic areas in which we operate. Accordingly, we manage our business in a manner to comply with any applicable "controlled business" statutes by ensuring that we generate sufficient business from sources we do not control.
Regulation of the Mortgage Industry. We participate in the mortgage origination business through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity. Private mortgage lenders operating in the U.S. are subject to comprehensive state and federal regulation and to significant oversight by government sponsored entities.
