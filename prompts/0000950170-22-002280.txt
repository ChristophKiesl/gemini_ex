Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading party goods company by revenue in North America and, we believe, the largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods globally by revenue. With hundreds of retail stores filled with thousands of products across the United States, we make it easy for our customers to find the perfect party solution through our assortment of party products, balloons, and costumes for their celebration aided by the support of our party experts both in-store and online. Our retail operations include approximately 830 specialty retail party supply stores (including franchise stores) throughout North America operating under the names Party City and Halloween City, and e-commerce websites which offer rapid, contactless, and same day shipping options (including in-store and at curbside), principally through the domain name PartyCity.com.
 In addition to our retail operations, we are also one of the largest global designers, manufacturers and distributors of decorated consumer party products, with items found in retail outlets worldwide, including independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, e-commerce merchandisers and dollar stores. We combine state-of-the-art manufacturing and sourcing operations, sophisticated wholesale operations and multi-channel retail and e-commerce retail operations to design, manufacture, source and distribute party goods, including

paper and plastic tableware, metallic and latex balloons, Halloween and other costumes, accessories, novelties, gifts and stationery throughout the world. Our products are available or licensed in over 100 countries with the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Mexico and Australia among the largest end markets for our products outside of the United States.
Industry Overview
We operate in the broadly defined retail party goods industry and Halloween market. The party goods industry includes decorative paper and plastic tableware, costumes, decorations, accessories, and balloons, all of which are supported by a range of vendors from commodity paper goods producers to party goods manufacturers. The retail landscape for decorated party goods is comprised primarily of party superstores, mass merchants, e-commerce merchandisers, craft stores, grocery retailers, and dollar stores. Sales of party goods are fueled by everyday events such as backyard BBQs, graduations, birthdays, baby showers, weddings, and anniversaries, as well as seasonal events such as holidays and other special occasions.
 Segments
We have two reporting segments: retail and wholesale. In 2021, we generated 81.5% of our total revenues from our retail segment and 18.5% of our total revenues from our wholesale segment.
Our retail segment generates revenue primarily through the sale of our party supplies, which are sold under the Amscan, Anagram and Costumes USA brand names, through our Party City stores, Halloween City stores and PartyCity.com.
Our wholesale segment revenues are generated from the sale of decorated party goods for all occasions. Our products are sold at wholesale to party superstores (including our owned retail stores, franchised stores operating principally as "Party City"), and unaffiliated specialty retailers, mass merchants, e-commerce merchandisers, craft stores, grocery retailers, and dollar stores.
Financial information about our industry segments and geographic segments is provided in Note 19 — Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Product Lines
Our enterprise-wide product lines span a wide variety of ways to celebrate everyday events including from birthdays to theme parties to sporting events. Additionally, we offer seasonal products throughout the year to decorate and dress up for holidays such as Halloween, New Year’s Eve and Mardi Gras.

Retail Operations
Overview
Party City has grown to become what we believe is the largest operator of owned and franchised party superstores by revenue in the United States. We provide a broad and deep product assortment at a compelling value with an average of 25,000 SKUs offered at any one time through our retail stores and 40,000 SKUs offered online through our e-commerce platform. We keep our assortment current by frequently introducing new products, and we organize our stores by events and themes to make it easy to shop while consistently presenting customers with additional product ideas that will enhance their events and our sales. With our product selection and convenient locations, we believe customers associate Party City with successful celebrations, and as a result, we believe our physical and online stores will continue to be seen as the favored destination for party supplies and related innovative ideas.
Our websites, including PartyCity.com, offer a convenient, user-friendly and secure online shopping option for our customers. In addition to the ability to order products, our websites provide a substantial amount of content about our party products, party planning ideas and promotional offers. The websites are also one of our key marketing vehicles, specifically as they relate to social media marketing initiatives.
Our Company-owned stores are located entirely in the United States. We have franchised stores throughout the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico run by franchisees utilizing our format, design specifications, methods, standards, operating procedures, systems and trademarks. Our wholesale sales to franchised stores generally mirror, with respect to relative size, mix and category, sales to our company-owned stores. We are not currently marketing, nor do we plan to market, franchises in the United States.
The following table shows the change in our company-owned Party City store network over the past three years:


 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
Stores open at beginning of year | | 746 | | | 777 | | 866 | 
Stores opened | | 10 | | | 5 | | 5 |

Stores closed and sold | | (7 | ) | | (42 | ) | (100 | )
Stores open at end of year | | 759 | | | 746 | | 777 | 

 
The following table shows the change in our franchise-owned store network over the past three years:


 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
Stores open at beginning of year | | 85 | | | 98 | | 96

Stores closed or converted to independent stores | | (3 | ) | | (7 | ) | — 
Stores open at end of year | | 72 | | | 85 | | 98

 
We receive revenue from our franchisees, consisting of an initial one-time fee and ongoing royalty fees, generally ranging from 4% to 6% of net sales. In exchange for these franchise fees, franchisees principally receive brand value and merchandising support with respect to planograms. Each franchisee has a mandated advertising budget, which consists of a minimum initial store opening promotion and ongoing local advertising and promotions. Additionally, franchisees must pay 1% to 2.25% of net sales to a group advertising fund to cover common advertising materials. Our franchise agreements provide us with a right of first refusal should any franchisee wish to dispose of its operations.
Current franchise agreements provide for an assigned area or territory that typically equals a three or four-mile radius from the franchisee’s store location and the right to use the Party City® logo and trademark. In addition, certain agreements with our franchisees and other business partners contain geographic limitations on opening new stores. For most stores, the franchisee or the majority owner of a corporate franchisee devotes full time to the management, operation and on-premises supervision of the stores or groups of stores.

Retail Seasonality
 Our retail operations are subject to significant seasonal variations. Historically, this segment has realized a significant portion of its revenues, cash flow and net income in the fourth quarter of the year, principally due to our Halloween sales in October and, to a lesser extent, year-end holiday sales. To maximize our seasonal opportunity, we operate a chain of temporary Halloween stores, under the Halloween City brand, during the months of September and October of each year. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section in Part III, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our seasonality.
 Wholesale Operations
Overview
We currently offer nearly 400 ensembles, which range from approximately five to 40 design-coordinated items spanning tableware, accessories, novelties, balloons and decorations. Our in-house design team introduces approximately 6,000 products annually, driving innovation in our licensed and unlicensed product offering and supporting increased sales across our channels. From time to time, we rationalize our existing product offerings to stay on trend. The breadth of these ensembles enables our retail stores and third-party retailers to promote additional sales of related products for every occasion. To enhance our customers’ celebrations of life’s important events, we market party goods ensembles for a wide variety of occasions, including seasonal and religious holidays, special events and themed celebrations. Our Amscan and Anagram branded products are offered in retail outlets worldwide, ranging from party goods superstores (including our franchise stores), other party goods retailers, mass merchants, independent card and gift stores, dollar stores, grocery and drug stores and e-commerce merchandisers. We have long-term relationships with many of our wholesale customers.
The table below shows the breakdown of our total wholesale sales by channel for the year ended December 31, 2021:


Channel | Sales | 
 | (dollars in millions) | 
Owned stores and e-commerce | $ | 590
Party City franchised stores and other domestic retailers | | 171
Domestic balloon distributors/retailers | | 92 
International | | 138
Total wholesale sales | $ | 991

Wholesale Manufactured Products
Our manufacturing facilities are highly automated and produce paper and plastic plates and cups, paper napkins, metallic and latex balloons, injection molded product, costumes, pinatas and other party and novelty items at globally competitive costs. State-of-the-art printing, forming, folding, and packaging equipment support most of these manufacturing operations. Given our size and sales volume, we are generally able to operate our manufacturing equipment on the basis of at least two shifts per day, thus lowering production costs per unit. In select cases, we use available capacity to manufacture products for third parties, which allows us to maintain a satisfactory level of equipment utilization.
Complementing our manufacturing facilities, we have a diverse global network of third-party vendors that support our strategy of consistently offering a broad selection of high quality, innovative and competitively priced product. We have relationships that exceed twenty years with many of our vendors and often represent a significant portion of their overall business. They generally produce items designed by and created for us, are located in Asia, and are managed by our sourcing office in Hong Kong. We actively work with our third-party vendors to ensure product cost, quality, and safety.
The principal raw materials in our products or in manufacturing our products are cotton, paper and petroleum-based resin. While we currently purchase raw materials from preferred vendors, we continue to evaluate the marketplace to expand our sources. We’re continuously looking at innovation and evolving market conditions and working on plans to mitigate any potential headwinds.
Wholesale Product Safety and Quality Assurance
We are subject to regulatory requirements in the United States and internationally, and we believe that all products that we manufacture and source comply with the requirements in the markets in which they are sold. Third-party manufactured products are tested in accordance with our testing policies and procedures, both at the manufacturing site and upon arrival at our distribution centers. We have a full-time staff of professionals in the United States, Asia and Europe dedicated to product safety and quality assurance.
Wholesale Distribution and Systems
We ship our products directly to retailers and distributors throughout the world from our distribution facilities, as well as directly from our factories. Our electronic order entry and information systems allow us to manage our inventory.
Our main distribution facility for domestic party customers is located in Chester, New York, which is nearly 900,000 square feet. This state-of-the-art facility serves as the main point of distribution for our products and utilizes a paperless, pick-by-light system, a Goods-To-Person (OSR) picking system, offering what we believe to be superior inventory management and turnaround times.
Wholesale Customers
We have a diverse third-party customer base in our wholesale segment and are not materially dependent on one or a few major customers.
 Strategic Initiatives
 We continue to advance our strategic initiatives that underpin efforts to grow our retail and wholesale businesses and expand on our purpose of creating joy by making it easy to create unforgettable memories.
  Product Innovation. In 2021, we continued to leverage consumer insights and sales data to drive review of our wholesale product offerings and retail assortment decisions which accelerated overall sales growth in important categories. During the year, we reset: Party Favors, Girl’s Birthday, Boy’s Birthday, Candy and Solid Tableware and approximately 1,000 new products driven by consumer-led innovation. In 2022, we will reset the remaining categories in our portfolio and will launch a similar number of innovative items as well as significant quality improvements to compliment the work in innovation.
 Enhance the in-store experience. We remodeled or opened "next generation" or NXTGEN stores, all of which are Company-owned, bringing our total to 95 as of year-end 2021. The material changes to our stores include a new shop-in-shop store layout with improved product adjacencies, edited and more curated product assortments, which result in reduced carrying inventory, as well as new services and experiences. A balloon shop and customer engagement center are the focal point of the store and add significant theater to the entire experience. Balloon sales growth in our NXTGEN stores are higher than the trend in the balance of our stores. We continue to be pleased with the customer feedback we are receiving on the NXTGEN stores as we enhance and refine the prototype. Customers have told us that they appreciate the decluttering of the stores due to the lower sightlines and the more curated assortment.
  Being celebration occasion-obsessed. In 2021, we were focused on our core categories and therefore, growing our relevancy with consumers as we build trust and become their destination for all things celebrations. We believe this focus paid off due to our strong core metrics that are a testament to our improved relevancy. Additionally, our seasonal categories are generating improved sell-throughs resulting in improved inventory turns and gross margin returns on inventory. In 2022, we will continue to focus on improvements in our core and seasonal categories, driven by greater focus on current trends, key items and more curated assortments, which we believe will improve the shopping experience for the consumer and efficiency for store associates.

 Focus on the North America vertical model. Our North American vertical model remains a key competitive advantage for us and in 2021 we continued to leverage this unique attribute. Namely, we made investments in our leadership, infrastructure and resources throughout the supply chain network in North America. We have increased our capacity in our manufacturing plants as we strengthen our domestic capabilities and execution. As a result, we believe we have navigated supply chain challenges well and our teams have done an excellent job of navigating a difficult environment.
 Information Systems

Our information systems are integral in supporting our long-term strategies, are key capabilities necessary to help support all levers of growth, and help us implement informed, data-driven decision making throughout our organization. We are continually working on enhancing our digital technology platforms and elevating our e-commerce capabilities through new functionalities to our retail and wholesale channels. In fiscal 2021, we successfully completed key security enhancements which will serve as the backbone of our ongoing IT roadmap and commenced cloud-based technology infrastructure projects to be completed in fiscal 2022.
 
We also maintain entity-wide information security and privacy compliance programs, comprised of risk management policies and procedures surrounding our information systems, cybersecurity practices and protection of consumer and employee personal data and confidential information. Our Board of Directors (the "Board") has ultimate oversight of our risk management policies and procedures and has delegated primary responsibility for monitoring the risks and programs in this area to the Audit Committee, which receives regular updates on information security and privacy risk and compliance from management. The Board also receives periodic updates on these topics. As part of our compliance programs, all global employees are required to take annual training on information security, including cybersecurity, global data privacy requirements and compliance measures. We also conduct periodic internal and third-party assessments to test our cybersecurity controls, perform cyber simulations, and continually evaluate our privacy notices, policies and procedures surrounding our handling and control of personal data and the systems we have in place to help protect us from cybersecurity or personal data breaches. Additionally, we maintain network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection in the event of certain covered cyber losses and data breaches.

Refer to Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors," for further information as it relates to our Information Systems.
 Intellectual Property
We own the copyrights in the designs we create and use on our products and various trademarks and service marks used on or in connection with our products. At our discretion, we may permit franchisees, licensees, and other parties to use our trademarks and service marks. It is our practice to register our copyrights with the United States Copyright Office and our trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or with other foreign jurisdictions, to the extent we deem necessary. In addition, we rely on unregistered common law trademark rights and unregistered copyrights under applicable U.S. law to distinguish and/or protect our products, services and branding. From time to time, we attain patent protection for novel inventions. We do not believe that the loss of any copyrights, trademarks or patents with respect to any particular product or products would have a material adverse effect on our business. We hold numerous intellectual property licenses from third parties, allowing us to use various third-party cartoon and other characters and designs on our products, and the images on our metallic balloons and costumes are principally covered by these licenses. None of these license relationships are individually material to our aggregate business.
Competition
 Our segment of the retail industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. We operate in the party goods retail sector, which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, and customer service, including merchandise delivery and checkout options. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high-value, high-quality, low-cost merchandise in conveniently located stores. Our sales and profits could

be reduced by increases in competition. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector.
 Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting our business, including product safety, consumer protection, privacy, truth-in-advertising, accessibility, customs, wage and hour laws and regulations, and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate manufacturers and retailers generally and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, retail stores and e-commerce. We also are subject to similar international laws and regulations affecting our business. The Company maintains an internal global trade, customs, and product compliance organization to help manage its import/export compliance activities. Several state and local governments have been successful in regulating or prohibiting the sale of balloons filled with lighter than air gas and single-use plastic products. We have sought partnership with legislators and regulators to help protect and steward environmental goals and promote the responsible use of our products.
As a franchisor, we must comply with regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission, such as the Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising, which requires us, among other things, to furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular. We also must comply with several state laws that regulate the offer and sale of our franchises and certain substantive aspects of franchisor-franchisee relationships. These laws vary in their application and in their regulatory requirements.
Human Capital Disclosure
 People matter at Party City. In 2021, we employed approximately 6,400 full time and 10,100 part time team members to play a critical role in delivering our company purpose to inspire and make it easy for our customers to create unforgettable memories. We seek to embed this purpose and the principles that guide us in how we work every day – Customer First, People Matter, It Can Be Done and Celebrate – into the culture through enterprise-wide change initiatives, grounded in the retention and engagement of our team members.
 Attracting and Engaging Employees. We endeavor to make it easy to be a successful employee at Party City. We offer a comprehensive on-boarding programs as well as a variety of leadership, technical and compliance training that enables our employees to contribute to the company’s most important initiatives. Our leaders also participate in training focused specifically on leading in a hybrid environment. We have advanced engagement by fostering two-way dialogues via employee surveys and communication forums as well as enhanced and simplified technology-enabled people operations support and access to employee information. We have an "open door" policy for employees to report concerns and we also provide an anonymous reporting hotline available in multiple languages and managed by an independent third party.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. We designed our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (D, E, I & B) strategy in 2020 and we have continued that work with the implementation of an Enterprise Belonging Council as well as a Diversity Review Committee, both fueled by employee participation and leadership commitment. We endeavor to weave the key tenants of our D, E, I & B strategy into the fabric of our transformation and people programs and processes.
 Total Rewards. Our total rewards and benefits programs have been harmonized across the enterprise to maximize effectiveness and to accelerate eligibility for participation. We offer comprehensive benefits including medical, dental and vision, as well as a healthcare concierge that partners with employees to more effectively and efficiently navigate the healthcare system. We have implemented and expanded reward programs tied to short and long-term priorities and performance. We believe that offering our team members access to comprehensive total rewards programs are important steps to drive employee retention and positive employee relations. We have also

improved market competitiveness by making significant investments in compensation to attract, retain and engage our talent in our retail stores and throughout our manufacturing plants and in our distribution centers.
 Talent Attraction. We have redesigned our talent attraction and succession management approach from the top down, which we believe will improve our implementation of key strategies to address localized market conditions. We believe these targeted efforts to meet immediate and long-term staffing needs and build capability to deliver our overall business strategy.
 Safety. Safety is a priority and we have invested in training and awareness campaigns to promote safe operating practices in our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, stores and corporate offices. We maintained a rigorous focus on protocols and safety practices including masking, social distancing, temperature checks and sanitizing and we continue to invest in resources to track and manage COVID-19 cases.
 Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
At the board level, our Nominating and ESG Committee (the “NESG Committee”) oversees our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) programs, policies and practices. The NESG Committee’s duties include monitoring and evaluating the Company’s programs, policies and practices relating to ESG issues and making recommendations to the Board regarding the Company’s overall ESG strategy. In 2022, we continued to advance our ESG strategy by establishing a management-level ESG Steering Committee, which is comprised of senior leaders and cross-functional members from major business functions. The purpose of the ESG Steering Committee is to (i) establish programs, policies and practices relating to ESG matters and (ii) assist the NESG Committee in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to ESG matters. We have conducted an ESG Priority Assessment to identify the ESG topics that are most relevant for our business and shareholders, as well as customers, business partners, employees and communities, and intend to use the results of this assessment to guide our efforts as we further develop and advance our ESG strategy, in an effort to enhance our long-term value. We believe our approach to ESG management helps to enable us to create long-term value for our stockholders, through advancing interests of our other stakeholders.
