The following is a description of our reportable segments.

Earth Intelligence
​
Overview
​
In the Earth Intelligence segment, we are a global leader in high-resolution, space-based Earth observation imagery products and analytics. We launched the world’s first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite in 1999 and currently operate a four satellite Earth observation constellation, providing us with over two decades and approximately 150 petabytes of imagery over our history (referred to as our “Image Library”) of the highest resolution, commercially available imagery. Our imagery solutions provide customers with timely, accurate and mission critical information about our changing planet and support a wide variety of government and enterprise applications, including mission planning, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, disaster management, crop management, oil and gas exploration and infrastructure management. We continue to innovate as demands for new satellite technology and advanced analytic tools increase. In addition to our Earth observation capabilities, we offer Radio Frequency (“RF”) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (“SAR”) data, which provides more comprehensive and accurate geospatial insights for our customers. Through our updated National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) remote sensing license, we are also able to collect non-Earth imaging (“NEI”) for our current constellation and our next generation WorldView Legion satellites. Through this new license authority, we can collect and distribute images of space objects across the Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) – the area ranging from 200 kilometers up to 1,000 kilometers in altitude – to both government and commercial customers. In the commercial satellite Earth observation industry, we are a leader across U.S. government agencies, international government agencies and enterprise customer verticals. The U.S. government is the largest customer of our Earth Intelligence segment through the Electro-Optical Commercial Layer Program (“EOCL Contract”), Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery (“G-EGD”) and One World Terrain (“OWT”) programs and various classified and unclassified contract vehicles. 
​
We also provide geospatial services that combine imagery, analytic expertise and innovative technology to deliver intelligence solutions to customers. Our approximately 1,500 cleared personnel support analytic solutions that accurately document change and enable geospatial modeling and analysis that help predict where events will occur. Our primary customer of geospatial services is the U.S. government, but we also support intelligence requirements for other U.S. allied governments, global development organizations and enterprise customers. We are also a global leader in satellite-derived 3D data for defense and intelligence markets, with software and products that enhance 3D mapping, Earth intelligence data, military simulation and training and precision-guided munitions.

The Maxar News Bureau is a partnership program with trusted media organizations around the world. We provide satellite imagery as visual evidence of ground truth to promote global transparency and expose injustice. Access to our high-resolution satellite imagery has enabled journalists to accurately report on areas that are too remote or dangerous to visit or are otherwise inaccessible.
​
Our Earth Observation Constellation
​
As of December 31, 2022, we operated a constellation of four in-orbit and fully commissioned Earth observation satellites: GeoEye-1, WorldView-1, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3. Our annual collection capacity is approximately 1.4 billion square kilometers. We have collected, and have available for use, approximately 150 petabytes in our Image Library.
​
We re-evaluate the depreciable lives of our satellites annually based on established methodologies used for accounting purposes. The lives we assign for depreciation purposes are typically shorter than the lives we use for planning purposes and our history shows that in most cases the estimated useful lives of our satellites have increased from the initial lives determined upon launch.
​
The following table summarizes the primary characteristics of the in-orbit and fully-commissioned Earth observation satellites in our constellation as of December 31, 2022:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------+---+----------------+---+----------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------
Satellite | ​ | Launch Date | ​ | Expected End of Depreciable Life | ​ | Best Ground Resolution | ​ | Orbital Altitude (kilometers)
WorldView-3 | ​ | August 2014 | ​ | Q1 2026 | ​ | 31-centimeters black and white, or color 1.24-meter multi-spectral | ​ | 618 
WorldView-2 | ​ | October 2009 | ​ | Q4 2024 | ​ | 46-centimeters black and white, or color 1.84-meter multi-spectral | ​ | 770 
WorldView-1 | ​ | September 2007 | ​ | Q3 2024 | ​ | 50-centimeters panchromatic | ​ | 496 
GeoEye-1 | ​ | September 2008 | ​ | Q3 2024 | ​ | 41-centimeters black and white, or color 1.64-meter multi-spectral | ​ | 681 

​
​
WorldView Legion will be a fleet of six high performing satellites for which our Space Infrastructure segment is acting as prime contractor. We expect that WorldView Legion, in addition to our current constellation, will revisit rapidly changing areas up to 15 times per day, an increase from four times per day currently, which will more than triple both our capacity to collect 30 cm-class imagery and our overall capacity in high demand areas.
​
Our Earth observation satellites have advanced technical capabilities, such as maneuverability, size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity. Additionally, our satellites are designed, manufactured and operated in the U.S. for assurance of U.S. national security missions and data protection.

​
We procure insurance to protect us from the risks associated with our satellite operations, including the partial or total loss of the functional capacity of the satellite. We insure satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance is available at acceptable premiums. As of December 31, 2022, we maintained the following insurance coverage on our in-orbit and fully-commissioned Earth observation satellite constellation:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------+---+-----------------+---+-----------------------+----
Satellite | ​ | Policy Period | ​ | Coverage(in millions)
WorldView-3 | ​ | 10/2022-10/2023 | ​ | $ | 255
WorldView-2 | ​ | 10/2022-10/2023 | ​ | ​ | 220
WorldView-1 | ​ | 10/2022-10/2023 | ​ | ​ | 220
GeoEye-1 | ​ | 10/2022-10/2023 | ​ | ​ | 38 

​
Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we have procured insurance for our WorldView Legion satellite launches of $620 million. These policies cover the launches plus the first year in orbit. Following the first year in orbit, we will seek to obtain in-orbit coverage similar to the coverage we currently have on our in-orbit and fully-commissioned satellite constellation noted in the table above.
​
Competitive Conditions and Trends in Industry Demands
​
Our Earth Intelligence business operates in a highly competitive and rapidly growing industry. Our major existing and potential competitors for our Earth Intelligence business include commercial satellite imagery companies, state-owned imagery providers, aerial imagery companies, free sources of imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles and companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors. We face competition from companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors such as L3Harris and Booz Allen Hamilton.
​
We compete on the basis of several factors, including: the technical capabilities of our satellites, such as size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity; satellite availability for tasked orders; the size, comprehensiveness and relevance of our Image Library; on-demand platforms and tools that enable customers to easily access and integrate imagery; value-added services, including harnessing advancements in ML by applying computer vision and pattern analysis technology to geospatial problems; and derivative products such as 3D models and map vector data.
​
The Earth observation market includes the collection and processing of optical and non-optical imagery data of the Earth. Specifically, the market is segmented into Data, Value-Added Services (“VAS”), Information Products and Big Data Analytics. The Data segment consists of raw imagery transmitted from the satellite to the ground station and products, such as stereo imaging and basic corrections (radiometric and geometric). VAS includes processing through layering or data fusion (such as with traffic information and street names). Big Data Analytics includes statistical analysis, change detection and predictive modeling using large quantities of imagery and meta data overlays to provide insights over a given period of time.
​
Our Earth Intelligence business provides Earth observation services to customers in a variety of sectors, including defense and intelligence, energy and natural resources, industrials, social media, mapping, managed living resources (such as agriculture and forestry), public authorities, services (such as finance, insurance, news and media) and weather. Providers of imagery and data in this market generally compete on resolution, accuracy, revisit frequency, delivery (cloud versus traditional) and pricing. 
​
Euroconsult reports that the commercial market for Earth observation data was $1.7 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to top $2.7 billion by 2031, a compound annual growth rate of 5%. According to Euroconsult, defense represents approximately 69% of the Earth observation data market, and sales to non-U.S. defense markets are forecasted to be the most significant driver of revenue growth, driven by higher revisit constellations with higher resolutions. Euroconsult reports the commercial market for Earth observation VAS was $2.8 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to top $5.2 billion by 2031, a compound annual growth rate of 6%.

7



​
In addition to the demands for commercial Earth observation data and VAS, we believe our Earth Intelligence offerings address a number of multi-billion dollar military use-cases and sectors, including 3D mapping, precision guided munitions and military simulation and virtual training. Additionally, as we further develop our 3D offerings, we see additional commercial market opportunities for our data and services, particularly within the immersive 3D environments of the augmented reality (“AR”)/virtual reality (“VR”) accessed metaverse, media and entertainment. As businesses increasingly use 3D simulations for decision support and consumers spend more time in AR /VR environments for education, gaming, entertainment, news, networking, shopping and more, our global 3D models can help bridge the physical and digital worlds with increased accuracy and realism.
​

Spacecraft
​
Today, 155 custom Maxar-built spacecrafts for Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (“GEO”) satellites have launched with a combined 2,022 years of service. 72 GEO satellites have completed their missions and provided Maxar customers with an additional 386 years of operation beyond mission requirements. In addition, Maxar has manufactured and placed into service 81 low Earth orbit (“LEO”) satellites.
​
Maxar continues as a world leader in commercial GEO communication satellites and a global leader in commercial satellite manufacturing. With three decades of on-orbit heritage, our 1300-class spacecraft platform is the world’s most popular GEO satellite; 94 spacecraft are currently in service, providing 99.9972% uptime availability for our customers. We continue to provide a high level of value and partnership to communications customers around the globe. Key platform features include a scalable, lightweight and high-strength structure, fuel-efficient attitude and station-keeping subsystems, high-efficiency and reliable solar arrays and batteries, and advanced command and control subsystems. A growing application for commercial geostationary communication satellites is the delivery of data-centric applications (such as consumer broadband, in-flight communication, maritime and 4G/5G cellular backhaul) via high-capacity spot beam satellites commonly referred to as high-throughput satellites (or “HTS”). We introduced the first HTS satellite in 2005, which used the 1300-class bus, and believe it offers the highest capability for the cost. Maxar is building JUPITER 3, a transformational Ultra High Density Satellite, for Hughes Network Systems (“Hughes”) to be designated EchoStar 

8



XXIV. This satellite is expected to be the world’s largest commercial communications satellite when it launches, and will power future generations of Hughes consumer, enterprise and aeronautical services across the Americas.
​
In addition to continued leadership in the commercial communications sector, we collaborate closely with customers to design and deliver smaller satellites to address growing demand for LEO and medium Earth orbit (“MEO”) constellations. We believe Maxar’s LEO capabilities will be effective for applications that require a multiple satellite constellation of identical satellites produced in a cost-efficient manner. Designed, engineered and built in-house, these modular satellite platforms illustrate Maxar’s ability to adapt and extend its deep experience to provide agile, affordable solutions in proliferated, LEO constellations. In 2022 Maxar was selected by L3Harris and the U.S. Space Development Agency to design and build the platform for 14 spacecraft platforms for the Tranche 1 Tracking Layer supporting missile warning and tracking.
​
The 1300-class platform is key to our continued and growing partnership with NASA as well. The Psyche mission is a journey to a unique metal asteroid, named 16 Psyche, that appears to be the exposed metal core of an early planet–a building block of a solar system. The spacecraft leverages Maxar’s 1300-class platform and solar electric propulsion system, the highly efficient SPT-140. In addition, Maxar is hosting NASA’s Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (“TEMPO”)—a commercially hosted pollution monitoring payload on a commercial communications satellite Maxar is building for satellite operator Intelsat. By hosting payloads on its commercial satellites, Maxar can help government agencies obtain access to space for instruments, sensors and other small missions without the cost of building a dedicated spacecraft. Similarly, the hosted payload helps commercial customers share the cost of the satellite bus, launch and operations.
​
Competitive Conditions and Trends in Industry Demands
​
Our principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide.

We sell our products and technologies in a highly competitive industry and we compete on the basis of cost, reliability, design life, technological capabilities and efficiencies. Our primary competitors for satellite manufacturing contracts are: The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation in the United States; Thales S.A. and Airbus Defence and Space, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, in Europe; and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in Japan. Additionally, we face competition from newer entrants. In addition, many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. We may also face competition in the future from emerging low-cost competitors in India, Russia and China.
​
GEO satellites track with the rotation of the Earth and remain over a fixed point over the Earth’s surface. GEO satellites cover more area from a higher vantage point and tend to carry more advanced sensor or communication suites, as used in broad area communications and global-scale weather payloads. Due to this unique property of their orbit, GEO slots are limited, which motivates operators to maximize the use of their slot, leading to generally larger satellites to support the required power and bandwidth, as well as a longer design life to maximize return on investment. Due to their greater distance from Earth, however, there is increased latency.
The satellite industry has undergone a significant change with the proliferation of LEO satellites, which have been primarily used for both Earth observation and communications payloads. Typically, LEO constellation satellites are cheaper to launch as they are significantly smaller and require less fuel to reach orbit. Additionally, due to the lower orbital altitude, LEO observation satellites enable higher resolution imagery. This factor also enables LEO communication satellites to reduce latency but require a much larger constellation to ensure coverage over a given area as, unlike GEO satellites, LEO satellites move in and out of view of ground locations as they complete their orbit. In addition to altitude class, satellites are classified by functions, such as communications or Earth observation.
Euroconsult projects satellite demand will experience a five-fold increase over the next ten years. While LEO is expected to account for the majority of the demand, Euroconsult expects an average of 13 GEO commercial satellite orders per year over the next ten years, representing one-third of the total market value. According to Euroconsult, the 

9



total market for manufacturing and launch services is expected to reach $400 billion over the next decade, a 46% increase from the previous decade of $273 billion in revenue.
​
LEO proliferation is expected to greatly increase access to space, thus enabling new commercial customers across diversified industries including oil and gas, insurance, agriculture and asset management firms, as well as nonprofit organizations, to benefit from satellite imagery.
​
Discontinued Operations
​
On April 8, 2020, we completed the sale of our former Canadian subsidiary (“MDA Business”) to Neptune Acquisition Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and an affiliate of Northern Private Capital Ltd. See Note 3, “Discontinued Operations”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding our sale of the MDA Business.
​
Industry Overview
​
Large and Growing Addressable Market
​
We believe that there is potential for growth among three key components of our addressable market: the U.S. government, other governments and commercial customers. For both the U.S. and other governments, drivers of growth include persistent global security threats, defense budgets, demand for high-quality imagery and value-added services and a focus on space as an investment. We believe that the U.S. government is interested in expanding the use of commercial alternatives to owned assets and that other governments present an opportunity for growth. We seek to align our products and services with the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”)’s National Defense Strategy needs, as well as growing international defense and intelligence demand. For civil customers, in particular NASA, growth is being driven by space exploration programs such as Artemis and Earth science projects. For commercial customers, drivers of growth include strong demand for 3D imagery and more frequent imagery refreshes, as well as insights driven by AI and ML, space-based remote sensing, GEO replacement demand and LEO communications programs.
​
Diverse Solutions for Diverse End Market Users
​
While traditionally spending in space has been dominated by military defense programs and the communications industry, the proliferation of technology and cheaper access to space has led to a diversification in end market users. AI, ML and cloud computing have given rise to multiple use cases across industries, such as mobility and logistics, insurance, finance, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, non-governmental organizations and emerging technologies in simulation, gaming, AR/VR and the metaverse. Concurrently, geopolitical competition in space as a contested domain is leading to further investment by global militaries. We have evolved with this changing environment to serve a multitude of customers.
​
Government Investment in Space Programs
​
With more than half of our revenues coming from U.S. government customers, we expect that our Space Infrastructure and Earth Intelligence segments will benefit from growing defense and space infrastructure budgets. We expect the proliferation of space-based ISR and communications to drive increased government investments in the sector through the mid-2020s.
​
Global
Euroconsult reports that government space budgets reached $103 billion in 2022, a 9% increase over 2021 figures. Additionally, Euroconsult reports the gap between civil and defense space budgets continues to decrease, with civil budgets totaling $55 billion and defense space programs totaling $48 billion in 2022. Looking forward, Euroconsult expects that the rapid growth of defense budgets will continue in the short-term but will eventually lessen later in the decade as current growth trajectories do not appear sustainable in the long-term.

10



United States
In the U.S., there is a concerted effort by the government to accelerate space investment. Congress appropriated $26.3 billion for the fiscal year (“FY”) 2023 for the National Security Space (“NSS”) programs, representing growth of 45% from FY 2022 of $18.1 billion. The request is now inclusive of the budgets for Space Force and the Space Development Agency. 
The NSS budget generally excludes funding for the NRO and NGA. Specific funding levels for these organizations, which are long-term historical customers of our Earth Intelligence segment, are generally classified. However, the NRO and NGA are included in the funding for the National Intelligence Program (“NIP”). The requested funding for the NIP for FY 2023 was $67.1 billion, a 2% increase from the FY 2022 enacted budget of $65.7 billion. Additionally, the requested funding for the Military Intelligence Program (“MIP”) was $26.6 billion for FY 2023, a 10% increase from the FY 2022 enacted budget of $24.1 billion.
Furthermore, NASA received $25.4 billion in FY 2023, an increase of 5% from FY 2022. The NASA budget further highlights an effort by the government to invest in space exploration and development, with $8.7 billion of the total allocated for deep space exploration systems and space technology. These include the key components of On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing (“OSAM-1”) and the Artemis program that will send astronauts to the Moon and beyond, including the lunar Gateway.
​
Growth Strategy
Our vision is to hold leading positions in each of the sectors we serve. We aim to achieve this by applying innovative technologies and capabilities that provide value to our customers across their entire value chain, including components, subsystems, systems, data and services. Specific elements of our strategy across our two segments include:
Earth Intelligence
Driving revenue growth through improvements in our products—We seek to improve and develop new Earth Intelligence products with WorldView Legion by productizing technologies and derivative content developed in support of individual customer contracts, such as using more AI/ML to extract features, detect objects and detect change in our satellite imagery and complementary content. We believe we provide imagery with better than three times the accuracy of the nearest small-sat competitor and we believe that our accuracy advantage is even greater in areas where we have leveraged our 3D and elevation capabilities. We believe we will be able to provide even greater quality imagery and with higher revisit rates upon deployment of our WorldView Legion satellites. The revisit rate and increase in capacity enables a clearer understanding of on-ground conditions, allowing for more real-time, actionable analysis to deliver insights on rapidly changing environments and populations, while providing for more frequent monitoring for defense and intelligence applications, enhanced emergency responsiveness and maritime surveillance, among other applications. We have developed technology used to enhance the quality and usability of imagery (e.g. eliminate atmospheric distortions, increase positional accuracy, improved interpretability, etc.), create information derivatives (e.g. road vectors, material types, land classification, etc.), fuse multiple types of content (e.g. Internet of Things, optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar imagery, radio frequency information, vectors, social media, etc.), to detect change, understand patterns of life and gain early warning of trending events. We believe this type of high-resolution, highly accurate collection capacity will power wide-area, AI/ML modeling, sensor-to-decision applications and a reference globe for AR/VR metaverse applications. Additionally, we believe our resolution and accuracy are key enablers for deriving highly accurate and life-like 3D models, which will allow customers to transition from 2D to 3D capabilities that address critical missions such as GPS-denied navigation, digital twin simulations, synthetic and real-world training environments, autonomous vehicle routing and telecommunications network planning. We believe that creating standard products using this technology will grow our product-based revenue with customers in the technology, defense and intelligence, civil government and global development organization sectors.
​
Expanding our relationship with the U.S. government—The U.S. government is the largest customer of our Earth Intelligence segment through the EOCL Contract, G-EGD and OWT programs and various classified and unclassified contract vehicles. Demand for geospatial intelligence and services continues to grow given the geopolitical environment 

11



and the confluence of high-performance computing and ML algorithms that allow for insights to be extracted from ever greater levels of data being produced by Earth observation sensors and national and commercial satellite assets. The U.S. government has expressed interest in increasingly relying on commercial partners to harness the rapid pace of commercial innovation more effectively, including the continued use of geospatial data given cost affordability and advances in technology that provide high-quality imagery. We seek to grow our business with the U.S. government by leveraging the investments we have made across our capability set, including in AI and ML and our strong record of historic performance.
​
Growing our installed base and penetration of international defense and intelligence customers—We currently provide service to U.S.-allied nations through our DAP, RAP, SecureWatch and Precision-3D products. These customers use our imagery in their civil and intelligence related missions. Our imagery and services are either complementary to national assets owned by these countries, or in some cases defer the need for a country to invest in owned and operated national assets. We believe there are many prospective customers that have both the mission need and budget for our services which we seek to add to our installed base. We also seek to further penetrate existing customers through the provision of additional data and services. Lastly, we believe there are opportunities to provide our services to U.S. allied nations who might seek a complement to national capabilities in geospatial analytics. Our strategy focuses on those countries that currently have deep and longstanding relationships with our Earth Intelligence segment and other close U.S. allies.
​
Growing with and expanding our installed base among enterprise customers—We have over 500 enterprise customers that use our data in their products and applications across a variety of industries including technology, telecommunications, transportation, mining, mapping, social media and oil and gas. The confluence of high-performance computing and ML algorithms are allowing for insights to be extracted from ever greater quantities of imagery and meta data, which in turn is driving innovation across our customer base. We expect this trend to continue, and we seek to grow with our existing customers as well as to grow our installed base in new industry verticals by leveraging our sector leading imagery capabilities. Furthermore, we believe our capabilities in AI and ML, 3D and Big Data Analytics products will position us to sell additional solutions and services to our commercial customers.
​
Providing products that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning—AI and ML enable us to extract greater insight from our geospatial data to deliver actionable intelligence to our customers. We have continued to refine and improve our approach to AI and ML, which benefit from our large volumes of historical training data and high-quality imagery. Our recent acquisition of Wovenware Inc. exemplifies this approach. Productization of our AI/ML capability will enable delivery of higher value, enriched geospatial data that we expect will facilitate deeper penetration of the U.S. government, international governments and commercial markets.
​
Delivering 3D products to global defense, intelligence and commercial customers—We are expanding the demand for global-scale 3D products. 3D products allow decision-makers to understand their operational environment in 3D – developing new insights that enable them to make better, faster decisions. We see a growing opportunity to sell 3D data and software products to the military and intelligence community to support virtual training environments and provide better information to the warfighter. U.S. and allied defense and intelligence customers are seeking solutions to support intelligence fusion, maneuver and other mission requirements. We also see significant opportunity with our commercial customers as they look for more accurate 3D geodata to deliver their products through new mediums like AR and VR. Additionally, we have entered into license arrangements related to certain consumer applications. The current investment in 5G networks and Internet of Things provides a unique opportunity to deliver network operators a better data solution to improve their future networks. Additional use cases continue to grow as 3D products and precision data-sets become better understood.
​
Space Infrastructure
Driving revenue through improvement in our products and manufacturing and program capabilities—We are developing differentiated capabilities that are designed for future space exploration, including propulsion, power and robotics. We believe these elements will be critical to helping our customers operate in an increasingly contested space environment and in achieving successful space exploration missions. We are also developing our satellite architectures and manufacturing capabilities as we strive to assure that we can successfully fulfill both government and commercial 

12



customer requirements on future programs, including high volume / low mix and variable volume / high mix programs. We plan to team with providers of digital payload technology to enhance our offering if our customers express interest in it. We are also developing relationships across the supply chain to assure that we can seamlessly provide a broad breadth of mission sets to our customers. Finally, we are working to transform our operations (e.g., location strategy, workforce shaping, technology and systems investment and Cost Accounting Standard / Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) compliance) so that we can address a larger set of opportunities across our government and commercial customers.
​
Growing our U.S. and international civil exposure—We have a long history with civil space programs dating back to the Apollo missions. Current NASA programs include the Power and Propulsion Element for the Lunar Gateway, OSAM-1, Psyche and TEMPO. We have also built robotic arms on six of NASA’s Mars rovers and landers. We seek to leverage our investments and expertise in propulsion, power and robotics, as well as our strong legacy of performance, when pursuing further civil work in the U.S. and abroad.
​
Deepening our penetration of U.S. national programs—To date, we have won several classified and unclassified study contracts with U.S. defense and intelligence customers. We seek to further penetrate these markets by utilizing our flexible satellite architectures, design and engineering capabilities and commercial business practices—all of which we believe can create compelling value propositions.
​
Providing flexible platforms to our commercial customers—We currently provide components, subsystems and system architectures to our customers for communications and Earth observation satellites in LEO, MEO and GEO. In communications, we offer flexible platforms across various architecture platforms and mission payloads from standard analog to high throughput, and we are investing in digital systems. In Earth observation, we also offer flexible solutions across various architecture platforms and mission payloads, including electro-optical. Our goal is to be positioned well to compete for future single satellite or full constellation build orders from our customers, across a wide range of the architectures, payloads or Earth orbit chosen to fulfill mission requirements.
​
Government Contracts and Compliance with Government Regulations
​
Our operations are heavily regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws. Our operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant government regulation. We contract with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including branches of the U.S. military and NASA. We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other governments’ contracts, including foreign governments. Compliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in material adverse effects on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. In addition, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in limitations on, or the suspension or revocation of, our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any government policy changes, which may be substantial, could increase regulatory uncertainty. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. In addition, the manner in which regulations or legislation in these areas may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional information about the government regulations affecting our business and the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
U.S. Government Contracts
​
All of our reportable segments have contracts with various governmental entities, which are concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The U.S. government may terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EOCL Contract with the U.S. government in our Earth Intelligence segment, at any time with or without cause. In May 2022, the NRO awarded us a 10-year contract, inclusive of a 5-year base contract as part of the EOCL Contract. The EOCL Contract transitioned the imagery acquisition requirements previously addressed by the EnhancedView Contract and replaces the scope of the EnhancedView Contract with respect to such requirements. While the imagery acquisition portion of the EnhancedView Contract has moved to EOCL, we will continue to perform other awarded services on the 

13



EnhancedView Contract through 2025, concurrent with the new EOCL Contract. The opportunity to increase services beyond the awarded amount is also built into the EOCL Contract. Any changes in the size, scope or term of the EOCL Contract could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our U.S. government contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments, along with all other contracts with the U.S. government, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process and as a result, the U.S. government may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary U.S. government contracts would materially reduce our revenue and adversely impact our operating results and competitive position.
​
Foreign Operations
​
Our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties in the event we fail to meet such requirements.
​
Environmental Regulations
​
Our operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have infrastructure in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We do not believe that the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results or competitive position. The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations or a determination that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances at our sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. We have been designated, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. There can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future, or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites at which no problem is currently known.
​
Resources
​
Intellectual Property
​
We own a substantial intellectual property portfolio that includes many U.S. and foreign patents, as well as many U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We actively pursue internal development of intellectual property. In addition to our patent portfolio, we own other intellectual property such as unpatented trade secrets, know-how, data and software. Additionally, we rely on licenses of certain intellectual property to conduct our business operations, including certain proprietary rights to and from third parties. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our operations, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss, expiration or termination would have a material effect on our business.
​
Raw Materials
​
Our businesses are generally engaged in limited manufacturing activities and have minimal near-term exposure to fluctuations in the supply of raw materials. For those businesses that manufacture and sell products and systems, most of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as third-party suppliers and subcontractors. Certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials or specialty component parts; occasionally, we have experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies 

14



required in our manufacturing processes. As we have several firm fixed price contracts, we bear some risk to supply chain delivery issues and price increases.
​
Research and Development
​
We have a history of investing in development of technological advancements in our field of aerospace. We have both internally and externally funded research and development projects. Our current and future business is dependent on developing new enhancements and technology that go into our existing and future products and services. Our annual research and development expenses from continuing operations were $40 million in 2022, $27 million in 2021 and $15 million in 2020. We intend to continue our focus on research and development and product and service enhancements as a key strategy for innovation and growth. One of our current areas of focus is our development of the WorldView Legion program, a capital project, and other new offerings within our Earth Intelligence segment, including 3D technology. In our Space Infrastructure segment, we are also focused on the further development of components to be used in a variety of our products. Our efforts will continue to be directed into fields that we believe offer the greatest opportunities for long-term growth and profitability. 
​
Human Capital 
​
We endeavor to cultivate a positive employee experience as we deliver on Maxar and customer missions by attracting, engaging and growing current and future Maxar team members; creating strong partnerships across the business; championing culture and fostering an inclusive and diverse environment; and impacting the broader community. We take great pride in our values: 
​
​
Behind the words are leaders, managers and team members who believe in our values and live by them. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 4,600 team members globally of which 95.3% are U.S. based and 4.7% are international. Within the U.S., no team members are unionized, while in Europe a small number of team members are represented by a trade union. Additionally, Maxar employs a highly technical workforce, with 64.2% of our U.S. employees working in technical roles as defined by technical occupations in engineering and information technology. All of these roles require deep technical specialization and knowledge, as well as managers, directors and executives who oversee technical employees and the development and delivery of technical products.
​
Attracting Talent
​
The success of Maxar’s business depends largely on our ability to attract, engage and grow a diverse population of talented technical and skilled team members at all levels. To succeed in highly competitive labor markets and for skill sets that are scarce in the market, we have developed talent acquisition, total rewards and team member engagement strategies, to achieve and maintain a competitive position.
​
Total Rewards
​
Our employee rewards programs are designed to provide an innovative, equitable, competitive, sustainable and scalable package that allows us to compete for and retain top talent in our industry and markets, aligned with Maxar’s business and strategic objectives.
​

We strive to offer comprehensive benefits at a highly competitive cost-share to U.S. team members, including health insurance, direct round-the-clock access to doctors virtually and on-site, an array of targeted wellbeing programs, paid and unpaid leave, parental leave for all new parents for birth or adoption, retirement, life and disability programs, voluntary benefit options flexible to individual team member and family needs, tuition reimbursement, student loan forgiveness, adoption reimbursement, pet insurance and enhanced mental and emotional health support.
​
In order to encourage our value “We Act Like Owners”, we offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan with a discount for team members in countries where it is practical to offer the program. We also offer short- and long-term incentive programs to eligible team members.
​
Outside of the U.S., we provide benefits, retirement and time-off in countries where we have a meaningful population of team members, designed based upon, among other things, market-specific practices and culture alignment.
​
Engaging Talent
​
Our culture at Maxar is designed to enable our team members to do their most meaningful work through innovative, adaptable, and unmatched experiences. We focus on attracting and retaining the right talent for Maxar to drive future business outcomes and enrich the experience by enabling our people grow to and develop as individuals. We regularly seek to engage team members in an ongoing dialogue through town-halls, surveys, quarterly check-ins and listening sessions. We focus on topics including Maxar strategy and business updates, understanding leadership effectiveness, communications clarity, and other areas for improvements. All employees are encouraged to recognize each other and celebrate successes through our STAR recognition program. 
​
In 2022, we implemented a new learning management system, through Workday Learning, which provides a centralized, streamlined platform for employees to access learning content and offerings provided by Maxar. This platform, with over 8,500 pieces of learning content makes learning more accessible to the whole of the organization.
Maxar equips our managers to engage their teams more effectively by offering live, in-person training as well as self-direct on demand training. Catalyst and Ignite, our cohort-based leadership development programs, provide people managers with curriculum topics that include a focus on competencies tied to personal grit, team engagement and accountability and results. Spark, a new addition to Maxar’s leadership development offerings, is a self-paced, self-directed leadership development preparation tool. Based in the Maxar Leadership Framework, Spark is a 10-hour program for individual contributors.
With a focus on retention and filling critical positions, we have dedicated efforts towards awareness across Maxar of our open positions. We promote internal mobility, growth through career opportunities and developmental roles. We also encourage employee referrals for critical roles knowing referrals are the number one source of hires. 
​
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
​
As a purpose-driven organization built on our values, our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (“DIB”) strategy is to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging. We know that our greatest strength comes from our team members. When our team members feel like they belong and their opinions are respected, everyone can perform to their greatest potential.
The DIB strategy is a three-pronged approach that informs and guides us in this journey to:

● | Build a diverse, high-performing workforce by focusing on increasing diverse candidates in early career roles and in technical positions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Foster a culture of inclusion and belonging by growing inclusive leaders and increasing cultural awareness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2022, to focus on attracting and retaining female and nonbinary technical talent, we became partners with AnitaB.org and attended the Grace Hopper Celebration. Through the partnership, we provided AnitaB.org memberships to our team members focusing on mentorship. Additionally, we invited female and nonbinary technologists to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration which provided networking and professional development opportunities. 
 ​
We also continue to focus on increasing the number of diverse candidates in director-level and above leadership roles. For director-level and above roles, we are striving to ensure that a diverse slate of candidates, including at least one female and one ethnically diverse, disabled or veteran candidate, is presented. We have a goal to ensure a diverse slate for 50% or more of our director-level and above leadership roles. In 2022, 75% of open requisitions met the diverse slate requirement and 50% of the positions were filled by diverse candidates.
 ​
To foster a culture of inclusion and belonging, we launched a new Global Inclusion Course to all team members to raise awareness of implicit bias and teach the foundations of what it takes to be inclusive within a complex, diverse global working environment. 
 ​
Maxar continues to be committed to making progress on this journey and will stay curious and focused on cultivating an inclusive environment that promotes and values diversity, inclusion and belonging. Maxar, as a values-based company, makes this a priority, not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it makes Maxar stronger.
