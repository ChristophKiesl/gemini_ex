Item 1. | Business

We are an 138-year-old media enterprise with interests in television and radio broadcasting, as well as local and national digital media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is "Give light and the people will find their own way." Our mission is to do well by doing good — providing value to customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses through a portfolio of television, radio and digital media brands. Scripps is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups, with 33 television stations in 24 markets and a reach of nearly one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the "Big 4" television networks. We also own 34 radio stations in eight markets. We operate an expanding collection of local and national digital journalism and information businesses including our podcast business, Midroll, the multi-platform humor and satire brand, Cracked, and over-the-top ("OTT") video news service, Newsy. We also produce television programming, run an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation's largest, most successful and longest-running educational program, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our media companies and their associated websites, visit http://www.scripps.com.
On April 1, 2015, Scripps and Journal Communications, Inc. ("Journal") closed the merger of their broadcast operations and spin-off of their newspaper businesses into a separate publicly traded company. Upon completion of the transactions, Scripps shareholders received 0.25 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group for each share of Scripps stock. A $60 million special cash dividend, which was approximately $1.00 per share, was also paid to the Scripps shareholders. Journal shareholders received 0.195 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group and 0.5176 class A common shares of Scripps for each share of Journal stock. 
We have a commitment to developing our digital media business and have combined all of our digital initiatives into a single organization. Under the direction of our digital leadership, this focus allows us to find new and efficient platforms for bringing together advertisers and audiences. 
We continued the expansion of our digital business through two acquisitions in 2016. On April 12, 2016 we acquired the multi-platform humor and satire brand Cracked, which informs and entertains millennial audiences with a website, original digital video, social media and a popular podcast. This acquisition provides an opportunity to expand our OTT footprint for both video and audio. The purchase price was $39 million in cash. On June 6, 2016 we acquired Stitcher, a popular podcast listening service which facilitates discovery and streaming for more than 65,000 podcasts for a $4.5 million cash purchase price.
On July 22, 2015, we acquired Midroll Media, a company that creates original podcasts and operates a network that sells advertising for more than 200 shows, including “WTF with Marc Maron" and "Comedy Bang! Bang!” The purchase price was $50 million in cash, plus a $10 million earnout provision. 
On June 16, 2014, we acquired two television stations owned by Granite Broadcasting Corporation for $110 million in cash. The acquisition included an ABC-affiliated station in Buffalo and a MyNetworkTV affiliate in Detroit that is now operated as a duopoly with our ABC affiliate. 
On January 1, 2014, we acquired Media Convergence Group, which operates as Newsy, a video news provider, for $35 million in cash. Newsy adds a new dimension to our video news strategy with a storytelling approach, specifically geared toward OTT audiences.

TELEVISION
Scripps has operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when it launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately 18% of the nation’s television households and includes 15 ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates, two CBS affiliates and four non big-four affiliated stations. We also own five Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. In five of our markets, we operate both television and radio stations. Multiple properties in the same market help us to better serve advertisers, viewers and listeners and help improve our operating efficiencies. 
We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages local and national communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.
We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. 
In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and internally produced programming. We have implemented a strategy to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with internally developed programming. We believe this strategy has the potential to improve our television division's financial performance for years to come. We currently air three original shows, The List, The Now, and RightThisMinute. The List is an Emmy award winning infotainment show. The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day's events. RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. We wholly own The List and The Now and are a partner in RightThisMinute. These three shows have replaced expensive syndicated content in the markets in which they air. For the 2016-2017 season, The List was available in 45 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country, The Now was available in more than 10 of our markets and RightThisMinute reached 94% of the nation's television households.

Revenue cycles and sources
Advertising
We sell advertising to local, national and political customers. The sale of local, national and political commercial spots accounted for 71% of our television segment’s revenues in 2016. Pricing of advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our television stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.
Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. 
National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and national retailers. 
Political advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, senate and house of representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to Political Action Groups or other advocacy groups.
Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.
Advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising preceding the presidential election. Because of the political election cyclicality, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance of even-numbered years to odd numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number and importance of individual political races and issues discussed. 
Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.
Retransmission Revenues
We earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors ("MVPDs") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 28% of our television segment's revenues in 2016. The MVPDs are cable operators and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market. 
Prior to the 2008 spin-off of Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), we granted retransmission rights to MVPDs in exchange for carriage of cable networks. Pursuant to an agreement entered into as part of the spin-off, SNI currently pays us an annual fee for carriage of our broadcast signals by Comcast, limited to the television stations owned prior to the 2008 spin-off. The fees paid by SNI are substantially less than current retransmission fees that would be paid by MVPDs. This agreement with SNI expires at the end of 2019, when we expect to renew our retransmission agreement with Comcast for all of our current markets. 

There are approximately 17 million subscribers to MVPD services in our markets. Our current subscriber count is based on information received this year upon renewals with certain MVPD providers who previously were not required to provide such information while the retransmission rights were tied to carriage of SNI programming. We do not believe there has been a meaningful year-over-year change in the number of subscribers in our markets. 
Our retransmission consent agreements with MVPD providers expire at various dates through 2020. The approximate number of subscribers to those services by year of expiration is as follows: 1 million in 2017, 6 million in 2018, 7 million in 
7

2019 and 3 million in 2020. We expect our retransmission consent agreements with MVPD providers to be renewed upon expiration.
Other
FCC rules allow broadcasters to transmit additional digital channels within the spectrum allocated to each FCC license holder. This provides viewers with additional programming alternatives at no additional cost to them. With these additional channels we broadcast our own programs or programming of other providers such as Grit, Laff, Escape and Bounce. We may consider other alternative programming formats that we could air using our spectrum with the goal of achieving higher profits and community service.
In addition to selling commercials during our programming, we also offer marketing opportunities for our business customers, including sponsorships and community events.
Expenses
Employee costs accounted for 46% of segment costs and expenses in 2016.
We have been centralizing certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities.
Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 29% of total segment costs and expenses in 2016. 
Our network-affiliated stations pay the networks for the programming that is supplied to us in various dayparts. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.
RADIO
We own 34 radio stations in eight markets. We operate 28 FM stations and six AM stations. 
We employ a variety of sales-related and programming strategies to maximize our share of the advertising spending. We have aligned our radio stations in clusters within a market, building each cluster around a lead station. We seek to create unique and differentiated brand positions at each station within a cluster so that we can offer distinct solutions for a variety of advertisers in each of our markets. This approach has allowed us to target our stations' formats and sales efforts to better serve advertisers and listeners, as well as leverage operating expenses to maximize the performance of each station and the cluster. 
Our radio stations focus on providing targeted and relevant local programming that is responsive to the interest of the communities in which we serve, strengthening our brand identity and allowing us to provide effective marketing solutions for advertisers by reaching their targeted audiences.
Our Milwaukee radio station, WTMJ-AM, currently maintains exclusive radio broadcast rights for the Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Brewers and operates a network broadcast for their games.

Revenue sources
Advertising
The primary source of revenue for our radio stations is from the sale of advertising to local advertisers. We also sell non-traditional advertising, which includes initiatives to attract new local advertisers, such as the creation of new content and programs that combine television or radio with digital, national and political advertising. Although it is not as significant as in the television segment, our radio stations may benefit from political advertising in even numbered years. 
We strive to maximize revenue dollars through the broadcast of commercials without diminishing listening levels. While the number of advertisements broadcast during a given time period may vary, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year, unless there has been a format change.
Other
Other revenue includes the sports affiliation fees we receive at WTMJ-AM for the network broadcast of the Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Brewers. We also offer marketing opportunities for our customers, including sponsorships and community events. 
Expenses
Employee costs accounted for 50% of segment costs and expenses in 2016. 
Programming costs, which are comprised primarily of music license fees and sports rights fees, were 20% of total segment costs and expenses in 2016. We pay music license fees to performing rights organizations which allows us to broadcast music. The sports rights fees include the costs for our exclusive rights to broadcast the Green Bay Packers and Milwaukee Brewers. 
Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television and radio are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children's television programming and limiting commercial content therein, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting. 
Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee's performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.
FCC regulations govern the ownership of radio and television stations and other media. Under the FCC's current rules, a license for a television station will generally not be granted or renewed if the grant of the license would result in (i) the applicant owning or controlling more than one television station, or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations in the same market (the “television duopoly rule”), or (ii) the applicant owning or controlling television stations whose total national audience reach exceeds 39% of all television households. The Company enjoys a waiver of this television duopoly rule in the Green Bay, Wisconsin market. 
A television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming will be deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. The FCC in 2016 reaffirmed a 2014 decision to modify its ownership rules so as to impose this duopoly rule's restriction on separately-owned television stations within a market that engage in joint advertising sales. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station that would be subject to this requirement except that, in accord with a congressional directive, the FCC’s order grants such stations a “grandfathered” status that will permit continuation of these 
10

agreements without attribution through 2025. This order also imposed on local stations that share facilities or services such as program production an obligation to disclose these agreements in their public files. Each of stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, is a party to a shared services agreement with another local station pursuant to which it provides, among other services, less than 15% of the other station’s weekly programming. This disclosure requirement, however, is not yet in effect, and the entire 2016 ownership order is now subject to both reconsideration by the FCC and review by an appellate court.
The FCC’s local radio ownership rule limits the number of radio stations an entity may own in a given market depending on the size of that radio market. Specifically, in a radio market with 45 or more commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own or control up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM). In a radio market with between 30 and 44 radio stations, a party may own or control up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service. In a radio market with between 15 and 29 radio stations, a party may own or control up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service. In a radio market with 14 or fewer radio stations, a party may own or control up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service, except that a party may not own or control more than 50% of the stations in the market, except for combinations of one AM and one FM station. The FCC relies on Nielsen to define the radio market in most areas of the country, but for stations outside a Nielsen-defined market this definition depends upon a technical analysis of the stations’ service areas. A radio station that provides more than 15% of another in-market station’s weekly programming or sells more than 15% of another in-market station’s weekly advertising will be deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the ownership rule limits.
The FCC’s radio-television cross-ownership rule separately limits broadcast ownership, generally allowing: common ownership of one or two television stations and up to six radio stations, or, in certain circumstances, one television station and seven radio stations in any market where at least 20 independent voices would remain after the combination; two television stations and up to four radio stations in a market where at least 10 independent voices would remain after the combination; and one television and one radio station notwithstanding the number of independent voices in the market. A “voice” under this rule generally includes independently owned and locally-received commercial and noncommercial broadcast television and radio stations, significant local newspapers, and one local cable system.
The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws. 
The FCC routinely reviews its ownership rules, and its decisions are then subject to judicial review. We cannot predict the outcome of the ongoing review of the FCC’s most recent reconsideration of these ownership issues or the effect of any FCC revision of these ownership policies on our stations' operations or our business.
In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, Congress granted the FCC authority to conduct an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters have agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into the reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air service. Broadcasters also are concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans do not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use and that there will not be adequate compensation for those stations that are required to change facilities due to repacking. Implementing the post-auction changes in stations' frequencies and tower site locations may be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders are at particular risk of service loss and difficulty in finding alternative transmitter sites due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about potential difficulties, such as a lack of available qualified tower crews for the significant number of moves that may be required, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.
The FCC is considering a proposal that would allow broadcasters to voluntarily use a new digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. Broadcasters expect that adoption of this proposal would permit stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception--particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 would be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current digital standard to simulcast (on a subchannel) one of the switching station’s free program streams.

The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC has decided to further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business. 
Broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations. 
Former FCC Chairman Wheeler announced in 2016 that the Commission would not actively proceed with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith.” Nevertheless, a related agency proceeding remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC's processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.
Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. This proceeding raises a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.
Radio station revenues are subject to the regulatory decisions of the Copyright Royalty Board (“CRB”) which sets rates for broadcasters’ royalty payments to music copyright holders for the performance of their works. Whether radio stations should also pay royalties to music performers is a long-standing and controversial topic before Congress. We cannot predict the impact that future decisions of the CRB or Congress with respect to these matters might have upon our radio stations’ revenues or their possible impact on the Company.
During recent years, the FCC has significantly increased the penalties it imposes for violations of its rules and policies. For example, a recent settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC's authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as broadcasting proper emergency alerts and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.

DIGITAL
Our digital segment includes a collection of local and national digital brands. The local brands consist of our local television and radio station websites, as well as the related smartphone and tablet apps, which earn revenues from advertising sales and related digital advertising products and marketing services. Our local digital sites offer comprehensive local news, information and user-generated content, as well as national content and other content sources. We continue to enhance our online and digital services using features such as long-form text articles in addition to streaming video and audio, to deliver news and information. Many of our journalists routinely produce videos for consumption through our digital platforms and use an array of social media sites, such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, to communicate with and build our audiences. We have embraced mobile technology by offering our products on apps available on the Apple, Android, Kindle Fire and Windows platforms. During the fourth quarter of 2016 our local markets served 262 million page views and had an average of 24.9 million unique users; we had approximately 960,000 monthly active users of our local, mobile and tablet apps; and combined, our local websites and mobile products delivered approximately 156 million video views.
The national digital brands compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where audience and revenue growth are the fastest, such as over-the-top (OTT) audio and video. OTT refers to the delivery of audio, video and other media over the Internet through third parties such as Hulu, Netflix, HBO NOW and Sling TV. Consumers can access the OTT content through internet-connected devices such as computers, gaming consoles (such as PlayStation or Xbox), set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. A podcast is a digital audio recording, usually part of a themed series, which can be downloaded from the Internet to a media player or computer. Both OTT video and audio-podcasting platforms enable us to expand our reach and number of viewers beyond that of our local audience and also enable us to attract a variety of different advertisers. 
Our national digital brands include Cracked, Newsy and Midroll Media (Midroll). Cracked is a multi-platform humor and satire brand which informs and entertains millennial audiences with a website, original digital video, social media and a popular podcast. During 2016, there was an average of 11 million unique visitors per month to Cracked.com and since its acquisition in June of this year, there was an average of 18 million video views per month on YouTube. Additionally, as of the end of 2016, Cracked had 3.8 million Facebook fans. Newsy is an OTT video news service focused on the millennial generation that brings perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. Newsy's content is distributed on ten platforms providing OTT video services, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. During 2016, Newsy experienced 74% year-over-year video streaming growth and users had an average engagement time of 27 minutes. Another national digital brand, Midroll, is a podcast industry leader that creates original podcasts and operates a network that generates revenue for more than 200 shows, with on-air talent such as Marc Maron and Bill Simmons. Midroll is the parent company of the popular podcast listening platform, Stitcher, and the premium subscription service, Howl, which operates through a smartphone app that makes it easier to find and engage with podcasts. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Midroll's podcasts were downloaded an average of 91 million times per month.
Revenue sources
Digital advertising
Our local and national digital operations earn revenue primarily through the sale of advertising to local and national customers. Digital advertising includes fixed-duration campaigns whereby, for a fee, a video preroll, a banner, text or other advertisement appears for a specified period of time; impression-based campaigns where the fee is based on the number of times the advertisement appears in webpages viewed by a user; and click-through campaigns where the fee is based on the number of users who click on an advertisement and are directed to the advertisers’ websites. We use a variety of audience-extension programs to enhance the reach of our websites and garner a larger share of advertising dollars that are spent online. 
Another source of advertising revenue comes from our national digital brand Midroll. Midroll earns revenue from the sale of advertisement spots on its original podcasts which it creates and distributes through its owned-and-operated network, Earwolf, as well as on platforms such as the Stitcher app and the Apple iTunes app.
Other
Other revenue sources primarily include digital marketing, podcast agency and subscription services. 
We offer our local advertising customers additional marketing services, such as managing their search engine marketing campaigns. Additionally, Midroll acts as a sales and marketing representative by working with advertisers to connect them to a specific podcast based on the advertiser's desired target audience.

The primary source of subscription revenue comes from Howl, which is a subscription service launched by Midroll in August 2015, where users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes. In December 2016, Midroll launched the Stitcher Premium subscription service, which includes Howl, on the Stitcher platform.
Expenses
Employee costs accounted for 60% of segment costs and expenses in 2016.
Other segment costs and expenses in 2016 were attributable to news coverage costs, network and digital hosting costs and other miscellaneous expenses.
Syndication and Other
Syndication and other primarily includes the syndication of news features and comics and other features for the newspaper industry.
