Background
 
Shengda Network Technology, Inc. (formerly known as “Soltrest, Inc.”) (the “Company”) was incorporated on March 14, 2018 in the State of Nevada. On March 30, 2020, we filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation changing our name to “Shengda Network Technology, Inc.”
 
On April 20, 2020, we purchased 100% of the shares of Peaker International Trade Group Limited (Hong Kong) (“Peaker”) for a total purchase price of US$1,330. Peaker presently owns 100% of Zhejiang Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd., which is located in Zhejiang province, China. Thereafter, on May 15, 2020, Peaker incorporated in China a 100%-owned subsidiary, Zhejiang Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd. (China) which is intended to serve as an operating company in China for our activities in China.
 
Description of Product or Services
 
We provide portals (similar to Amazon, Inc.) for the sale of products offered by reliable manufacturers and merchants at competitive prices. Products run the gamut from electronics to daily consumable products, food and clothing.
 
Target Market and Clients/Potential Clients
 
Our current target market is China. The products supplied through our channels are high-quality and readily available products offered by a significant number of registered companies to members on our sales portals. At this date, we have over 500,000 registered and active members. We also do online market promotion through our online shopping malls and membership networks, word of mouth and social media such as WeChat. We also intend to offer products through offline stores and customer service centers. It is our goal to build the strongest Internet shopping channel in China.
 
During the initial phase of our development, our main target clients are individual users that browse internet on a daily basis. In Phase 2 of our business development, we plan to provide services and product to small size companies. Finally, if we see success with smaller companies, we would then intend to offer our products to medium sized corporations.
 
Source of Revenue
 
We have identified three main marketing client groups associated with the various streams of revenue:
 
Source #1 – Individual PC or other internet enabled device users with WebMall Sales and Service - Today several billion people use personal computers or other internet enabled devices. Capturing a small sector of this user population could allow us to sell our products and services at a very attractive and affordable prices.
Source #2 – Small companies.
 
Source #3 – Medium sized companies
 
Growth Strategy
 
In the near term, we will provide services to a variety of locales in China. Zhejiang is the center of China and we have estimated that 80% of our members are in Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Anhui, Fujian and other provinces.
 
Once we have a core of business in China, we plan to expand to Southeast Asia, Europe and Latin America in over the next five to six years.

Competition
 
Currently, our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have just recently started our operations. There are currently in the market larger and better-financed companies providing similar services.
 
The online sales industry is highly competitive. We compete with other numerous other firms, including larger regional, national and international firms that may have financial, operational, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Among these competitors are Amazon, Inc., Alibaba, Jingdong, and PinDuoDuo. Competitive factors include the level of technical expertise and experience, industry reputation, quality of work, price, geographic presence, dependability, availability of skilled personnel and financial stability. Our management believes that we can compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that our business model provides certain competitive advantages:
 

● | Offering free membership to consumers who utilize our services, including preferential shipping; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Offering a sharing of the economic benefits by offering discounts and rebates to regular customers; and 
● | Providing superior customer services through all sales portals and physical locations. 

Employees
 
As of September 28, 2021, we had ten employees, all of which were full-time.
 
Uncertainties Facing the Company
 
As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate additional revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund to keep operation, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, as of the time of the filing of this Report, many states in the United States are still experiencing high rates of infection and many countries around the world, including the United States and China, have taken steps to restrict travel. The existence of a worldwide pandemic, the fear associated with COVID-19, or any, pandemic, and the reactions of governments in response to COVID-19, or any, pandemic, to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the markets in which we operate. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
