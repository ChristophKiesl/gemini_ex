Overview 
 Veritone, Inc. (collectively with our subsidiaries, referred to as “Veritone,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) is a provider of artificial intelligence (“AI”) computing solutions. We are driven by the belief that AI is key to building a safer, more vibrant, transparent and empowered society.  Our mission is to be an active contributor to making the world better through AI.
 Today, over 80% of new data created worldwide is unstructured, which is increasing at an annual growth rate of 30-60% per year, according to Gartner (2020 Strategic Roadmap for Storage, July 1, 2020). This creates significant challenges for companies and governments across the globe – specifically, how to create systematic solutions to address the ever-increasing volume of unstructured data.  Whether it is a local police department trying to rapidly solve crimes through analysis of video evidence, a media company searching years of television archives for specific images and video content, or the U.S. military trying to analyze huge volumes of satellite and other aerial images, we believe AI is the only efficient solution to these complex challenges.  
 To address the ever-growing challenges surrounding unstructured data, we developed aiWARE™, our proprietary AI operating system.  aiWARE orchestrates machine learning algorithms, or AI models, together with a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our multi-faceted aiWARE platform offers capabilities that mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, prediction, problem solving and optimization, enabling users to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data, and analyze and optimize data to drive business processes and insights. 
 aiWARE is based on an open architecture that enables new AI models, applications and workflows to be added quickly and efficiently, resulting in a future proof, scalable and evolving solution that can be easily leveraged by organizations in a broad range of industries that capture or use audio, video and other unstructured data, together with structured data, such as the media and entertainment, government, legal and compliance, energy and other vertical markets, driving down the cost, complexity and time to develop, deploy and distribute AI-enabled applications in their operations. Our aiWARE platform is offered primarily through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) delivery model and can be deployed in a number of environments and configurations to meet customers’ needs.
 We believe the opportunity to create a sustainable and growing business around AI and AI-enabled solutions is large and growing significantly.  According to Omdia (Artificial Intelligence Software Market Forecast, 2020), the AI market today is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35%, to reach $100.0 billion in 2025.  We believe that our current solutions address opportunities in intelligent process automation, machine learning operations and AI platform and developer tools, which markets are expected to total approximately $34.5 billion by 2025.

In particular, we believe that there are tremendous near and long term opportunities to grow our business in the government and energy markets.  According to Bloomberg Government (BGOV) (Fiscal 2021 Government Contracting Playbook, 2020), the U.S. Government is preparing to invest more than $6 billion in AI-related research and development projects in fiscal 2021. The U.S. General Services Administration’s Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence and the U.S. Department of Defense’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center have been created to speed the adoption of AI technologies by civilian and defense agencies, respectively, and the U.S. Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs have opened their own AI research offices. Meanwhile, federal contract spending on AI is on pace to grow by almost 50%, according to BGOV projections, reaching $3.0 billion in fiscal 2021.  In the energy market, according to Frost and Sullivan (Growth Opportunities from Decarbonization in the Global Power Market, 2019-2030), it is estimated that $3.4 trillion will be invested in renewable energy over the next 10 years.  We believe that the applicability of our AI solutions will extend beyond utilities and across the global $1.5 trillion electric energy market (inspirecleanenergy.com, Understanding the Energy Market, March 2017), including improved optimization to reduce energy production lost, which we have estimated to be over $21 billion in the U.S. annually over the last 10 years based on data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (Frequently Asked Questions, https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/index.php).
We have expanded and enhanced our aiWARE SaaS solutions and services through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies.  Through our acquisition of Wazee Digital, Inc. (“Wazee Digital”) in 2018, we added to our offerings digital asset management solutions and digital content licensing services.  We have integrated the cognitive functionality of aiWARE with these Wazee Digital solutions and services, which allows us to provide our customers with unique capabilities to more effectively monetize and enrich their content.  In 2017, we acquired the advanced data analytics software and related intellectual property assets of Atigeo Corporation, including its cooperative distributed inferencing (“CDI”) technology that is based on Hamiltonian models and other proprietary algorithms, adding proprietary AI-based forecasting, optimization and intelligent control capabilities to our growing body of technology and intellectual property in data science.  We have developed solutions utilizing our CDI technology to address a number of use cases, particularly in the energy market, and we have integrated these solutions with aiWARE to deploy, integrate and operate them for customers.  We plan to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies that strengthen our business, enhance our AI capabilities and/or expand our market presence in our core vertical markets or in new markets.
 Leveraging our AI media solutions, we also operate a full service advertising agency, which we expanded in 2018 through our acquisition of S Media Limited, doing business as Performance Bridge Media (“Performance Bridge”), a leading podcast advertising agency, becoming one of the world’s largest full service performance-based audio advertising agencies.  Our services include media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics.  Our advertising business utilizes our aiWARE platform to help our clients improve their advertising placements and maximize the return on their advertising spending using real-time ad verification and analytics, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over other traditional advertising agencies.  
 In late 2019, we launched our VeriAdsTM Network, which enables broadcasters, podcasters and social media influencers to generate incremental advertising revenue from premium advertisers looking to expand their audience reach through new unique ad units and influencers.  The VeriAds Network leverages our aiWARE platform to programmatically manage clearance and verification of ads and to analyze programming content to identify new contextually relevant advertising opportunities.

 Government, Legal and Compliance Markets 
 We have developed AI-powered solutions to address the needs of customers in the government, legal and compliance markets, including law enforcement and other government agencies, legal and judicial professionals, and companies and regulatory bodies in highly regulated industries.  Law enforcement and other government agencies accumulate large amounts 
 5

of unstructured audio and video data on a daily basis, including from police body cameras, police car recorders, interview room cameras, 911 audio tapes and surveillance cameras.  Historically, in most cases, investigators have had to review audio and video data manually in separately siloed systems, a task that consumes huge amounts of time and delays investigations.  In addition, public agencies are required to provide certain information, including in many cases audio and video files, in response to requests from the public.  Recently, statutes in several states have broadened the scope of information required to be disclosed and have shortened the time periods in which such disclosures must be made, and the volume of public information requests received by agencies has increased significantly.  Reviewing video footage to identify and authenticate the appropriate footage to be disclosed, and to redact facial images and other sensitive information from the footage prior to disclosure, have historically been time-consuming and largely manual processes. Today, law enforcement and other government agencies can leverage our aiWARE platform and applications to organize, review, analyze and gain insight from their various data sources to greatly enhance their investigative workflows and to support their public disclosure requirements. 
 Within the legal market, our AI technologies support eDiscovery, the process of identifying, collecting and producing electronically stored information (“ESI”), where audio and video content analysis is playing an increasingly important role in civil litigation and criminal proceedings. Historically, the eDiscovery process has been focused primarily on text-based documents such as emails, and audio and video files have often been excluded from production requirements due to the high cost and complexity involved in automatically identifying relevant keywords, phrases or other details contained therein. Today, legal and judicial professionals must deal with escalating volumes of audio and video content resulting from recorded telephone calls, voice mails, video recordings and other sources in meeting eDiscovery requirements, including statutory requirements that have expanded the types of evidence that must be produced in a case, including electronically created or stored information, and accelerated production timeframes.  Our aiWARE platform’s applications and cognitive capabilities enable users to quickly search and analyze large volumes of audio files, video files, text-based documents and other ESI to identify particular words, phrases, faces, objects and voices, and to redact sensitive information prior to production, greatly increasing the speed, reducing the cost, and improving the results of discovery processes.
 Applications used by our customers in the government, legal and compliance markets include: 
  
• | IDentify. Our IDentify application is a powerful AI-driven tool that enables law enforcement and judicial agencies to increase the speed and efficiency of investigative workflows. IDentify allows users to upload and maintain booking and known offender databases in aiWARE and use facial recognition technology to automatically compare video and photographic evidence, such as footage from body cameras, dash cameras and CCTV surveillance cameras, with these databases to identify potential suspects for further investigation. Users can optionally add detected but unknown faces to a persons of interest database for future digital evidence comparison. IDentify gives agencies a powerful tool to augment their investigative workflows, saving valuable time and resources and helping them solve cases faster. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Illuminate. Our Illuminate application provides users with an effective means of searching voluminous sets of media and electronic documents to support eDiscovery efforts, and particularly their early case assessment efforts. This application allows users to rapidly ingest, process and search large volumes of audio, video, image and text-based documents, to identify and segregate relevant evidence for further review and analysis. Illuminate’s text analytics capabilities allow users to visually explore entities, such as the persons, organizations and locations identified in the data. Once processed and reviewed through the application, users are able to transfer a relevant subset of media and documents to our Redact application if redaction is necessary, or export it for transfer to their eDiscovery or case management platform for further processing and workflows. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Redact. Our Redact application enables law enforcement and judicial agencies to leverage AI to automate the redaction of faces and other sensitive information within audio, video and image-based evidence, significantly streamlining their redaction workflows. Redact employs AI technology to automatically detect when persons appear in evidence for review and selection. Users can also define other sensitive items appearing in video evidence and choose to automatically track the defined items for redaction throughout the video or at a single time stamp. The application then systematically obscures selected portions of the data in the evidence. With Redact, agencies can complete their review and redaction of evidence in a fraction of the amount of time spent on manual processes, freeing up valuable resources while also complying with stringent disclosure requirements.

 We conduct sales and marketing activities relating to our digital content licensing services business through our direct sales representatives, who identify, develop and manage our relationships with strategic customers in the advertising, entertainment/documentary and network broadcasting industries. We maintain our Commerce web portal, where stock content and select libraries can be licensed and downloaded directly, but the majority of our business is driven through high-value libraries that require an approval process in order to gain access. We also cross-sell additional Veritone products and services, including media management and aiWARE, to our content licensor partners.

Advertising 
 We market and sell our advertising services through a combination of our direct sales and indirect channel sales. We primarily market and sell directly to advertisers through outbound sales networking and client and partner referrals. Our indirect sales channel consists of referral partners who are mainly advertising agencies or marketing consultants who are unable to provide certain services to their clients, such as radio, podcast and YouTube placements. In addition to our sales efforts for new clients, we further expand sales opportunities and upsell through our campaign strategists who work directly with our advertising clients to optimize and enhance media spending on advertising campaigns. 
Customers 
 We market and sell our aiWARE SaaS solutions to customers primarily in the media and entertainment, government, legal and compliance, and energy markets. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2020.
 During 2020, ten customers accounted for approximately 53% of the total revenues from our aiWARE SaaS solutions, of which seven customers in the media and entertainment market accounted for approximately 36%, two customers in the government market accounted for approximately 9%, and one customer in the energy market accounted for approximately 8%, of our total revenues from these solutions.  As we continue to grow our revenues from our aiWARE SaaS solutions across our markets, we believe that our dependence on any single customer or group of customers will be minimized.  
 For our advertising services, we target clients that make significant investments in advertising, particularly in native and spot-based advertising campaigns delivered over broadcast radio, satellite audio, streaming audio, podcasting, digital video services and other social media channels. During 2020, ten advertising clients accounted for approximately 58% of the total revenues from our advertising services, with one customer accounting for approximately 15% of the total revenues from these services.  We have continued to grow and diversify our advertising client base over the past few years, which has reduced our dependency on a limited number of large clients.
 For our content licensing services, we target customers such as major sports networks, advertising agencies, and film production companies that require high value content for their broadcasts and projects.  During 2020, ten customers accounted for approximately 38% of the total revenues from our content licensing services. 
 We believe that our relationships with our key customers are good. However, if our key customers discontinue or reduce their business with us, or suffer downturns in their businesses, it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results on a short-term basis. If we lose business from key customers and we are unable to sufficiently expand our customer base to replace the lost business, it would have a long-term negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Competition 
 aiWARE SaaS Solutions. The market for AI-enabled solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with new AI capabilities and solutions introduced by both large established players that target multiple vertical markets or enterprise functions, as well as smaller emerging companies developing point solutions that generally only address a single cognitive category or a specific industry segment.  We believe the following competitive attributes are necessary for us to successfully compete in the AI industry for commercial and government customers for our aiWARE SaaS solutions: 

• | Applications to enable our platform to be effectively leveraged for a wide variety of use cases;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to seamlessly utilize multiple AI models in the same and different classes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Breadth and depth of cognitive processing and other AI capabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of AI models, particularly accuracy and speed;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Availability of cloud-based and on-premises deployment models and functionality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of deployment and integration;
--+------------------------------------


• | Platform scalability, reliability and security; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Cost of deploying and using our products.
--+------------------------------------------

We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We believe that few of our competitors currently compete directly with us across all of our cognitive capabilities and vertical markets, and that none of our competitors currently deploy an AI operating system with an open ecosystem comprised of a comparable number of multiple proprietary and third party AI models that can be accessed by customers from a single integrated platform. 
 Competitors for our aiWARE SaaS solutions fall into the following primary categories: 
  
• | Infrastructure-based cloud computing vendors offering cognitive processing services via APIs, such as IBM Watson via IBM Cloud, Microsoft Cognitive Services via Azure and Amazon Machine Learning via AWS;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smaller AI-focused vendors offering solutions within a single cognitive category such as facial recognition, object recognition, or natural language processing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprise services and solutions providers that combine their services with technology developed in-house to address specific challenges for organizations, such as Palantir and C3.ai;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | System integrators that aggregate and integrate solutions from multiple underlying providers of cognitive services for clients, such as Accenture and Deloitte Consulting; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers of hardware and/or software solutions serving a particular market, which are incorporating into their solutions automated processing, search and/or data analytics capabilities that provide functionality similar to our industry targeted applications, including the following:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the media and entertainment market, providers of digital asset management systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the public safety market, providers of police body cameras and car recorders and associated content storage and management systems; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the legal market, providers of eDiscovery solutions and/or associated hosting and managed services.

 Advertising. Competitors of our advertising services are mainly traditional advertising agencies that are either large full-service agencies or smaller niche agencies with a particular specialization or focus, such as radio media placement or podcast advertising, as well as large consulting firms in the media industry.  We also face competition from clients that have the resources and ability to service their advertising and marketing needs in-house. We believe that we currently are, and will continue to, compete successfully against our competitors on several key factors. We are a leader in endorsed radio and podcast advertising services, and we leverage our platform to provide our clients with innovative technology that we believe provides them with better analytics and insights into their advertising campaigns than our competitors for better advertising performance and optimization. 
 Content Licensing.  We do not currently face significant competition from third parties for our content licensing services, particularly in North America; however, many rights holders manage the licensing of their content in-house, and rights holders that we currently represent may choose to license their own content directly in the future.  As we expand our content licensing services internationally, we believe that we will face greater competition from third parties, including large global events and talent management companies.  We believe that we may also face more competition in North America in the future, as new representation companies emerge or expand their business in the region.  We believe that our ability to use the cognitive capabilities of aiWARE to enrich and enhance the searchability of content, and to leverage relationships with customers and vendors across our aiWARE SaaS and advertising businesses, gives us a competitive advantage over other representation companies and allows us to achieve greater benefits for rights holders than they can achieve through their own in-house efforts. 
 Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and larger intellectual property portfolios. As a result, certain of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In addition, some competitors may offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower prices, with greater depth than our products or geographies where we do not operate. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development organization is comprised of employees who are responsible for the design, development and testing of our AI and software solutions, including software engineers, quality engineers, data scientists, data engineers, product managers and user experience designers.  Our research and development organization is generally organized in teams, with one team focused on our core aiWARE architecture and capabilities and other teams focused on solutions and applications that address specific use cases in our key markets. We focus our efforts on developing new 
 10

features and expanding the core technologies that further enhance the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our platform, as well as allow us to operate in new vertical markets.  In addition, we contract with select third-party engineering services to support development and quality assurance testing.  We plan to continue to make significant investments in developing our AI technologies, expanding the functionality and capabilities of our aiWARE platform and related solutions, and building new software capabilities. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. 
 As of February 28, 2021, in the United States, we had 27 issued patents, which expire between 2027 and 2039, and had 25 patent applications pending for examination. As of such date, we also had nine issued patents and 23 patent applications pending for examination in foreign jurisdictions (including international PCT applications), all of which are related to our U.S. patents and patent applications. In addition, we have registered, or have applied for registration of, numerous trademarks, including Veritone and aiWARE, in the United States and in several foreign jurisdictions.  We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection and other subjects. 
 Our customers utilize our aiWARE SaaS solutions and related services to process, analyze and store data, which may contain personal information that is subject to data protection and privacy laws in various jurisdictions.  For example, in providing certain solutions and related services to customers located in Europe, we are deemed to be a data processor under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  The GDPR applies to all companies processing personal data of EU residents, regardless of the company’s location.  As a result, we are obligated to comply with the GDPR in processing personal data on behalf of our customers.  We must also comply with the GDPR (and similar regulations in other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom) as a data controller with respect to personal data of certain employees and individuals employed or engaged by our current or prospective customers, vendors and service providers, which we receive and process in the course of our business.  We are also required to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the regulations implemented thereunder with respect to personal information of California consumers that we collect and process, both directly and indirectly as a service provider to our customers.  
 Under the GDPR and/or the CCPA, as well as similar data protection regulations implemented in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and in other states within the United States, we are required to maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and protection of personal data and information, and we must comply (either directly or indirectly in support of our customers’ compliance efforts, as provided for in our contracts with customers) with a number of requirements with respect to individuals whose personal data or information we collect and process, including, among others, notification requirements and requirements to comply with requests from individuals to (i) opt out of collection, processing and/or sale of their data or information, (ii) delete their data or information, and (iii) receive copies of and other information regarding our collection and processing of their data or information.
 The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will take effect on January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA to include additional obligations of businesses with respect to collecting, processing and sharing personal information and responding to requests from consumers related to their personal information.  We will be obligated to comply with the CPRA and the regulations to be implemented thereunder commencing in January 2023. 
 Human Capital Resources
 As of February 28, 2021, we had a total of 308 employees, substantially all of which were full-time employees. 
 We believe that our employees are our greatest assets and our company culture is a critical component of our success.  We strive to create a work environment in which all employees feel a strong sense of community and embody our core 
 11

values.  We have implemented a number of initiatives to ensure that our employees are engaged and motivated to work hard, and have fun at the same time.  We conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction, identify areas for improvement and implement positive change in order to evolve and better our company culture.
 We strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. To attract top talent, we strive to offer competitive salaries, incentives, equity compensation and benefits.  We conduct a regular quarterly talent review process, in which we obtain employee feedback, evaluate performance, and establish goals, objectives and development plans for all employees.  We continuously monitor and evaluate employee turnover to identify and address areas of concern to improve employee retention.
