Item 1. Business
Overview
Castlight Health, Inc. (“Castlight”, “the Company” or “we”) provides health navigation solutions for large U.S. employers and health plans (“customers”) and their respective employees and members (“users”). Castlight’s offerings deliver a personalized and simplified user experience that helps connect individuals with the right provider or available benefit at the right time. Castlight’s navigation offerings have demonstrated measurable results, driving increased levels of user satisfaction and program utilization and lower healthcare costs for its customers and millions of users. 
The foundation of Castlight’s solutions is our proprietary single stack software-as-a-service platform. We believe our platform is unique in its: 
•Breadth and depth of data and partner integrations across the healthcare ecosystem; 
•Personalization engine that leverages data from these integrations to customize each user experience and help steer users to the right benefits and providers;
•Comprehensive coverage across a user’s available wellbeing, healthcare and condition management benefits; and
•Ability to engage a user through digital (web, mobile app) and high-touch (telephonic) communication modes.
Our platform’s services-oriented architecture enables us to extend our technology for use beyond our own applications. This enables us to serve health plans and other entities seeking to leverage our technology within their own member-facing applications or user touch points. 
We sell our platform as a suite of branded and white-labeled digital health navigation mobile applications and web services primarily to large, self-insured U.S. employers. We also sell branded product offerings through our direct sales force and partnerships with large benefits consultants, with a focus on serving large U.S. employers. 
In July 2019, we expanded our strategy to focus on health plans as a customer and to package our products to support user experiences beyond those of Castlight-powered websites and applications. Specifically, we seek to leverage our white-labeled health navigation offering and our platform’s services-oriented architecture to power health navigation delivered through third-party digital interfaces, such as a health plan’s existing member app. 
Since this strategic expansion, we have begun demonstrating proof points for our expanded strategy, including:
•In October 2019, we announced an enterprise license agreement with Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”) that provides Anthem with access to key components of our platform. We are seeking opportunities to replicate this model with other health plans, such as U.S. regional health plans.
•In late 2019, we introduced a pilot of our high-touch navigation offering – Castlight Care Guides – as a supplemental service for our large employer customers. Care Guides will support Castlight users and help them with their health navigation using Castlight’s core technology. We believe Castlight Care Guides will generate incremental user engagement and healthcare cost savings for our customers and users over time.
Castlight was incorporated in the State of Delaware in January 2008. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California.
The U.S. Healthcare Industry and Our Opportunity
We believe we have a significant opportunity to help existing and prospective customers and users navigate the major economic and social challenges associated with the U.S. healthcare system. We see the following industry trends affecting employers, health plans and individual users as potential long-term growth drivers for our business.
Our historical focus has been on large employers of the U.S. healthcare market. We continue to see significant opportunities within this customer category.

Employers play a significant role in U.S. healthcare benefits spending. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”):

•Employer-sponsored private health insurance totaled $1.1 trillion in 2018, up 4.1% year-over-year. More than half of this amount was from private employer contributions to health insurance premiums. 
•CMS forecasted these expenditures to grow at an average annual growth rate of 4.9% from 2017 to 2027. 

Nevertheless, employees continue to struggle to understand and utilize their benefits, limiting the effectiveness of employer cost and quality initiatives. Studies continue to demonstrate significant underutilization of such benefits:

•According to a November 2018 study conducted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, only 28% of employed adults are very confident they are fully utilizing their benefits, and only 38% are very confident they are current on the changes that have been made to their benefits.
•A March 2017 study by Fidelity Investments, Inc. and the National Business Group on Health (“NBGH”) reported utilization rates are below 20% for key benefits offerings like financial wellness, weight management, condition management and resilience.
•A January 2018 survey from NBGH and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association has shown that one in three employer respondents report difficulty generating employee engagement with their “point solution” benefits such as virtual care and chronic condition management. 
Based on these trends, we believe large employers are increasingly interested in innovative benefit plan designs and navigation technologies and services such as ours, to increase employee engagement, lower costs and improve outcomes:
•Large employers offer high-deductible health plans (“HDHPs”), which shift more financial decision making onto employees. In HDHPs, individuals have lower monthly insurance premiums than traditional plans, but pay more out of pocket for medical expenses until their deductible is met. A recent study from the National Center for Health Statistics shows that HDHP enrollment of adults with employer-based coverage increased from 15% to 43% between 2007 and 2017. 
•NBGH published a survey in September 2019 that listed their large employer members’ top healthcare initiatives for 2020: 
◦Implementing more digital care solutions;
◦Deploying a more focused strategy on high-cost claims;
◦Expanding “centers of excellence” -- programs with concentrated expertise in a particular medical area -- to include more conditions to lower costs; and
◦Implementing an engagement platform that aggregates point solutions and pushes personalized communications to employees.

As a result of these factors, we believe there is a significant opportunity to help large U.S. employers and their employees address their respective health benefit challenges through personalized health navigation solutions. Given the scalability of our platform, we also believe there is a significant market opportunity for us to offer our platform in new market categories by targeting health plans and other entities involved in health care services. Overall U.S. healthcare spending is projected to continue to grow each year for the foreseeable future:

•CMS estimates that U.S. national health expenditures totaled $3.6 trillion in 2018, an increase of 4.4% year-over-year. CMS expects national health expenditures to increase at an average annual growth rate of 5.5% from 2017 to 2027, totaling approximately $6.0 trillion in 2027. 
•As a percentage of gross domestic product, CMS estimates that U.S. national health expenditures were approximately 17.8% in 2018 and projected to increase to 19.4% in 2027. This is significantly higher than most other developed nations. 

However, there is scant evidence that these massive U.S. healthcare outlays are efficient or result in better outcomes for Americans:
•Research published in the October 2019 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that waste comprises approximately 25% of U.S. healthcare spending across categories, including failure of care delivery and coordination, over-treatment or low-value care, pricing failure, fraud and abuse and administrative complexity.
•A 2019 Peter G. Peterson Foundation study illustrates that, in spite of its lead in healthcare spending, the U.S. does not generate healthcare outcomes that exceed those of other developed countries. In fact, the U.S. underperforms in basic health outcome metrics such as life expectancy, infant mortality and unmanaged diabetes.
In addition to the massive spending and inadequate value discussed above, potential regulatory changes, demographic shifts and the emergence of value-based payments also impact health plans:

•In November 2019, CMS issued one final rule and one proposed rule to increase price transparency among hospitals, group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets. 
•Medicare Advantage (“MA”) enrollment continues to grow across both the Individual and Group MA markets. According to research conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 22 million enrollees in 2019 were on an individual MA plan in 2019 -- or 34% of the 64 million Medicare beneficiaries -- up from 23% of total Medicare enrollees in 2009. 
•The Group Medicare Advantage developed for employer and union group retirees now represents nearly 4.5 million enrollees in 2019, according to Mark Farrah Associates.

•Value-based programs reward health care providers with incentive payments for the quality of care they give to people with Medicare. CMS is rolling out “value-based care” programs within Medicare to shift provider payments away from the quantity of care provided and toward quality care for patients. As a result, payments associated with these programs are increasing relative to the traditional fee-for-service payment model currently dominant in healthcare. According to a 2018 study led by the Healthcare Payment Learning & Action Network, 34% of total U.S. healthcare payments in 2017 were value-based, up from 23% in 2015.
Health insurance is one of the lowest rated industries in terms of consumer satisfaction. Based on consumer demand, health insurers and providers are turning to digital tools to help improve their customer experience and lower costs:

•As benchmarked by the American Consumer Satisfaction Index issued in November 2018, the health insurance industry ranks 40th out of 46 industries in customer satisfaction. 
•A 2018 joint study conducted by Bain & Company and Google concluded that a prototypical health insurer can lower costs by 15% to 20% over the next five years by deploying digital technologies.
Based on these healthcare industry dynamics, we believe there is a significant opportunity for us to leverage our platform to help health plans and other entities responsible for managing healthcare costs. 
For example, we could power pricing, provider directory and personalization services that are delivered through a health plan’s existing member app that help users understand and utilize their health plan provider network and other benefits. We believe the platform could also be used to provide similar functionality to entities participating in value-based care programs to help these entities identify and partner with lower cost, higher-quality providers.

Our Solution
We have developed a comprehensive health navigation platform powered by a set of associated services and technologies that match individuals to the best resources available to them, and motivate them to take action. This, in turn, helps customers manage their benefits more effectively, and generate more value from their benefits investments. Our health navigation platform powers all of our products and services with the following key components:
Breadth and Depth of Data Integrations Across Major Health Plans, Benefits Vendors and Digital Health Point Solution Providers. Our ability to drive user engagement, program utilization and medical cost savings is based on our platform’s ability to ingest data across the entire healthcare ecosystem – from insurance carriers and employer eligibility files to third-party digital health point solutions and activity trackers – and utilize it to personalize the user experience. Further, the platform is designed to deliver these services in compliance with healthcare privacy and other applicable regulations.
The foundation of our platform is this breadth and depth of our data integrations, which, in aggregate, include more than one billion records. These integrations include:
•Claims data across: more than 30 medical payers and more than 30 providers spanning pharmacy benefit managers, dental payers, and behavioral/employee assistance programs;
•100+ employer eligibility file vendors;
•100+ bank integrations for health savings accounts (“HSA”); and
•100+ program integrations.
Our platform accesses data from additional sources, such as user searches, user-stated health goals, third-party provider quality sources, biometric data, Health Risk Assessment data, activity trackers, and third-party digital health programs, all of which are integrated into our platform.
Provider Quality Score. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched our proprietary provider quality score (“Q-Score”) to enhance our ability to recommend providers based on quality, in addition to cost and user convenience. Q-Score combines baseline provider metrics (years of experience, medical school degrees and board certifications) and third-party hospital and provider quality metrics with internally-derived outcomes metrics based on our analysis of our wealth of historical claims data. Based on these data inputs and our own proprietary algorithms, our platform is able to generate a Q-Score for approximately 80% of U.S. practitioners.
Castlight Genius Personalization Engine. Genius leverages our vast data resources to guide employees to the right available care, benefit program, or content based on their individual health needs. Genius works as follows:
•Genius uses our data sets to score our user population across clinical and wellbeing categories;
•Genius then stratifies these categories into 100+ different targeting segments; and 
•Based on this segmentation and demographic data, Genius sends personalized educational content and recommendations to users. User outreach is delivered through channels such as email, mobile push notifications, and in-app and website.
Genius employs rules-based methods and machine learning models to segment the Castlight user population. During 2019, we doubled Genius’s segment-level targeting capacity to further enhance its personalization capabilities.
Third-Party Digital Health Ecosystem Program Integrations. We leverage our open architecture to simplify benefit vendor integration and management. Our platform integrates with nearly any vendor to create one seamless experience with third-party digital health applications and services across categories such as: activity tracking, biometric screening, financial wellness, health risk assessment, mental health and fitness, nutrition management, physical and behavioral health, resilience, second opinion, sleep management, weight coaching, and management of various specific conditions (e.g. heart health, diabetes, holistic wellbeing, maternal health, and medical decision support). 
Comprehensive Employee Experience. We have designed our solutions to be the first place users go whenever they have a health benefits related need, wherever they are in their health journey. Whether a user is staying healthy or managing a condition, our solution engages them with personalized content and communication through branded and white-labeled websites and mobile applications.
Services-Oriented Architecture. We designed our platform with a services-oriented architecture, enabling us to extend its use beyond our own applications. This enables us to serve health plans and other entities wishing to leverage our technology within their own member-facing applications or user touch points. Our platform also includes services components such as pricing, personalization and provider directories.
Measurable Value. Since launching Castlight Complete in September 2018, we have demonstrated Complete’s ability to drive measurable value across three core areas: (i) user engagement; (ii) user behavior change; and (iii) medical cost savings that translate into a return on investment (“ROI”) on the customer’s Complete subscription costs. For example:
•User Engagement: 
◦Registration and Return Rates: Complete drove a 60%-plus subscriber registration rate and a 38% monthly user return rate over the course of 2019.
◦Employee Experience: The Castlight Complete mobile app generated a Net Promoter Score of 75 in 2019. In addition, Complete's Apple App Store rating was 4.7 stars with more than 10,000 reviews in 2019.
•Behavior Change:
◦Appropriate care: 38% of registered Castlight users had a preventive office visit over the year compared with only 25% of non-users. 
◦High-value provider: Employees using Complete received care in an emergency room 25% less often than non-users after being directed to more appropriate care options. Additionally, Complete has reduced medical spending, including approximately 12% reduction in labs and imaging costs for those who search for care within the Castlight app. 
◦Program utilization: Complete achieved 1.4 to 2.4 times higher engagement in employer-offered health and wellness solutions that are integrated into the Complete platform.
•Medical Cost Saving/ROI: In the latest reporting period available, 2018, Complete customers typically achieved 1.4% medical cost savings. For an employer with 20,000 employees, this equates to over $2 million in medical cost savings.
Our Products
For Large Employers: We offer our platform through three packages which we sell through our direct sales force:
Care Guidance Navigator: Our Care Guidance Navigator (“Care Guidance”) empowers users to make better care decisions and navigate their employer-sponsored healthcare benefit programs through an experience tailored specifically for a user’s networks, health plans, care options, and programs. By helping individuals choose the right available benefit and right care option at the right time, Care Guidance Navigator seeks to improve user satisfaction with benefits while helping employers achieve medical costs savings.
Wellbeing Navigator: Our personalized, incentivized Wellbeing Navigator (“Wellbeing”) helps drive engagement across an employer’s entire benefits program. Wellbeing Navigator leverages a robust data set, advanced personalization and incentives to help drive engagement, improve health and increase employee satisfaction.
Complete Health Navigator: Complete Health Navigator (“Complete” or “Castlight Complete”) combines the full functionality of the Wellbeing Navigator and Care Guidance Navigator packages in one unified user experience. Complete addresses the unique needs of an organization and guides users through their entire health journey. Complete delivers personalized content and communications, whether users are working to stay healthy or managing a condition. 
All the above Navigator packages include ecosystem integrations, the Castlight Genius personalization engine, and an engagement hub that aggregates all employee benefits, personalized recommendations and communications into one central location.
Castlight Care Guides: In October 2019, we announced the creation of a high-touch navigation service to complement our Navigator offerings. Castlight Care Guides combines Castlight’s personalized health navigation technology with a high-touch service to help navigate users to the best care for them. Examples include Care Guide support to assist users searching for care, understanding their benefits, challenging healthcare bills, or navigating a clinical need. With the addition of Castlight Care Guides, an employer can deploy both digital and high-touch navigation solutions and will no longer be limited to choose between the two options. We plan to make this solution broadly available in the third quarter of 2020.
For Health Plans:
White-Labeled Health Navigation Solutions: We offer white-labeled digital health navigation solutions to health plans. Currently, we power the Engage offering that Anthem deploys to its Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans in the United States. Engage delivers the personalized user experience of our platform to Anthem members with additional features available through deep integrations with Anthem’s own assets, such as the Anthem Health Guide concierge, Anthem’s clinical and care management programs, and Anthem’s gaps-in-care and clinical analytics. Engage is offered in multiple packages, including a more streamlined version that can be offered by Anthem to its smaller size clients. Engage is available to Anthem, Inc. national accounts and large group accounts.
Embedded Platform Technology Services: As part of the Anthem enterprise license agreement effective January 1, 2020, we provide Anthem with a non-exclusive license for some of our underlying health navigation platform technology services, such as transparency and personalization. We offer our platform’s underlying technology services to other health plans seeking to embed our platform functionality into their existing user experiences instead of offering a full white-labeled solution.
Our Services
We provide a range of services to help employers implement and maximize the value of our offering, including:
Implementation Services. We provide implementation services to our customers to help ensure successful deployment of our offering, including executing required data feeds, loading customer data, configuring products, integrating with third-party and other applications, communication and comprehensive testing. We also offer communications services to drive employee engagement with our offering that span educational presentations, email campaigns, print collateral and employer-specific media. Communications initiatives are typically run during open enrollment, time of product launch and periodically post launch, and are designed to drive employee engagement and change management. Fees for these services are included as part of our contracts.

User and Customer Support. We offer end user support to help ensure effective use of our platform. We provide telephonic, live chat and email support for employees and their families in the areas of account maintenance, technical issue resolution, and navigation of online services. We offer interactive sessions to our customers that help them understand the impact of our product through various standard and customized reporting and provide deeper insights about their employee populations with a focus on employee engagement. Fees for these services are included as part of our subscription contracts.
Marketplace: Store and Rewards Center. To help employers drive employee engagement with their benefits, we offer an online store where employers can offer third-party health products and services (e.g. fitness trackers) to their 
employees for use with Wellbeing Navigator’s activity tracking functionality. Additionally, we power a Rewards Center where employees can redeem incentive points for items such as contributions to their HSA accounts, gift cards, and donations to charity. Revenues from products sold through our online marketplace are recognized on a net basis principally because we are not the primary obligor to the end-customers.
Customers
Our customers consist primarily of large self-insured employers and health plans, representing a wide range of industries, such as education, manufacturing, retail, technology and government, and includes some of the largest employers in the United States. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or health plan, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, which has entered into a master subscription agreement with us to access our platform, including customers that are in the process of deploying our platform to their users.
In October 2019, we entered into a 30-month enterprise license agreement with Anthem, effective January 1, 2020, that extends and expands our existing relationship with Anthem first announced in 2015. The agreement includes our core care guidance technology, the Engage health navigation platform, and a new, non-exclusive license for some of our underlying health navigation platform technology services, such as transparency and personalization. With this new agreement, Anthem has moved from a channel partner for the Engage offering to a health plan customer.
Employees and Culture
We view our employees and company culture as critical assets for our business and a source of competitive strength. Our leadership team is focused on supporting our employees and fostering our unique culture. We believe this has enabled us to attract and retain some of the best minds in technology and health care to build and advance our platform.
As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of 463 full-time employees. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Sales and Marketing
We have a hybrid sales model that leverages a national direct sales organization and partner relationships. 
Our sales team comprises enterprise-focused field sales professionals who are organized into geography-based teams. Our field professionals target large, self-insured U.S. employers and health plans. The sales team is supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data experts.
We also have a team of professionals who maintain relationships with key industry participants including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations, and health plan partners. These partners can support our sales efforts to varying degrees by sourcing prospects, and working in collaboration with our direct sales team during the sales process. Through these relationships, we believe we are able to reach a broader set of potential customers and leverage existing relationships to promote our health benefits platform and products.
We also generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. These programs target human resource executives and benefits leaders in addition to senior business leaders and health care and benefits channel partners, and include value-add research and learning opportunities for potential customers, channel marketing, demand generation activities, field marketing events, direct e-mail campaigns and participation in user conferences, industry events, trade shows and customer conferences.
Technology and Operations
We have designed our technology infrastructure to provide a highly available and secure multi-tenant, cloud-based offering. Our multi-tenant platforms allow us to use a standard data model and consistent management practices for all customers with multiple possible configurations, while securely partitioning each customer’s application data. This approach 
provides significant operating leverage and improved efficiency as it helps us reduce our fixed cost base and minimize unused capacity on our hardware. 
The architecture, deployment and management of our technology are focused on: 
•Scalability. We have developed a robust and scalable data architecture infrastructure, which allows for automated loading and normalization of numerous data sources, including billions of claim transactions in our data warehouse. 
•Standardization. Our technology assimilates structured and unstructured data from disparate sources, and employs unique algorithms to convert these data into user-friendly information for our users. Additionally, we operate using Service-Oriented Architecture principles, with a platform of services that serve to deliver the application in a scalable and standardized way. 
•Security. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches and prevent unauthorized access to our data or the data of our customers. We strictly regulate and limit all access to on-demand servers and networks at our production and remote backup facilities. All users are validated, authenticated and authorized before they can access our system. Users must have a valid user ID and associated password to log on to our services. We require Transport Layer Security between the user’s browser and our servers to protect data in transit. Encrypted backup files are transmitted over secure connections to redundant storage in a secondary data center. 
We currently host our products from regionally dispersed data centers and lease third-party industry-class data center hosting facilities throughout the United States. We rely on third-party vendors to provide infrastructure support for our data centers, which are designed to host computer systems that require high levels of availability and have redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. We utilize commercially available hardware for our data center servers. Our data center facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems and advanced fire and flood prevention.
Compliance and Certifications
Our software services and data are located at independently managed and third-party data center hosting facilities. We require those vendors to obtain third-party security examinations relating to security and data privacy such as Service Organization Controls (“SOC”) SOC 1 or SOC 2 reports. Our vendors’ examinations are conducted at least every 12 months by an independent third-party auditor, and address, among other areas, physical and environmental safeguards for production data centers, data availability and integrity procedures, change management procedures and logical security procedures. An independent auditor conducts an annual SOC 2 Type II audit of our operating processes and procedures and HITRUST certifications of our security controls. Our annual internal audits are based upon the international standard ISO/IEC 27001 that addresses, among other things, security, data privacy and operational controls.
Strategic Relationships
Data Collaborations. We have relationships with many national and regional health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, dental insurers, behavioral health plans, and health savings plans to support our mutual customers. These collaborations provide us with claims, balance integrations and other data on behalf of our employer customers. We have developed technologies in collaboration with several payers including real-time integrated APIs. The increasing number of data integrations we have in place is helping to position us as a health navigation platform for our customers, and enables employers to consolidate many of their sources of benefits information into a single point of reference.
Benefit Consultants and Brokers. Our relationships with brokers and consultants complement our direct sales capabilities. Through these relationships, we gain the ability to reach a broader set of potential customers and leverage existing relationships to promote our health benefits platform and cross-pollinate customer opportunities.
Ecosystem Vendors. Castlight’s ecosystem provides access to pre-integrated digital health partners that we can resell to provide a more streamlined experience for our users. In addition to our sales partnerships, we also have performed over 1,000 third-party integrations for our customers that deliver effortless access to external benefit programs for our users.
Competition
Our market is still in an early stage of development, but is rapidly evolving and competitive. We currently face competition from both existing and emerging vendors across a variety of categories, from specialists in the care guidance and wellbeing areas of the market, to broader offerings that compete with our full health navigation platform. A listing of some of our common competitors, grouped by major category, includes:
•Care Guidance competitors, which include: independent vendors such as ClearCost Health, Sapphire Digital (formerly Vitals), Compass, Healthcare Bluebook, Accolade, HealthAdvocate, HealthSparq, and Quantum Health; and U.S. health plans such as Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, United Healthcare Group, Inc., and Health Care Services Corporation that bundle basic care guidance functionality into their offering;
•Wellbeing competitors, which include: Limeade, VirginPulse and Vitality; and
•Platform competitors, which include: United Healthcare Group’s Rally Health offering, and emerging competitors such as Evive, Welltok, and Sharecare.
The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
•ability to curate complex data from multiple sources and present it through an easy to navigate user interface;
•capability for customization through configuration, integration, security, scalability and reliability of products;
•ease of use and rates of user engagement;
•complementary technology platform and high touch services;
•breadth and depth of application functionality;
•competitive and understandable pricing; 
•size of customer base and level of user engagement;
•depth of access to third-party data sources; 
•ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
•ability to innovate and respond rapidly to customer needs and regulatory changes;
•domain expertise in benefits and health care consumerism;
•accessibility on any browser or mobile device;
•clearly defined implementation timeline; and
•customer branding and styling.
While we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors, many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution or other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the health care industry. We also may face competition from new entrants to the field as healthcare delivery and services continue to evolve. As a result, we may not always compare favorably with respect to certain of the above factors. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. In addition, we may not be able to prevent others from developing technology that is similar to, but not the same as our proprietary technology. We generally require employees, consultants, customers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2019, we had one issued patent and two patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patent expires on July 27, 2031. We own and use trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States and elsewhere. We have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our products are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our offering. In addition, policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and may not be effective.
We expect that we and others in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. Any such claim could pose a substantial distraction to the management of the company. A successful claim of this type may be costly and could require us to spend substantial time and effort in making our offering non-infringing.
Strategic Acquisition
On April 3, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Jiff, Inc (“Jiff”). Jiff provided an enterprise health benefits platform that served as a central hub for employee wellbeing and employee benefit programs and is the foundation for our Wellbeing Navigator. The acquisition enabled us to develop a product offering that provides the full spectrum of wellbeing, healthcare decision support and an engagement hub all in one complete package. 
Regulatory Environment
Participants in the health care industry are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations in the United States at the federal and state levels as well as applicable international laws. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of laws, and we may be affected by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, both at the federal and state level, which could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. We have attempted to structure our operations to comply with applicable legal requirements, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives.
Healthcare Reform
Our business could be affected by changes in health care laws, including without limitation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which was enacted in March 2010. The ACA has changed how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of individuals, changes in Medicare program spending and insurance market reforms. Ongoing government and legislative initiatives may bring about other changes.
While most of the provisions of the ACA and other health care reform legislation will not be directly applicable to us, they may affect the business of many of our customers, which may in turn affect our business. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of the ACA, any amendment or repeal of the ACA,
or other health care reform on our business model, financial condition, or results of operations, negative changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure may negatively impact our business.
Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
U.S.-HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. There are many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal health information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), is a major new state law poised to affect the privacy landscape globally and allows the California Attorney General to impose fines for CCPA violations. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and the earliest the California Attorney General may bring an enforcement action under the CCPA is July 1, 2020. The CCPA is applicable to our business and, as such, we implemented changes to our business operations aimed at compliance with the CCPA. However, the CCPA will likely require further changes to our business once the California Attorney General finalizes the draft regulations.
Additionally, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, collectively HIPAA, establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our health plan customers, as well as health care clearinghouses and certain providers with which we may have or may establish business relationships, are covered entities that are regulated under HIPAA. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010, significantly expanded HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” who are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are considered a “business associate” to our customers and thus are directly subject to HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. In order to provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with it. Such agreements must, among other things, require us to:

•limit how we will use and disclose the protected health information;
•implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;
•enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information;
•report security incidents, breaches and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and
•assist the customer in question with certain duties under the privacy standards. 
                In addition to HIPAA regulations, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive practices and laws that place specific requirements on use of data. We cannot provide assurance regarding how the various privacy and security laws will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations.
International Privacy Requirements. International Privacy Requirements. In Europe, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which replaced the 1995 European Union (“EU”) Directive on Data Protection in May 2018. GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of European Union residents, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
Data Protection and Breaches. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA, we must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to our contractual partners. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Under the GDPR, the data controller is required to report personal data breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovery of the breach.
We have implemented and maintained physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data, and have processes in place to assist our compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements regarding the protection of these data and properly responding to any security breaches or incidents. However, we 
cannot be sure that these safeguards are adequate to protect all personal data, or to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal data, and responding to any security breaches or incidents. Furthermore, in many cases, applicable state laws, including breach notification requirements, are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thereby complicating our compliance efforts. Additionally, state and federal laws regarding deceptive practices may apply to public assurances we give to individuals about the security of services we provide on behalf of our contractual customers.
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personally identifiable information, individually identifiable health information and health care provider information. Some states also are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of such information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our customers’ and users' information, including confidential and protected health information (“PHI”). Our security strategy employs various practices and technology to control and protect access to sensitive information. In February 2019, our application and infrastructure received certification status from the Health Information Trust Alliance, or HITRUST, the healthcare industry group that certifies an entity’s material compliance with HIPAA, and various states’ security and privacy laws regarding the creation, access, storage or exchange of personal health and financial information. Our certification status signifies that we exhibit and are able to maintain high security standards of electronic PHI.
