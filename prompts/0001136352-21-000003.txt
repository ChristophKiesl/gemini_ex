Introduction
Crestwood Equity, a Delaware limited partnership formed in March 2001, is a master limited partnership (MLP) that develops, acquires, owns or controls, and operates primarily fee-based assets and operations within the energy midstream sector. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we provide broad-ranging infrastructure solutions across the value chain to service premier liquids-rich natural gas and crude oil shale plays across the United States. We own and operate a diversified portfolio of NGL, crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering, processing, storage, disposal and transportation assets that connect fundamental energy supply with energy demand across North America. Our primary business objective is to maximize the value of Crestwood for our unitholders. Crestwood Equity’s common units representing limited partner interests are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CEQP” and its preferred units representing limited partner interests are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “CEQP-P.”
Crestwood Equity is a holding company. All of our consolidated operating assets are owned by or through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestwood Midstream, a Delaware limited partnership. In addition, we have equity investments in joint ventures through which we operate certain of their respective assets.
Ownership Structure
We conduct our operations and own our operating assets through subsidiaries and joint ventures. The diagram below reflects a simplified version of our ownership structure as of December 31, 2020: 
Our Assets 
Our financial statements reflect three operating and reporting segments, including (i) gathering and processing (G&P); (ii) storage and transportation (S&T); and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics (MS&L), which are described below.

We generate G&P revenues predominantly under fee-based contracts, which minimizes our commodity price exposure and provides less volatile operating performance and cash flows. Our principal G&P systems are described below. 
Bakken
We own and operate an integrated crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering system and gas processing facility (the Arrow system) in the core of the Bakken Shale in McKenzie and Dunn Counties, North Dakota, some of which is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.  Located approximately 60 miles southeast of the COLT Hub, the Arrow system connects to our COLT Hub through the Kinder Morgan Inc.’s (Kinder Morgan) Double H Pipeline system and Tesoro High Plains Pipeline Company LLC’s, a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (Marathon), crude oil pipeline systems, as well as to Patoka, Illinois and Gulf Coast markets through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) interstate pipeline system.  In addition, the Arrow system has 266,000 Bbls of crude oil working storage capacity and multiple pipeline take-away outlets, salt water disposal wells and a natural gas processing facility (Bear Den). The Bear Den facility and associated pipelines at the Arrow system fulfill 100% of the processing requirements for producers on the Arrow system. Our operations are anchored by long-term gathering contracts and our underlying contracts largely provide for fixed-fee gathering services with annual escalators for crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services. 
Powder River Basin
We own and operate the Jackalope gas gathering system in Converse County, Wyoming, which connects to 153 well pads and is supported by a long-term gathering and processing agreement with Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake) that has a remaining contract term of 16 years. Effective February 1, 2021, the gas gathering and processing agreement was amended to revise its rates and provide minimum revenue guarantees for three years.
Marcellus
We own and operate natural gas gathering and compression systems in Harrison and Doddridge Counties, West Virginia. These systems consist of 72 miles of low pressure gathering lines and nine compression and dehydration stations with 130,180 horsepower. Through these systems, we provide midstream services under long-term, fixed-fee contracts across two operating areas: our eastern area of operation (East AOD), where we are the exclusive gatherer, and our western area of operation (West AOD), where we provide compression services.
In the East AOD, we provide gathering, dehydration and compression services on a fixed-fee basis. We gather and ultimately redeliver our customers’ natural gas to MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P.’s Sherwood gas processing plant and various regional pipeline systems. In the West AOD, we provide compression and dehydration services on a fixed-fee basis predominantly utilizing our West Union and Victoria compressor stations, each with a maximum capacity of 120 MMcf/d. The agreement associated with our Victoria compressor station provides for a minimum volume commitment of approximately 50% of the throughput capacity through April 2021.
Barnett
We own and operate three systems in the Barnett Shale, including the Cowtown, Lake Arlington and the Alliance systems. Our Cowtown system, which is located principally in the southern portion of the Fort Worth, Texas Basin, consists of pipelines that gather rich gas produced by customers and deliver the volumes to our Cowtown processing plant, which includes two natural gas processing units that extract NGLs from the natural gas stream and deliver customers’ residue gas and extracted NGLs to unaffiliated pipelines for sale downstream. Our Lake Arlington system, which is located in eastern Tarrant County, Texas, consists of a dry gas gathering system and related dehydration and compression facilities. Our Alliance system, which is located in northern Tarrant and southern Denton Counties, Texas, consists of a dry gas gathering system and a related dehydration, compression and amine treating facility. 
Delaware Permian 
Our gathering and processing segment includes our 50% equity interest in Crestwood Permian, a joint venture between Crestwood Infrastructure Holdings LLC (Crestwood Infrastructure), our wholly-owned subsidiary, and an affiliate of First Reserve. Crestwood Permian owns (i) low-pressure dry gas and rich natural gas gathering systems with a primary focus on the Willow Lake system, which includes approximately 55 MMcf/d of processing capacity that serves customers in Eddy County, New Mexico; (ii) a 200 MMcf/d natural gas processing facility in Orla, Texas, (the Orla plant); (iii) the Orla Express Pipeline, a 33 mile, 20-inch high pressure line connecting the existing Willow Lake system with the Orla plant; and (iv) a produced water gathering and disposal system capable of handling 60,000 Bbls/d of produced water in Culberson and Reeves Counties, Texas.
Crestwood Permian also owns an undivided interest in 80,000 Bbls/d of capacity in a segment of the Epic Y-Grade Pipeline, LP (EPIC) pipeline from Orla, Texas to Benedum, Texas, where the pipeline interconnects with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP’s (Chevron Phillips) pipeline. This capacity is supported by a purchase and sale agreement with Chevron Phillips to sell a dedicated volume of barrels to be delivered off the EPIC pipeline to Chevron Phillips’ pipeline. Crestwood Permian’s ownership in the EPIC pipeline provides a competitive NGL takeaway solution to allow Crestwood Permian to grow its footprint in the Delaware Basin. Crestwood Permian is well positioned to securely and economically move Orla NGL products into Gulf Coast markets, which provides its customers optionality and flow assurance that creates a unique competitive advantage for us.
Crestwood Permian owns a 50% equity interest in Crestwood Permian Basin and Shell Midstream Partners L.P. (Shell Midstream), a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, owns the remaining 50% equity interest in Crestwood Permian Basin. Crestwood Permian Basin owns the Nautilus gathering system which includes 94 receipt point meters, 156 miles of pipeline, a 41-mile high pressure header system, 45,000 horsepower of compression and seven high pressure delivery points. The Nautilus gathering system will be expanded over time, as production increases, to include additional gathering lines and centralized compression facilities which will ultimately provide over 250 MMcf/d of gas gathering capacity. Crestwood Permian Basin has a long-term agreement with SWEPI LP (SWEPI), a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, to own and operate the Nautilus gathering system in SWEPI’s operated position in the Delaware Permian. In addition, Crestwood Permian Basin provides gathering, dehydration and treating services to SWEPI under a long-term fixed-fee gathering agreement. SWEPI has dedicated to Crestwood Permian Basin the gathering rights for SWEPI’s gas production across a large acreage position in Loving, Reeves and Ward Counties, Texas. 
The table below summarizes certain contract information of our G&P operations (including our equity investment and its operations) as of December 31, 2020:

Shale Play | Type of Contracts(1) | Weighted Average Remaining Contract Terms (in years) | Major Customers 
Bakken | Mixed | 9 | Devon Energy Corporation, Rimrock Oil & Gas, LP, XTO Energy Inc., Bruin E&P Partners, LLC
Powder River Basin | Fixed-fee | 16 | Chesapeake 
Marcellus | Fixed-fee | 11 | Antero Resources Corporation 
Barnett | Mixed | 5 | Blackbeard Operating, LLC, Newark Acquisition I L.P. 
Delaware Permian | Fixed-fee | 13 | SWEPI, Mewbourne Oil Company (Mewbourne) 
 | Mixed | 3 | Mewbourne, Concho Resources 

(1)Fixed-fee contracts represent contracts in which our customers agree to pay a flat rate based on the amount of gas delivered. Mixed contracts include percent-of-proceeds and fixed-fee arrangements.
We provide gathering, processing, compression, disposal, storage and transportation services under a variety of contracts. Although the cash flows from our G&P operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with remaining terms ranging from 1-16 years, the results of our G&P operations are significantly influenced by the volumes gathered and processed through our systems. The cash flows from our G&P operations can also be impacted in the short term by changing commodity prices, seasonality, weather fluctuations and the financial condition of our customers. Our election to enter primarily into fixed-fee contracts subject to acreage dedication helps minimize our G&P segment’s long-term exposure to commodity prices and its impact on the financial condition of our customers, and provides us more stable operating performance and cash flows. 
Storage and Transportation Segment

(1)Firm contracts represent take-or-pay contracts whereby our customers agree to pay for a specified amount of storage or transportation capacity, whether or not the capacity is utilized.
(2)Consists of 22 MBbls/d of rail loading and transportation volumes and 285 MBbls/d of storage volumes.
The cash flows from our S&T operations are predominantly fee-based under contracts with remaining terms ranging from 1-5 years. Our current cash flows from crude-by-rail facilities are supported by take-or-pay contracts with refiners and marketers. The rates and durations of the contracts associated with our crude oil terminals have eroded as pipelines have come on-line that make crude-by-rail options less economical, which impacts our cash flows from operations. Cash flows from interruptible and other hub services provided by the natural gas storage facilities and pipelines owned by our joint ventures tends to increase during the peak winter season.
Marketing, Supply and Logistics Segment
Our MS&L segment consists of our NGL, crude oil and natural gas marketing and logistics operations. We utilize our trucking and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, terminals and contracted storage and pipeline capacity to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers. 
Our marketing, supply and logistics operating assets include:
•A fleet of rail and rolling stock with approximately 1.6 MMBbls/d of NGL pipeline, terminal and transportation capacity, which also includes our rail-to-truck terminals located in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi. We provide hauling services to customers primarily in the Central Mid-Continent and East Coast of the United States.
•Storage facilities with approximately 10 MMBbls of NGL storage capacity. Our storage facilities are located in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Mississippi, Michigan, New York and Indiana, with receipts and deliveries that are supported by both rail cars and third party pipelines, allowing truck and rail access to local markets.
The cash flows from our marketing, supply and logistics business represent sales to creditworthy customers typically under contracts with durations of one year or less, and tend to be seasonal in nature due to customer profiles and their tendencies to purchase NGLs during peak winter periods.
Major Customers 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2019, British Petroleum and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total consolidated revenues. 
Competition 
Our G&P operations compete for customers based on reputation, operating reliability and flexibility, price, creditworthiness, and service offerings, including interconnectivity to producer-desired takeaway options (i.e., processing facilities and pipelines). We face strong competition in acquiring new supplies in the production basins in which we operate, and competition customarily is impacted by the level of drilling activity in a particular geographic region and fluctuations in commodity prices. Our primary competitors include other midstream companies with G&P operations and producer-owned systems, and certain competitors enjoy first-mover advantages over us and may offer producers greater gathering and processing efficiencies, lower operating costs and more flexible commercial terms. 
Natural gas storage and pipeline operators compete for customers primarily based on geographic location, which determines connectivity and proximity to supply sources and end-users, as well as price, operating reliability and flexibility, available capacity and service offerings. Our primary competitors in our natural gas storage market include other independent storage providers and major natural gas pipelines with storage capabilities embedded within their transmission systems. Our primary competitors in the natural gas transportation market include major natural gas pipelines and intrastate pipelines that can transport natural gas volumes between interstate systems. Long-haul pipelines often enjoy cost advantages over new pipeline projects with respect to options for delivering greater volumes to existing demand centers, and new projects and expansions proposed from time to time may serve the markets we serve and effectively displace the service we provide to customers. 
Our crude oil rail terminals primarily compete with crude oil pipelines and other midstream companies that own and operate rail terminals in the markets we serve. The crude oil logistics business is characterized by strong competition for supplies, and competition is based largely on customer service quality, pricing, and geographic proximity to customers and other market hubs. 
Our NGL marketing and logistics business competes primarily with integrated major oil companies, refiners and processors, and other energy companies that own or control transportation and storage assets that can be optimized for supply, marketing and logistics services. 
Regulation
Our operations and investments are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities. The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, impacts our profitability. In general, midstream companies have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years.
Pipeline and Underground Storage Safety 
We are subject to pipeline safety regulations imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline and storage facilities. All of our natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (NGPSA), and all of our NGL and crude oil pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (HLPSA). 
These federal statutes and PHMSA regulations collectively impose numerous safety requirements on pipeline operators, such as the development of a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities and the implementation of pipeline integrity management programs. For example, pursuant to the authority under the NGPSA and HLPSA, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas, known as high consequence areas (HCAs), high-population areas (also known as moderate consequence areas (MCAs), as well as Class 3 and Class 4 areas, which are determined by specific population densities near our pipeline), certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas, along our 
pipelines, and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. Integrity management programs require more frequent inspections and other preventative measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs and MCAs. 
We plan to continue testing under our pipeline integrity management programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines in accordance with PHMSA regulations. Notwithstanding our preventive and investigatory maintenance efforts, we may incur significant expenses if anomalous pipeline conditions are discovered or due to the implementation of more stringent pipeline safety standards resulting from new or amended legislation. 
Legislation in the past decade has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (2011 Pipeline Safety Act) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (2016 Pipeline Safety Act). Among other things, the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act extended PHMSA’s statutory mandate through September 2019 and, among other things, required PHMSA to complete certain of its outstanding mandates under the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act and develop new safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. More recently, in December 2020, Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2021 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, made effective on December 27, 2020, pursuant to which Congress adopted the “Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020.” The PIPES Act of 2020 reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several proposed regulatory actions that among, other things, will require operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations.
Several rulemakings were adopted or made effective during 2020, which further impose added pipeline safety requirements on operators.
•Natural Gas Storage Facilities. In February 2020, PHMSA published a final rule that amended the minimum safety issues applicable to natural gas storage facilities, including wells, wellbore tubing and casing. The final rule replaces an interim rule first adopted by PHMSA in December 2016 that was subject to a series of delays in full implementation between 2016 and 2019 as PHMSA reconsidered aspects of the rulemaking. The February 2020 rule was further amended in July 2020 to include certain applicable reporting requirements that had been deleted when the February 2020 rule was published. 
•Gas Mega Rulemakings. In October 2019, PHMSA published the first of three expected final rules relating to new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas pipelines that had originally been proposed by the agency in 2016 as a single rulemaking, known as the “Gas Mega Rule.” The October 2019 final rule, made effective in July 2020, imposes numerous requirements, including maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) reconfirmation through re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which re-certification process may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested, the periodic assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs (that is, in MCAs as well as Class 3 and Class 4 areas), the reporting of exceedances of MAOP and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. Additional amendments to this October 2019 final rule relating to recordkeeping for gas transmission lines were published by PHMSA in July 2020. The remaining rulemakings comprising the former Gas Mega Rule proposal have not yet been published, and we cannot predict when they will be finalized; however, they are expected to include revised pipeline repair criteria as well as more stringent corrosion control requirements. 
•Hazardous Liquids Rulemaking. In October 2019, PHMSA published a final rule, made effective in July 2020, that significantly extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines, including, for example, performance of periodic assessments and expanded use of leak detection systems, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to an HCA. Additionally, this final rule requires all hazardous liquid pipelines in or affecting an HCA to be capable of accommodating in line inspection tools within a 20-year period. Moreover, this final rule extends annual, accident, and safety-related conditional reporting requirements to hazardous liquid gravity lines and certain gathering lines and imposes inspection requirements on hazardous liquid pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure.
We are evaluating the operational and financial impact related to one or more of these laws and PHMSA rules. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, and the PIPES Act of 2020, as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance 
by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate pipelines, but most states are certified by the Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate pipelines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. Our pipelines have operations and maintenance plans designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety requirements, and we do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. 
Natural Gas Gathering 
Natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from FERC jurisdiction under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline, and not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation. The FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided are not exempt from FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, the services provided by such facility would be subject to FERC regulation. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the FERC.
States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, requirements prohibiting undue discrimination, and complaint-based rate regulation. Our natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which we operate. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer, or one source of supply over another source of supply, and generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas.
The states in which we operate gathering systems have adopted a form of complaint-based regulation, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. To date, these regulations have not had an adverse effect on our systems. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future, however, a failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.
In Texas, we have filed with the Texas Railroad Commission (TRRC) to establish rates and terms of service for certain of our pipelines. Our assets in Texas include intrastate common carrier NGL pipelines subject to the regulation of the TRRC, which requires that our NGL pipelines file tariff publications containing all the rules and the regulations governing the rates and charges for services we perform. NGL pipeline rates may be limited to provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services.
NGL Storage 
Our NGL storage terminals are subject primarily to state and local regulation. For example, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (INDNR), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) and the EPA have jurisdiction over the underground storage of NGLs and NGL related well drilling, well conversions and well plugging in Indiana, New York and Michigan, respectively. The INDNR regulates aspects of our Seymour facility, the NYSDEC and EPA regulate aspects of the Bath facility and the EGLE and EPA regulate aspects of our Alto facility. Additionally, NGL terminals have the potential to be subject to state and federal air compliance regulations. For example, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the EPA have 
jurisdiction over facilities with the potential to emit regulated air pollutants in Pennsylvania. The PADEP regulates those aspects of the Schaefferstown facility. 
Crude Oil Transportation
The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an interstate basis is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. The ICA and FERC regulations also require that such rates be just and reasonable, and to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner so as to not confer undue preference upon any shipper. The transportation of crude oil by common carrier pipelines on an intrastate basis is subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate crude oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate crude oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Intrastate common carriers must also offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. Our crude oil pipelines in North Dakota are not common carrier pipelines and, therefore, are not subject to rate regulation by the FERC or any state regulatory commission. We cannot, however, provide assurance that the FERC will not, at some point, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of our crude oil pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or are otherwise not exempt from the FERC’s filing or reporting requirements, or that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations. In the event the FERC were to determine that our crude oil pipelines are subject to FERC requirements for common carrier pipelines, or otherwise would not qualify for a waiver from the FERC’s applicable regulatory requirements, we would likely be required to (i) file a tariff with the FERC; (ii) provide a cost justification for the transportation charge; (iii) provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination; and (iv) potentially be subject to fines, penalties or other sanctions. Our equity investments’ crude oil pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation under HLPSA.
Certain of our crude oil operations located in North Dakota are subject to state regulation by the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). For example, gas conditioning requirements established by the NDIC recently will require operators of crude by rail terminals to report to the NDIC any crude volumes received for loading that exceed federal vapor pressure limits. State legislation has been proposed that, if passed, would authorize and require the NDIC to promulgate regulations under which produced water pipelines would be required to, among other things, install leak detection facilities and post bonds to cover potential remediation costs associated with releases. Moreover, the regulation of our customers’ production activities by the NDIC impacts our operations. For example, the NDIC approved additional requirements relating to site construction, underground gathering pipelines, spill containment, bonding for underground gathering pipelines and construction of berms around facilities. Additionally, the NDIC issued an order wherein the agency adopted legally enforceable “gas capture percentage goals” requiring our customers to capture certain percentages of natural gas produced by specified dates (Gas Capture Order). The Gas Capture Order was subsequently modified in 2018. Exploration and production operators in the state may be required to install new equipment to satisfy these goals, and any failure by operators to meet these gas capture percentage goals would subject those operators to production restrictions, which could reduce the amount of commodities we gather on the Arrow system from our customers, and have a corresponding adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Portions of our Arrow gathering system, which is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, may be subject to applicable regulation by the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation. An entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations may apply to operators and other parties within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American lands. These regulations include lease provisions, environmental standards, tribal employment preferences and numerous other matters.
Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and BLM. However, Native American tribes possess certain inherent authorities to enact and enforce their own internal laws and regulations as long as such laws and regulations do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes. These tribal laws and regulations may include various fees, taxes and requirements to extend preference in employment to tribal members or Indian owned businesses. Further, lessees and operators within a Native American reservation may be subject to the pertinent Native American judiciary system, or barred from litigating matters adverse to the pertinent tribe unless there is a specific waiver of the tribe’s sovereign immunity. Therefore, we may be subject to various applicable laws and regulations pertaining to Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas operations within Native American reservations. One or more of these applicable regulatory requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or 
permits necessary to operate on tribal lands, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project with a Native American reservation. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that we will always be able to renew existing rights-of-way or obtain new rights-of-way in Native American lands without experiencing significant costs. For example, following a decision by the Federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals that relied, in part, on a previous Federal Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at one time owned by an individual Native American landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where an existing pipeline rights-of-way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operators.
In recent years, PHMSA and other federal agencies have reviewed the adequacy of transporting Bakken crude oil by rail transport and, as necessary have pursued rules to better assure the safe transport of Bakken crude oil by rail. For example, PHMSA adopted a final rule that includes, among other things, providing new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of Bakken crude oil transported. Additionally in 2016, PHMSA published a final rule mandating a phase-out schedule for all DOT-111 tank cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol, between 2018 and 2029 and, more recently in February 2019, PHMSA published a final rule requiring railroads to develop and submit comprehensive oil spill response plans for specific route segments traveled by a single train carrying 20 or more loaded tanks of liquid petroleum oil in a continuous block or a single train carrying 35 or more loaded tank cars of liquid petroleum oil throughout the train. Additionally, that February 2019 final rule requires railroads to establish geographic response zones along various rail routes, ensure that both personnel and equipment are staged and prepared to respond in the event of an accident and share information about high-hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions. We, as the owner of a Bakken crude loading terminal, may be adversely affected to the extent more stringent rail transport rules result in more significant operating costs in the shipment of Bakken crude oil by rail or as a result of delays or limitations of such shipments. 
Natural Gas Storage and Transportation 
Our equity investments’ natural gas pipelines used in gathering, storage and transportation activities are subject to regulation under NGPSA. On December 14, 2016, PHMSA issued final interim rules that impose new safety related requirements on downhole facilities (including wells, wellbore tubing and casing) of new and existing underground natural gas storage facilities. The final interim rules adopt and make mandatory two American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices that, among other things, address construction, maintenance, risk-management and integrity-management procedures. PHMSA indicated when it issued the interim final rule that the adoption of these safety standards for natural gas storage facilities represents a first step in a multi-phase process to enhance the safety of underground natural gas storage, with more standards likely forthcoming. However, in June 2017, PHMSA temporarily suspended specific enforcement actions pertaining to provisions that had previously been non-mandatory provisions prior to incorporation into the December 2016 interim final rule, as PHMSA announced it would reconsider the interim final rule. PHMSA re-opened the rule to public comment in October 2017. The Unified Agenda issued by the federal government published a July 2019 date for issuance of a final rule in replacement of this interim final rule but no final rule has yet been issued. At this time, we cannot predict the impact of any future regulatory actions in this area. To the extent we operate or manage natural gas storage facilities owned by our equity investments, we have evaluated the final interim rules and do not anticipate any significant impact on our equity investments or any significant increase in the costs of operating and maintaining natural gas storage facilities. 
The interstate natural gas storage and transportation operations of our equity investments are subject to regulation by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act. Subsidiaries of our Stagecoach Gas and Tres Holdings joint ventures are regulated by the FERC as natural gas companies. Under the Natural Gas Act, the FERC has authority to regulate natural gas transportation services in interstate commerce, which includes natural gas storage services. The FERC exercises jurisdiction over (i) rates charged for services and the terms and conditions of service; (ii) the certification and construction of new facilities; (iii) the extension or abandonment of services and facilities; (iv) the maintenance of accounts and records; (v) the acquisition and disposition of facilities; (vi) standards of conduct between affiliated entities; and (vii) various other matters. Regulated natural gas companies are prohibited from charging rates determined by the FERC to be unjust, unreasonable or unduly discriminatory, and both the existing tariff rates and the proposed rates of regulated natural gas companies are subject to challenge.
The rates and terms and conditions of our natural gas storage and transportation equity investments are found in the FERC-approved tariffs of (i) Stagecoach Pipeline & Storage Company LLC (Stagecoach Pipeline), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stagecoach Gas that owns the Stagecoach natural gas storage facility, the North-South Facilities and the MARC I Pipeline; (ii) Arlington Storage Company, LLC (Arlington Storage), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stagecoach Gas that owns the Thomas Corners, Seneca Lake and Steuben natural gas storage facilities; and (iii) Tres Palacios, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tres Holdings that owns the Tres Palacios natural gas storage facility. Stagecoach Pipeline, Arlington Storage and Tres Palacios are 
authorized to charge and collect market-based rates for storage services, and Stagecoach Pipeline is authorized to charge and collect negotiated rates for transportation services. Market-based and negotiated rate authority allows our equity investments to negotiate rates with individual customers based on market demand. A loss of market-based or negotiated rate authority or any successful complaint or protest against the rates charged or provided by our equity investments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Natural Gas Act to (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC rules, regulations and orders, up to approximately $1.3 million per day, per violation.
The interstate natural gas storage operations of our equity investments are also subject to non-rate regulation by various state agencies. For example, the NYSDEC has jurisdiction over well drilling, conversion and plugging in New York.  The NYSDEC, therefore, regulates aspects of the Stagecoach, Thomas Corners, Seneca Lake and Steuben natural gas storage facilities.
Marketing, Supply and Logistics
The transportation of crude oil, water and NGLs by truck is subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations, which are administered by the United States Department of Transportation, cover the transportation of hazardous materials. 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
Our operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge and emission of pollutants into the environment, environmental protection or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on our operations, including (i) the need to obtain permits to conduct regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; (iii) apply workplace health and safety standards for the benefit of employees; (iv) require remedial activities or corrective actions to mitigate pollution from former or current operations; and (v) impose substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the (i) assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; (ii) imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; (iii) occurrence of delays in permitting or the development of projects; and (iv) issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of the activities in a particular area. Failure to comply with such environmental laws and regulations can result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial liabilities, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in permitting, development or expansion of projects and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing federal environmental laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which our business operations and the operations of our equity investments are subject:
•The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes strict liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes;
•The Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, monitoring and reporting requirements and that serves as a legal basis for the EPA to adopt climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
•The Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
•The Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of substances into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources; 
•The National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment and which may require the preparation of Environmental Assessments or detailed Environmental Impact Statements, may be made available for public review and comment;
•The Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered or threatened species, or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal or permanent ban in affected areas; and
•The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances and appropriate control measures.
Certain of these federal environmental laws, as well as their state counterparts, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore properties where pollutants have been released regardless of whom may have caused the harm or whether the activity was performed in compliance with all applicable laws. States also adopt and implement their own environmental laws and regulations, which may be more stringent than federal requirements. In the course of our operations, generated materials or wastes may have been spilled or released from properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these materials or wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of the properties owned or leased by us were previously operated by third parties whose management, disposal or release of materials and wastes was not under our control. Accordingly, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up or remediating contamination arising out of our operations or as a result of activities by others who previously occupied or operated on properties now owned or leased by us. Private parties, including the owners of properties that we lease and facilities where our materials or wastes are taken for recycling or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages. We may not be able to recover some or any of these additional costs from insurance.
During 2014, we experienced three releases on our Arrow produced water gathering system that resulted in approximately 28,000 barrels of produced water being released on lands within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. In May 2015, we experienced another release of approximately 5,200 barrels of produced water, and during September 2019, we experienced two produced water releases totaling approximately 5,000 barrels. We are substantially complete with all remediation efforts related to these spills, have settled and paid all potential fines and penalties related to the 2015 water spills and we believe our remediation efforts are insurable events under our insurance policies. 
It is also possible that adoption of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent interpretation of existing environmental laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs or liabilities to us as well as the industry in general or otherwise adversely affect demand for our services. For example, In 2015, the EPA under the Obama Administration issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone more stringent. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone and, more recently, in August 2020, the EPA under the Trump Administration published notice of a proposed action that, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standards in accordance with Clean Air Act requirements, elected to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers' equipment, resulting in longer permitting timelines, and could significantly increase our or our customers' capital expenditures and operating costs. Also, in 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) under the Obama Administration released a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands; however, the 2015 rule was repealed by the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration in a final rule that became effective in December 2019 and they also published a final rule in April 2020 re-defining the term “waters of the United States” as applied under the Clean Water Act and narrowing the scope of waters subject to federal regulation. The April 2020 final rule is subject to various pending legal challenges and it is expected that the Biden Administration may reconsider this final rule. To the extent that the EPA and the Corps under the Biden Administration revises the June 2020 final rule in a manner similar to or more stringent than the original 2015 final rule, or if any challenge to the June 2020 final rule is successful and the 2015 final rule or a revised rule again expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, such developments could delay, restrict or halt permitting or development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our and our customers’ operations, which may reduce the rate of production from operators.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 731 full-time employees, 269 of which were general and administrative employees and 462 of which were operational employees. Our ability to attract, develop, retain and keep our employees safe is critical to the operational performance and future sustainability of our company. 
We believe our ability to attract employees is significantly influenced by our efforts to create a culture founded on respect and collaboration, and our ability to value the diverse backgrounds, skills and contributions that our employees offer. In 2020, we continued to take steps to advance our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) by developing a long-term D&I five-point plan with the key pillars of attracting talent for a diverse workforce, creating an inclusive and engaged workforce, focusing on sustainability and accountability, creating meaningful D&I-related partnerships, and building the future pipeline of employees with D&I in mind. In addition, we further advanced our D&I efforts by appointing a Chief Diversity Officer and participating in the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity and Inclusion during 2020. 
We develop our employees through a comprehensive performance management program and through continuous training, especially as it relates to safety, operations, technology, human resources and ethics. 99.96% of our employees completed their assigned training in these areas during the year ended December 31, 2020.
We monitor our ability to retain our employees through our voluntary turnover rate (the percentage of employees who voluntarily leave our organization compared to our total employee population), which was 8% during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 11% during the year ended December 31, 2019.
We monitor our ability to keep our employees safe by setting company-wide goals each year as it relates to leading indicators (i.e., near miss reporting, timely completion of compliance tasks, setting individual safety goals) and lagging indicators (i.e., incident and injury rates). These safety metrics are included in the annual compensation of our executives and employees, which are described in more detail in Part III, Item 11. Executive Compensation under Annual Incentive Compensation.
