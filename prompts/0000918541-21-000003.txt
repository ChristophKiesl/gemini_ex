Item 1.Business
Introduction
NN, Inc. is a global diversified industrial company that combines advanced engineering and production capabilities with in-depth materials science expertise to design and manufacture high-precision components and assemblies primarily for the electrical, automotive, general industrial, aerospace and defense, and medical markets. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”), the terms “NN,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to NN, Inc., and its subsidiaries. We have 32 facilities in North America, Europe, South America, and China.
On October 6, 2020, we completed the sale of our Life Sciences business (the “Life Sciences business”) to affiliates of American Securities LLC for approximately $753.3 million. The proceeds from the sale of the Life Sciences business were used to prepay $700.0 million in the aggregate on the Senior Secured Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan immediately following the sale. We also paid in full the outstanding balance on the Senior Secured Revolver. The sale of the Life Sciences business furthers management’s strategy to improve liquidity and creates the financial flexibility to pursue key growth areas in the Mobile Solutions and Power Solutions segments. 
Our enterprise and management structure is designed to accelerate growth and further balance our portfolio by aligning our strategic assets and businesses. Our businesses are organized into the Mobile Solutions and Power Solutions groups and are based principally on the end markets they serve. Mobile Solutions is focused on growth in the general industrial and automotive end markets. Power Solutions is focused on growth in the electrical and aerospace and defense end markets. 
Business Segments and Products
Mobile Solutions
Mobile Solutions is focused on growth in the general industrial and automotive end markets. We have developed an expertise in manufacturing highly complex, system critical components for fuel systems, engines and transmissions, power steering systems, and electromechanical motors on a high-volume basis. This expertise has been gained through investment in technical capabilities, processes and systems, and skilled program management and product launch capabilities.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions is focused on growth in the electrical and aerospace and defense end markets, while also serving the automotive and medical end markets. Within this group we combine materials science expertise with advanced engineering and production capabilities to design and manufacture a broad range of high-precision metal and plastic components, assemblies, and finished devices used in applications ranging from power control to flight control and for military devices. We 
manufacture a variety of products including electrical contacts, connectors, contact assemblies, and precision stampings for the electrical end market and high precision products for the aerospace and defense end market utilizing our extensive process technologies for optical grade plastics, thermally conductive plastics, titanium, Inconel, magnesium, and electroplating. Our medical business includes the production of a variety of tools and instruments for the orthopaedics and medical/surgical end markets.
Competitive Strengths
High-precision manufacturing capabilities
We believe our ability to produce high-precision parts at high production volumes is among the best in the market. Our technology platform consists of high precision machining, progressive stamping, injection molding, laser welding, material science, assembly, and design optimization. In-house tool design and process know-how create trade secrets that enable consistent production tolerances of less than one micron while producing millions of parts per day. Parts are manufactured to application-specific customer design and co-design standards that are developed for a specific use. The high-precision capabilities are part of our zero-defect design process which seeks to eliminate variability and manufacturing defects throughout the entire product lifecycle. We believe our production capabilities provide a competitive advantage as few other manufacturers are capable of meeting tolerance demands at any volume level requested by our customers. As the need for tight-tolerance precision parts, subassemblies, and devices continues to increase, we believe that our production capabilities will place us at the forefront of the industry. We have differentiated ourselves among our competitors by providing customers engineered solutions and a broad reach and breadth of manufacturing capabilities. We believe it is for these reasons, and because of our proven ability to produce high-quality, precision parts and components on a cost-effective basis, that customers choose us to meet their manufacturing needs.
Differentiated, system-critical products
The tight-tolerance and high-quality nature of our precision products is specifically suited for use in the most demanding applications that require superior reliability. Our products are critical components to the operation and reliability of larger mechanical systems. Precision parts are difficult to manufacture and achieve premium pricing in the marketplace as the high cost of failure motivates our customers to focus on quality. Our products are developed for specific uses within critical systems and are typically designed in conjunction with the system designer. Our parts are often qualified for, or specified in, customer designs, reducing the ability for customers to change suppliers.
Our ability to make products with tight-tolerance and extreme precision requirements enables our customers to satisfy the critical functionality and performance requirements of their products. We are included in customer designs and deployed in critical systems that involve high cost of failure applications and significant regulatory certification processes, including those for the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”), and the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (“NADCAP”).
Complete product lifecycle focus
Our engineering expertise and deep knowledge of precision manufacturing processes adds proprietary value throughout the complete lifecycle of our products. Our in-house engineering team works closely with our customers to provide parts that meet specific design specifications for a given application. The relationship with the customer begins early in the conceptual design process when we provide feedback on potential cost, manufacturability, and estimated reliability of the parts. Part designs are then prototyped, tested, and qualified in coordination with the customer design process before going to full-scale production. The close working relationship with our customers early in the product lifecycle helps to secure business, increase industry knowledge, and develop significant trade secrets. Performance verification, product troubleshooting, and post-production engineering services further deepen relationships with our customers as well as provide additional industry knowledge that is applicable to future design programs and provide continuous manufacturing process improvement.
Prototype products are developed for testing, and process validation procedures are instituted. In many instances, we will file for regulatory production approval and include the customer’s proprietary processes, further discouraging supplier changes. We will assist the customer with continuous supply chain management and comprehensive customer support for the lifetime of the product and continuously seek to identify new operational efficiencies to reduce the product’s cost and improve its quality. Once our solution is designed into a platform, it is often embedded through the multi-year manufacturing lifecycle and has a competitive advantage in supporting subsequent platforms. As an added benefit, customers generally fund development, prototypes, and manufacturing tooling expenses. This discourages supplier changes and drives recurring revenue for us.
Long-term blue-chip customer base
We maintain relationships with hundreds of customers around the world. Our customers are typically sophisticated, engineering-driven, mechanical systems manufacturers with long histories of product development and reputations for quality. 
We have no significant retail exposure, which limits volatility and provides enhanced sales visibility. Relationships with our top ten customers, in terms of revenue, average more than ten years. We have significant exposure to emerging markets in Asia, South America, and Europe through these global customers as well as key local manufacturers. The diverse nature, size, and reach of our customer base provides resistance to localized market and geographic fluctuations and help stabilizes overall product demand.
Strategic global footprint
Our 32 facilities, on four continents, are strategically located to serve our customer base and provide local service and expertise. Our global footprint provides flexibility to locally supply identical products for global customers, reducing shipping time and expense, allowing us to match costs to revenue and to capitalize on industry localization trends. In total, we operate more than 2.1 million square feet of manufacturing space. North America constitutes the largest portion of our manufacturing operations with facilities in the U.S. and Mexico. The North American facilities are strategically located to serve major customers in the United States and Mexico. Our foreign facilities are located in regional manufacturing hubs in France, Poland, China, and Brazil, and primarily serve global customers in those local markets. The Asian and South American facilities, we believe, have significant growth potential as local customer bases expand and the markets for high-precision products grow in those regions.
Synergies
We are well-positioned to take advantage of synergies between our Mobile Solutions and Power Solutions businesses as we expand new technologies in the electric vehicle, hybrid vehicle, and aerospace and defense markets.
Proven and experienced management team
Our management team has significant experience in precision manufacturing and the diversified industrial sector. Warren Veltman was named President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2019 and previously served as Executive Vice President of Mobile Solutions. Mr. Veltman joined us in 2014 as part of the Autocam acquisition, a business at which he had 30 years of experience in financial and operational leadership roles. Thomas DeByle joined NN and was named Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in August 2019. Mr. DeByle has extensive experience in finance leadership roles at global manufacturers and most recently served as Chief Financial Officer, Vice President and Treasurer of Standex International since 2008. John Buchan was named Executive Vice President of Mobile Solutions in September 2019 and Executive Vice President of Mobile Solutions and Power Solutions in November 2019. Mr. Buchan joined us in 2014 as part of the Autocam acquisition, a business at which he had 18 years of experience in operations. We believe that our current management team has the necessary talent and experience to profitably operate and grow the business.
Customers
Our products are supplied primarily to manufacturers for use in a broad range of industrial applications, including automotive; electrical; agricultural; construction; residential devices and equipment; aerospace and defense; medical; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; and fluid power and diesel engines. Sales to each of our top ten customers are made to multiple customer locations and divisions throughout the world. In 2020, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 45% of our net sales. In 2020, 70% of our products were sold to customers in North America, 8% to customers in Europe, 15% to customers in Asia, and the remaining 7% to customers in South America. 
We sell our products to most of our largest customers under either sales contracts or agreed upon commercial terms. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations when incurred to our customers in the form of changes in selling prices. We ordinarily ship our products directly to customers within 60 days, and in many cases, during the same calendar month of the date on which a sales order is placed. 
Sales and Marketing
A primary emphasis of our marketing strategy is to expand key customer relationships by offering high quality, high-precision, application-specific customer solutions with the value of a single supply chain partner for a wide variety of products and components. Due to the technical nature of many of our products, our engineers and manufacturing management personnel also provide technical sales support functions, while internal sales employees handle customer orders and other general sales support activities. Our marketing strategy is to offer custom manufactured, high quality, precision products to markets with high value-added characteristics at competitive price levels. This strategy focuses on relationships with key customers that require the production of technically difficult parts and assemblies, enabling us to take advantage of our strengths in custom product development, equipment and tool design, component assembly, and machining processes.
Human Capital Management 
Our business results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals. As of December 31, 2020, we employed a total of 3,081 full and part-time employees and 409 temporary workers, which includes approximately 1,460 employees in the U.S. and approximately 2,030 employees in other countries employed by our international subsidiaries. Of our total employment, approximately 14% are management employees and 86% are production employees. Our employees in the France, Brazil, and Brainin de Mexico plants are subject to labor council relationships that vary due to the diverse countries in which we operate. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and the unions that represent them.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and which comply with government orders in all the states and countries where we operate. In an effort to keep our employees safe and to maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of new health-related measures, including the requirement to wear face-masks at all times while on company property, temperature-taking protocols, increased hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures at all locations, social-distancing protocols, restrictions on visitors to our facilities, and limiting in-person meetings and other gatherings.
We believe diversity and inclusion are at the core of our values and strategic business priorities. Throughout our business, we champion equality, supporting parity for women and under-represented groups as we work to create ethical, safe, and supportive workplaces where our employees thrive. We believe a diverse and inclusive workplace results in business growth and encourages increased innovation, retention of talent, and a more engaged workforce. Respect for human rights is fundamental to our business and its commitment to ethical business conduct.
Competition
Mobile Solutions
In the market in which Mobile Solutions operates, internal production of components by our customers can impact our business as the customers weigh the risk of outsourcing strategically critical components or producing in-house. Our primary competitors are: Anton Häring KG; A. Berger Holding GmbH & Co. KG; Brovedani Group, Burgmaier Technologies GmbH & Co. KG; CIE Automotive, S.A.; IMS Companies; and MacLean-Fogg Component Solutions. We believe that we generally win new business on the basis of technical competence and our proven track record of successful product development.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions operates in intensely competitive but very fragmented supply chains.  We must compete with numerous companies in each industry market segment. Our primary competitors are: Checon Corporation; Deringer-Ney, Inc.; Electrical Contacts, Ltd.; Interplex Industries, Inc.; J&J Machining, LLC; Norstan, Inc.; Owens Industries, Inc.; and Precinmac Precision Machining. We believe that competition within the electrical and aerospace and defense end markets is based principally on quality, price, design capabilities, and speed of responsiveness and delivery.  We believe that our competitive strengths are product development, tool design, fabrication, tight tolerance processes, and customer solutions.  With these strengths, we have built our reputation in the marketplace as a quality producer of technically difficult products.
Raw Materials
Mobile Solutions
Mobile Solutions produces products from a wide variety of metals in various forms from various sources located in the North America, Europe, South America, and Asia.  Basic types include hot rolled steel, cold rolled steel (both carbon and alloy), stainless, extruded aluminum, die cast aluminum, gray and ductile iron castings, hot and cold forgings, and mechanical tubing. Some material is purchased directly under contracts, some is consigned by the customer, and some is purchased directly from the steel mills.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions uses a wide variety of metals in various forms, including precious metals like gold, silver, palladium, and platinum, as well as plastics. Through our diverse network of suppliers, we minimize supplier concentration risk and provide a stable supply of raw materials at competitive pricing.  This group also procures resins and metal stampings from several domestic and foreign suppliers. Power Solutions bases purchase decisions on quality, service and price.  Generally, we do not enter into written supply contracts with our suppliers or commit to maintain minimum monthly purchases of materials.  However, we carefully manage raw material price volatility, particularly with respect to precious metals, through the use of 
consignment agreements. In effect, we contract the precious metals for our own stock and buy the raw materials on the same day customer shipments are priced, thereby eliminating speculation.
In each of our segments, we have historically been affected by upward price pressure on steel principally due to general increases in global demand. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations to our customers in the form of changes in selling price. Most of the raw materials we use are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources, some of which are located in China and Europe. The recent coronavirus outbreak has impacted our suppliers in China and other affected regions. We are monitoring the effect of these impacts on our supply chain in order to maintain regular and timely supply of raw materials to our business segments. 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We have several U.S. patents, patent applications and trademarks for various trade names. However, we cannot be certain that we would be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties, and if we cannot do so, we may face increased competition and diminished net sales.
Furthermore, third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property, and we may have to pay substantial damages and/or redesign our products if we are ultimately found to infringe. Even if such intellectual property claims against us are without merit, investigating and defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.
Additionally, we rely on certain data and processes, including trade secrets and know-how, and the success of our business depends, to some extent, on such information remaining confidential. Each officer is subject to a non-competition and confidentiality agreement that seeks to protect this information. Additionally, all employees are subject to company code of ethics policies that prohibit the disclosure of information critical to the operations of our business.
Seasonal Nature of Business
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months as customers slow production, automotive sales tend to slow in July and December, and sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. However, as a whole, we are not materially impacted by seasonality.
Government Regulations
Our operations and products are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulatory requirements both domestically and abroad. For example, our business activities are subject to various laws and regulations relating to pollution control and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, discharges to air or water, the generation, storage, handling, and use of automotive hazardous materials and the handling and disposal of hazardous waste generated at our facilities. Under such laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for all the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We maintain a compliance program to assist in preventing and, if necessary, correcting environmental problems.
As a manufacturer of medical devices, our Taunton, Massachusetts, facility is required to register as such with the FDA. 
With respect to medical and products that we may specifically develop to sell to our customers, before these devices can be marketed, we will seek to obtain a marketing clearance from the FDA under Section 510(k) of the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA typically grants a 510(k) clearance if the applicant can establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Clearance under Section 510(k) typically takes about four months from the date of submission.
Based on information compiled to date, management believes that our current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  We cannot assure that currently unknown matters, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not materially affect our business or operations in the future.  As of the date hereof, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position. For additional information, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”
