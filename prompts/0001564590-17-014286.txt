Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule protease inhibitors. Our first product candidates are inhibitors of plasma kallikrein being developed for two indications: hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) and diabetic macular edema (“DME”). We apply our insights into the chemistry of proteases and, with our current programs, the biology of the plasma kallikrein system, to develop molecules with properties such as selectivity, potency and bioavailability that we believe will make them successful treatments for disease. 
 There is good evidence that inhibition of plasma kallikrein is able to treat HAE. Currently marketed therapies are all administered by injection and we anticipate considerable potential for orally delivered, small molecule treatments. In the case of DME, we are initially developing a plasma kallikrein inhibitor which is administered directly into the eye but anticipate ultimate development of orally delivered drugs. To achieve these aims we are advancing several proprietary product candidates into clinical trials. We began a first-in-human clinical trial of our first oral HAE candidate, KVD818, in the third calendar quarter of 2016 and plan to advance our lead DME candidate for intravitreal injection, KVD001, to Phase 2 trials later this year. We are currently progressing additional oral HAE candidates through preclinical studies and plan to take at least one of those into the clinic in 2017 and an additional program in 2018, in keeping with our strategy of developing a portfolio of molecules to yield a best-in-class therapy.

HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition with symptoms that include episodes of debilitating and often painful swelling in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. Prior clinical studies, including those for another currently marketed therapy have shown that inhibition of plasma kallikrein is a proven target in the treatment of HAE. A conveniently administered oral product could provide an opportunity to capture a significant portion of the current market and expand it to patients with less frequent HAE attacks.  
 We believe that HAE is a clinical indication and market that can be served by a focused commercial organization because there are a limited number of primary prescribers and active patient-focused disease organizations for this rare disease, which has a prevalence of between approximately 1 in 50,000 and 1 in 65,000 people. We intend to develop a portfolio of orally-delivered molecules, with the goal of providing a best-in-class therapeutic for this indication. For this reason, we anticipate advancing multiple molecules to early stage clinical trials, only selecting those that will be advanced further once we have sufficient data to allow comparisons of the molecules based upon a matrix of key criteria that we believe best reflect the unmet needs of patients with this disease. 
 DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in most developed countries and diabetes, the underlying cause of DME, is the leading cause of blindness among adults aged 20 to 74 years old, according to 2014 statistics published by the Center for Disease and Prevention. Our DME program is initially focused on the development of an intravitreally administered small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor. We believe intravitreal plasma kallikrein inhibitors may be an effective complementary therapy to vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF“) inhibitors and further improve visual acuity and decrease macular thickening. Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies have shown that direct injection into the eye delivers a high drug concentration at the desired site of action. The drug concentration is maintained for a prolonged period with a low systemic exposure, potentially supporting an extended dosing schedule. With our most advanced compound, KVD001, we have successfully completed a first-in-human trial in patients with DME and are planning for a multiple injection Phase 2 trial that we intend to commence later in 2017. In addition to KVD001, we also plan to develop an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor to treat DME. An oral treatment may provide the opportunity to reduce treatment burden, treat patients earlier in disease development, and provide a convenient and readily accessible treatment option for DME.
 Strategy 
 Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Apply our deep scientific expertise in the area of serine proteases to develop novel oral therapies for indications with high unmet need. Our core scientific team has decades of experience working on protease inhibitors and developing compounds with high potency, selectivity and bioavailability. We have assembled a team of chemists and biologists who have demonstrated the ability to design and formulate multiple drug candidate programs from a broad variety of chemical classes, as indicated by our extensive intellectual property portfolio. Our initial focus is specifically on development of plasma kallikrein inhibitors for HAE and DME; however, we believe our scientific capabilities also can be applied to other proteases to develop therapies for diseases with high unmet need and orphan indications.

• | Advance multiple HAE product candidates into clinical development. We intend to develop a best-in-class oral therapy for HAE and, to accomplish that goal, we plan to bring multiple drug candidates into clinical trials and compare their performance before determining which program, or programs, to advance to late stage development. Our first oral candidate, KVD818, is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials. We are conducting preclinical development of multiple additional drug candidates and plan to continue to advance those that meet our strict internal development criteria. We anticipate bringing one additional candidate into clinical development this year and at least one additional candidate in 2018.

• | Continue to advance our intravitreal DME program and develop an oral therapy. KVD001, our first product candidate to treat DME, has already been advanced into clinical trials and is anticipated to begin a Phase 2 trial later in 2017. We also intend to develop an oral therapy for this indication, which we believe could dramatically improve the standard of care for patients, since all current therapies are currently delivered by injection into the eye.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Grow our capabilities internally as well as through strategic partnerships. We intend to retain ownership and control of our pipeline programs to key milestones. For certain indications that can be addressed by a focused organization, such as HAE, we may determine to keep all program rights and develop capabilities such as sales and marketing capabilities. For programs that address larger markets or require greater infrastructure or resources, such as DME, we may seek a partner that can provide those capabilities. Decisions on whether, and when, to engage in partnerships or collaborations will be based upon our evaluations of the relative risks and rewards of those collaborations at each point in the development cycle.

Plasma Kallikrein in HAE and DME 
 Plasma kallikrein is a serine protease enzyme that is a key early mediator of inflammation and edema or swelling. The body modulates the inflammatory effects of plasma kallikrein through a circulating inhibitor protein called C1-esterase inhibitor (“C1-INH”). Patients with HAE have genetic mutations that lead to either a deficiency or non-functioning of C1-INH, which results in an inability to control activated plasma kallikrein in affected tissues. This excessive activation leads to inflammation, edema, and pain. 
 Published laboratory work has shown that the eye is also a site of increased plasma kallikrein in DME. In diabetic patients, the retina is one of a few tissues in which edema develops. Under normal circumstances the eye is protected from the diffusion of plasma proteins by an effective barrier. In diabetes this barrier becomes less effective and allows plasma kallikrein to enter the eye. While C1-INH will also be able to enter by the same route, animal models of DME have shown that the concentration of C1-INH in the vitreous fluid is insufficient to fully suppress the effects of plasma kallikrein on retinal edema. Over time, this edema leads to retinal damage that causes blindness. 
 Hereditary Angioedema 
 Disease Overview
 HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition that occurs in between about 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 65,000 people, according to multiple population-based epidemiological investigations. Excessive plasma kallikrein activation not sufficiently controlled by C1 inhibition leads to the typical HAE attack. HAE attacks include episodes of intense swelling or edema usually in the skin, gastrointestinal tract or airways. They often lead to temporary disfiguration of various body parts including the hands, feet, face, body trunk, and genitals. In addition, patients often have bouts of excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that is caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. 
 Most attacks occur spontaneously, with no apparent reason. However, anxiety, stress, minor trauma, surgery, or illnesses such as colds are often cited as prodromal events. Trauma to the oral cavity caused by dental procedures makes HAE patients particularly vulnerable to airway attacks. The frequency of HAE attacks is highly variable, with some patients having attacks several times per week and others very infrequently. Although life-threatening airway swelling is rare, at least half of HAE patients have experienced at least one such attack and airway attacks remain a major cause of mortality in HAE patients. The severity of attacks is unpredictable and not related to their underlying frequency. A patient with only one attack per year can nevertheless be at risk of suffering a laryngeal attack. 
 HAE is caused primarily by genetic defects or mutations in the gene that regulates C1inhibition and is an autosomal dominant disease meaning that a defect in only one copy of the gene leads to symptoms and that it occurs at similar rates in both males and females. While HAE can result through inheritance of a defective C1-INH gene from a parent, a number of cases also arise from novel mutations. 
 C1-INH is a natural plasma-borne peptide that functions as an inhibitor of multiple serine proteases in both the complement and kallikrein kinin systems. C1-INH is the predominant physiological inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, and thereby suppresses the generation of bradykinin, a potent hormone produced by plasma kallikrein, that activates its receptors on blood vessels to increase vascular leakage. Uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity leads to the tissue inflammation and edema that are the hallmarks of HAE. As such, plasma kallikrein is a clinically validated target for HAE and previous studies have demonstrated that plasma kallikrein inhibition can both treat and prevent HAE attacks.

Current Treatments and Market opportunities
 There are a number of marketed therapeutics for HAE which provide evidence that inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity will give therapeutic benefit in HAE. Most relevant is ecallantide (Kalbitor®) which is a small protein inhibitor of plasma kallikrein that is approved for acute attacks of HAE. While effective, ecallantide has been associated with cases of anaphylaxis and its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) includes a black box warning limiting its administration to healthcare professionals. Other therapies employ C1-INH replacement to control plasma kallikrein levels. Cinryze® and Berinert® are purified from human plasma, whereas Ruconest® is a recombinant product. Icatibant (Firazyr®) is a synthetic peptide-based antagonist that blocks the activity of bradykinin. All of these products are administered by injection, which is typically less convenient for patients and has the potential to reduce to compliance. We believe that a safe and effective oral agent has the potential to transform treatment for this disease. We also believe that opportunities exist for both acute and prophylaxis treatments, and intend to consider all of our programs as potential therapies in both segments of the market.  For this reason, we plan to evaluate multiple formulations and profiles of our programs as part of our clinical development strategy.
 Our Portfolio of HAE Programs
 KVD818 is the first of our portfolio of orally available plasma kallikrein inhibitors to progress to clinical testing. In common with other candidates it is a potent and selective inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein that displays properties which we believe support its investigation in early clinical trials to assess its suitability to progress to trials in HAE patients. We are currently studying KVD818 in a first-in-human study in the UK that has explored multiple doses and formulations.  To date, we have demonstrated that KVD818 achieves exposures in subjects and has been generally well-tolerated. We plan to continue to explore the properties of KVD818 to support decisions on further development as well as to enhance our knowledge of HAE therapy and inform our portfolio strategy. 
 We are developing additional program candidates in order to expand the universe of properties and increase the likelihood of delivery of a best-in-class treatment for HAE. The first of these additional product candidates is KVD900. Consistent with our strategy of progressing multiple candidates, we are preparing this molecule for clinical testing and plan to have enabled the first-in-human study before the end of the year. KVD900 is a potent inhibitor of plasma kallikrein displaying 50% inhibition with a concentration of 6nM, and shows very high selectivity against related proteases as shown in Table 1 below. Of particular note is that it is >6000 fold selective against tissue kallikrein (also called tissue kallikrein 1 or KLK1). This enzyme shares the same substrate as plasma kallikren and has been linked to effects on cardiac safety, making selectivity against it an important element of our design process. 
 
 
Enzyme (Human) | Fold selectivity
------------------+-----------------
Tissue Kallikrein | >6000 
Factor XIa | >6000 
Factor XIIa | >6000 
Plasmin | >6000 
Thrombin | >6000 
Trypsin | >6000 

 
Table 1: Selectivity of KVD900 against human proteases related to plasma kallikrein. 
 In ongoing preclinical safety studies, KVD900 is rapidly and highly absorbed. In rats, plasma concentrations up to 30,000-fold IC50 have been obtained within one hour following dosing and maintained well above IC50 for at least 24 hours. In addition, in non-animal safety studies to date, KVD900 has shown a profile consistent with progression to clinical studies. For example, the potential for a compound to affect, or be affected by, the dosing of another drug (drug-drug interaction), can be investigated by looking at its impact on the enzymes responsible for metabolizing drugs. In these assays against cytochrome P450 enzymes, KVD900 is >1000 fold less potent than it is against plasma kallikrein.

Manufacture of KVD900 has been completed at the multi-kilogram scale to support preclinical and clinical testing and multiple formulations have been developed, manufactured and dosed to primates establishing the feasibility of manufacture of clinically acceptable dose forms. These dose forms are designed to enable variable dosing regimens. 
 In parallel with progression of KVD900, we are not only focused on expansion of our proprietary compound portfolio but also our profiling techniques to enable a collection of molecules differentiated by both chemical structure and properties, maximizing the chance of discovering and progressing best-in-class treatments for HAE. Our scientific team has demonstrated the ability to consistently generate new candidate molecules, enabling a rigorous selection process that only advances programs that meet strict internal criteria. As part of this effort, we have developed assays that provide proprietary insights into inhibition of plasma kallikrein, supporting selection of product candidates at an earlier stage that may have a higher likelihood of demonstrating clinical success. A number of these earlier candidates are being profiled for progression to scale-up manufacture and entry into formal safety studies. 
 Diabetic Macular Edema 
 Disease Overview 
 DME occurs as a result of diabetes and is caused by the breakdown of the endothelial barrier function in the retina, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the macula. This leads to edematous thickening of the macula region of the retina and loss of visual acuity, potentially leading to blindness. DME is a major complication associated with diabetes, affecting an estimated 26% of type 1 diabetic patients after 14 years of the disease, and an estimated 29% within their lifetime; 17% of type 1 diabetic patients were estimated to develop clinically significant macular edema within their lifetime. Approximately 900,000 patients in the United States have active DME and are at serious risk of vision loss, according to a study published in 2015. 
 The current standard of care for DME in the United States is therapy directed against VEGF, a hypoxia-induced protein that stimulates the growth of blood vessels in the retina. FDA approved anti-VEGF therapies for DME are ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and aflibercept (Eylea®). Both of these products are administered via intravitreal injection at roughly monthly intervals. In addition to these two products, a large fraction of patients is treated with bevacizumab (Avastin®), another therapy that works through the same mechanism of binding to VEGF but has not been approved for ophthalmic use. Bevacizumab is priced based on its application in oncology and off-label use by retinal specialists typically results in treatment at a fraction of the cost seen with both ranibizumab and aflibercept. Patients are also treated with laser therapy in some circumstances.
 A number of other drug therapies are used to treat DME, including corticosteroid anti-inflammatories such as triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone, and dexamethasone. These drugs also are administered via intravitreal injection. Sustained release versions of fluocinolone (Illuvien®) and dexamethasone (Ozurdex®) have recently been approved for use in DME, substantially reducing the number of injections required to obtain and maintain clinical responses. These novel corticosteroid formulations led to 15-letter improvements in visual acuity in approximately 20-30% of patients. Corticosteroid treatment, however, is associated with a dramatic increase in cataract formation and a rise in intraocular pressure, reducing the attractiveness of these agents as potential therapies in many patients. 
 In a recent large, multi-center clinical trial in DME patients, anti-VEGF therapy led to approximately 20% of patients improving their visual acuity by 15 letters or more after a median of 9 or 10 intravitreal injections, leaving a significant portion of the patients with inadequate control of their disease. Further, in one study conducted for an approved VEGF inhibitor, 40% of patients displayed no visual improvement following anti-VEGF therapy after months of treatment. Unfortunately, even for those patients that do initially respond well to anti-VEGF therapy, their disease recurs within several months of treatment cessation, thus requiring extended rounds of intravitreal injections to achieve and maintain a clinical response. 
 Research into the biology underlying DME led by our scientific team has identified plasma kallikrein as a potential novel target for this indication. They found that plasma kallikrein levels were higher in vitreous fluid from DME patients compared to patients without diabetic retinopathy. They further found that targeted disruption of the gene for plasma prekallikrein or the administration of a small molecule plasma kallikrein inhibitor led to decreases 
 5

in retinal thickening in animal retinopathy models. We believe that inhibition of plasma kallikrein provides an opportunity to address DME through a novel mechanism that is independent of the current pathways targeted by anti-VEGF and steroid therapies. 
 Our DME Development Activities
 Our first potential DME therapy is KVD001.  KVD001 is a potent inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein with an IC50 of approximately 10nM and a high degree of selectivity against a broad range of other proteases.  We have developed KVD001 for intravitreal injection because trials using this delivery modality will provide a relatively early and direct proof of concept for its product candidate since the molecule is delivered directly to the site of edema. Since other products such as anti-VEGF therapies are also delivered intravitreally, we believe this will be accepted by both physicians and patients and will not lead to any competitive disadvantages. Another inherent advantage of intravitreal administration is that there is very limited systemic exposure, thus reducing potential systemic safety concerns.
 We have completed an open-label single ascending dose Phase 1 trial of KVD001 in 14 DME patients, all of whom had previously received anti-VEGF treatment. This trial investigated three doses of KVD001: 1, 3, and 10 µg/eye. While this trial was not powered to show statistically significant improvements in visual acuity, a pooled analysis of all patients and all doses demonstrates a trend toward improvement over time, with the mean change in visual acuity following a single dose of KDV001 of approximately four letters at 84 days following treatment. No adverse events were considered related to study drug at the low (n=3 patients) or high (n=8 patients) doses. At the mid-dose (n=3 patients) two adverse events were considered related to the study drug although both events were also considered related to study procedures. Those study procedures consist of intravitreal injection, which includes inherent risks such as intraocular inflammation, sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis, corneal decomposition, retinal detachment, and retinal tear. The first of these adverse events was a case of eye inflammation considered of mild intensity and possibly related to study drug and study procedure. The second was a case of increased intraocular pressure considered of severe intensity and related to study procedure and probably related to study drug. These results represent the first investigation of clinical application of plasma kallikrein inhibitors in DME and are an encouraging sign of the potential of KVD001, and plasma kallikrein inhibitors in general, in this indication. 
 Following this study, we conducted further preclinical testing to enable multiple monthly injections of KVD001, as well as allow concurrent treatment with both KVD001 and anti-VEGF therapies. We believe the ability to provide patients with multiple injections and longer duration of treatment may further enhance efficacy beyond that observed in the single dose Phase 1 trial. We are currently planning a Phase 2 trial of KVD001 administered by intravitreal injection in DME patients that will consist of four injections over a period of three months, and will include a control group. We intend to select patients who have previously been treated with anti-VEGF therapies but have experienced insufficient response. The primary outcome will be an increase in visual acuity following the final injection. We anticipate this trial will last approximately 12 months and currently plan to launch the trial later in 2017.
 Potential for Systemic Delivery 
 In parallel with the clinical development of its intravitreal product candidate KVD001, we intend to identify and advance plasma kallikrein inhibitors as oral therapies for DME. We believe that a safe and effective oral therapy has the potential to transform the treatment of DME which to-date has been dominated by drug therapies that must be injected intravitreally. Future trials in DME with oral kallikrein inhibitors may focus on the treatment of earlier stage disease, a stage at which intravitreal injections are not a desirable solution due to their inherently invasive nature and consequent risk of adverse reactions. Competition 
 In HAE, we expect to face competition from several FDA-approved therapeutics, including Cinryze, marketed by Shire in the United States and Europe for the prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents; Firazyr, marketed by Shire in the United States, Europe and certain other geographic territories for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients; Kalbitor, an injectable plasma kallikrein inhibitor marketed by Shire for the resolution of acute attacks in adolescent and adult HAE patients; Berinert and Haegarda, marketed by CSL Behring 
 6

for the prophylaxis and treatment of acute abdominal, facial or laryngeal attacks of HAE in adults and adolescents; and Ruconest, marketed by Pharming Group for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult patients. We are also aware of companies that are engaged in the clinical development of other product candidates, including a plasma kallikrein monoclonal antibody (SHP643, from Shire) and an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor (BCX7353, from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals ) for the treatment of HAE patients. 
 In DME, we expect to face competition from several FDA-approved therapeutics, including anti-VEGF therapies Lucentis, marketed by Roche and Novartis, Eylea, marketed by Regeneron, and off label use of Avastin from Roche. We also face competition from various corticoid steroids including extended release formulations lluvien, marketed by Alimera, and Ozurdex, marketed by Allergan. We further expect to compete with generic corticosteroids such as acetonide, fluocinolone, and dexamethasone and we are aware of a number of other companies that have product candidates in early clinical trials, including Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche, Regeneron, Ohr Pharmaceutical, Aerpio Therapeutics, Verseon, Thrombogenics and Allegro Ophthalmics. Verseon and Thrombogenics are also developing plasma kallikrein inhibitors for the treatment of DME by either topical administration (Verseon) or intravitreal injection (Thrombogenics). 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success substantially depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture our product candidates and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of April 30, 2017, we are the owner of five U.S. patents expiring between 2023 and 2034, absent any extensions, as well as four pending U.S. patent applications and five pending U.S. provisional applications. Any patents issuing from the foregoing owned or licensed U.S. applications are expected to expire in 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of April 30, 2017, we owned a total of 89 pending foreign applications and 89 patents in multiple jurisdictions. Any issued patents, or those issuing from these foreign patent applications, are expected to expire between 2023 and 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of April 30, 2017, we also controlled three pending international applications that, if issued, are expected to expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions. The chemical structures of KVD001 and KVD818 are included in composition of matter applications. 
 KVD001 is covered by U.S. patents and patent applications covering composition of matter, methods of treatment, solid form and clinical formulations. The anticipated expiration dates of these patents, or patents arising from applications, range from 2032 to 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. 
 Our portfolio of oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors, including KVD818 and KVD900, is covered by U.S. patent applications and pending international applications covering composition of matter and methods of treatment and any patents arising from those applications are expected to expire between 2034 to 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions. New U.S. provisional applications directed to solid forms and further compositions of matter were filed in 2016 and 2017. 
 In addition, we own a portfolio of patents and patent applications not related to the former Carbylan Therapeutics product candidates following the share purchase transaction with KalVista Pharmaceuticals Limited. As of April 30, 2017, this included seven granted U.S. patents expiring between 2028 and 2032, as well as three pending U.S. patent applications which would be expected to expire between 2030 and 2034. Also as of April 30, 2017, this portfolio included 22 pending foreign applications and 31 foreign granted patents. 
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection for our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We require our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention 
 7

agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive confidential information or materials. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 FDA approval process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDA”), warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence in the United States, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA approval requirements prior to marketing a pharmaceutical product typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical studies include evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and manufacturing process, as well as toxicity studies in animals to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices and good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with the information on product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the initial IND is “opened” (i.e. effective). For the initial IND submission, a 30-day waiting period after the submission of the IND is required prior to the commencement of the clinical trial in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. For subsequent clinical trial protocols submitted to the IND, there is no mandated review time for FDA. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard designed to protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects and to ensure the integrity of the clinical trial data generated; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for approval prior to the start of the clinical trial. An IRB may also order the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, optimization of the dose, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical and clinical data, including pharmacology and toxicology results, and the results of other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and once approved, the NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA. Priority review can be applied to a drug that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such additional data in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for the indication being supported. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) if it is considered that additional measures are needed to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include the use of medication guides and communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, a condition of the NDA approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. 
 Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

Foreign clinical studies to support an NDA
The FDA will accept as support for marketing approval of a product (NDA) well-designed, well-conducted, clinical studies conducted outside of the United States if the studies have been conducted in accordance with the exact same standards of GCP, as required in the United States, and the protocol was submitted to the IND. FDA may validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. Clinical studies conducted outside the United States are subject to the same rigorous regulatory controls as the United States (see  “— Europe / rest of world government regulation” below).
 A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical study to support an IND must submit the following supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the study conformed to GCP:
  
• | the investigator’s qualifications;
--+-----------------------------------


• | a description of the research facilities;
--+------------------------------------------


• | a detailed summary of the protocol and study results and, if requested, case records or additional background data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of the drug substance and drug product, including the components, formulation, specifications, and, if available, the bioavailability of the drug product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the name and address of the independent ethics committee that reviewed the study and a statement that the independent ethics committee meets the required definition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a summary of the independent ethics committee’s decision to approve or modify and approve the study, or to provide a favorable opinion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how informed consent was obtained;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | a description of what incentives, if any, were provided to subjects to participate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how the sponsors monitored the study and ensured that the study was consistent with the protocol;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how investigators were trained to comply with GCP and to conduct the study in accordance with the study protocol; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a statement on whether written commitments by investigators to comply with GCP and the protocol were obtained.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug products intended to treat a rare disease or condition. This is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
 A request for orphan drug designation must be submitted and approved prior to submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process of an NDA. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a drug product containing a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a drug product containing the same active moiety for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from 
 10

approving a drug product containing a different active moiety for the same disease or condition, or the same drug product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA user fee. 
 Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug product is safe and effective. A Pediatric Submission Plan (“PSP”) must be submitted to FDA for review at the latest 60 days following the End of Phase 2 meeting. The PSP will include a full pediatric clinical development plan, or a request for full or partial waiver, or a deferral, for conducting pediatric clinical trial data. The FDA reviews and approves the PSP, or will request amendments to the plan. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug product manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if we encounter problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 Other U.S. healthcare laws and compliance requirements 
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. 
 11

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. 
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (“ACA”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti- Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below). 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. 
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which it conducts business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of 
 12

covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 Coverage, pricing and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which it receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates 
 13

may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and it expects will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare reform 
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. 
 Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

 
• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In addition, the current administration and Congress will likely continue to seek legislative and regulatory changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the ACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In March 2017, following the passage of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would have amended or repealed significant portions of the ACA. We believe the U.S. Senate is unlikely to adopt the American Health Care Act as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. However, the U.S. Senate could adopt the American Health Care Act as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives or other legislation to amend or replace elements of the ACA. It is uncertain whether the American Health Care Act will become law. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our products, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 Additional regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of 
 15

various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 Europe / rest of world government regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union (“EU”), for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Other regulations 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
 Employees 
 As of April 30, 2017, we had a total of 28 full-time employees, of whom 10 were located in the United States and 18 were located in the United Kingdom. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and consider our relations with employees to be good.
