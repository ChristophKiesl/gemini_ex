ITEM 1.          Business
Our Company
 The “Company,” “Live Ventures,” “we,” “our,” and “us” are used interchangeably to refer to Live Ventures Incorporated and its subsidiaries, as appropriate in the context.
 Live Ventures Incorporated, a Nevada corporation originally incorporated in the State of New Mexico in 1968 as Nuclear Corporation of New Mexico, is a publicly traded (NASDAQ: LIVE) holding company for diversified businesses. In fiscal year 2015, we commenced a strategic shift in our business plan away from solely providing online marketing solutions for small and medium business to acquiring profitable companies in various industries that have demonstrated a strong history of earnings power. Under the Live Ventures brand, we seek opportunities to acquire profitable and well-managed companies. We work closely with third parties to help us identify target companies that fit within the criteria we have established for opportunities.
 Our operating businesses are generally managed on a decentralized basis. There are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by the Company’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. Live Ventures’ corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities, and the selection of the Chief Executive Officer to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Live Ventures’ corporate governance practices, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed.

 ApplianceSmart
 ApplianceSmart is a household appliance retailer in Columbus, Ohio with two product categories: one consisting of typical and commonly available, innovative appliances, and the other consisting of affordable value-priced, niche offerings such as close-outs, factory overruns, discontinued models, and special-buy appliances, including open box merchandise and others.  One example of a special-buy appliance may be due to manufacturer product redesign, in which a current model is updated to include a few new features and is then assigned a new model number. Because many of the major manufacturers ship only the latest models to retailers, a large quantity of the previous models often remain in the manufacturers' inventories. Special-buy appliances typically are not integrated into the manufacturers’ normal distribution channels and require a different method of management, which we provide. For many years, manufacturers relied on small appliance dealers to buy these specialty products to sell in their stores.  However, today, small retailers are struggling to compete with large appliance chains as the ten largest retailers of major appliances account for more than 85% of the sales volume.  At the same time, expansion of big-box retailers that sell appliances has created an increase in the number of special-buy units, further straining the traditional outlet system for these appliances. Because these special-buy appliances have value, manufacturers and retailers need an efficient management system to recover their worth.
 
There are no guarantees on the number of units any of the manufacturers will sell to us. However, we believe purchases from these manufacturers will provide an adequate supply of high-quality appliances for our ApplianceSmart store.
 
On December 9, 2019, ApplianceSmart filed a voluntary petition (the “Chapter 11 Case”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”), seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). The bankruptcy affects Live Ventures’ indirect subsidiary ApplianceSmart only and does not affect any other subsidiary of Live Ventures, or Live Ventures itself. ApplianceSmart expects to continue to operate its business in the ordinary course of business as debtor-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, ApplianceSmart reserves its right to file a motion seeking authority to use cash collateral of the lenders under its reserve-based revolving credit facility. The Chapter 11 Case is being administrated under the caption, In re: ApplianceSmart, Inc. (Case Number 19-13887). Court filings and other information related to the Chapter 11 Case are available at the PACER Case Locator website for those registered to do so or at the Courthouse located at One Bowling Green, Manhattan, New York 10004.

Vintage Stock. According to the Entertainment Software Association, today’s video games provide rich, engaging entertainment for players across all platforms. The 2020 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry Report (the “Video Game Industry Report”) underscores how video games have evolved into a mass medium, noting that over 164 million adults in the United States play video games, and three-quarters of Americans

have at least one gamer in their household. In addition, an article on Dec 3, 2020 from the Entertainment Software Association shows the U.S. Video game industry in 2019 generated $90.3 billion in annual economic output. The video game industry generates $12.6 billion in federal, state and local taxes annually.
 According to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), the following statistics show the benefits of video games. The average age of players has expanded to the 35-44 age group. This shows that growing numbers across age and gender are finding positive benefits of video game play. 64% of American adults play video games up from 45% in 2015. 80% of players say video games provide mental stimulation and 79% say they provide relaxation and stress relief.  Video games are used to connect people and families. Sixty five percent say they play online or in person with other players. More than half of parents say they play games with their children.
 Competition
 Vintage Stock. Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. Competition is based on the ability to adopt new technology, aggressive franchising, establishment of brand names and quality of collections. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. We have, however, established a presence in areas where we can take a greater portion of market share. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.
 ApplianceSmart. ApplianceSmart’s competition comes primarily from new-appliance and other special-buy retailers. Our ApplianceSmart store competes with local retail appliance chains, as well as with independently owned retailers. Many of these retailers have been in business longer than us and may have significantly greater assets. Many factors, including obtaining adequate resources to create and support the infrastructure required to operate large-scale appliance recycling and replacement programs, affect competition in the industry.

The transaction value under the Purchase Agreement was approximately $14.0 million. Following the closing of the transaction, Lonesome Oak agreed to lease back from the LOTC Shareholder certain properties owned by affiliates of the LOTC Shareholder that are used in Lonesome Oak’s operations. Marquis held back $1.45 million of the purchase price (the “Holdback Amount”) to satisfy claims for indemnity arising out of breaches of certain representations, warranties, and covenants, and certain other enumerated items. In connection with the closing of the transaction, the LOTC Shareholder entered into an employment agreement with a five-year term and agreed to serve as Lonesome Oak’s Executive Vice President pursuant to the terms thereof. Subject to certain exceptions, the LOTC Shareholder has agreed to indemnify Marquis for breaches of certain representations, warranties, and covenants contained in the LOTC Purchase Agreement, and certain other enumerated items, if any.

Indemnification by the LOTC Shareholder for breaches of certain representations and warranties is generally limited to the Holdback Amount. The LOTC Purchase Agreement contains a three-year non-competition covenant and non-solicitation covenant that apply to the LOTC Shareholder. On March 2, 2020, Lonesome Oak merged with and into Marquis, with Marquis surviving the merger and Lonesome Oak ceasing to exist as a separate entity.

Our Market
 Carpet and Rugs
 The carpet and rug industry had shipments of $11.5 billion in 2019. The carpet and rugs industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up the largest portion of the industry. The industry has two primary sub-markets, replacement and new construction, with the replacement market making up the larger portion of the sub-markets. Approximately 59% of industry shipments are made in response to residential replacement demand.
 Residential products consist of broadloom carpets and rugs in a broad range of styles, colors and textures. Commercial products consist primarily of broadloom carpet and modular carpet tile for a variety of institutional applications including office buildings, restaurant chains, schools and other commercial establishments. The carpet industry also manufactures carpet for the automotive, recreational vehicle, small boat and other industries.
 The Carpet and Rug Institute (the “CRI”) is the national trade association representing carpet and rug manufacturers. Information compiled by the CRI suggests that the domestic carpet and rug industry is comprised of fewer than 100 manufacturers, with a meaningful percentage of the industry's production concentrated in a limited number of manufacturers focused on the lower end of the price curve.
 Hard Surfaces
 Hard flooring surfaces such as ceramic, luxury vinyl tile, hardwood, stone, and laminate had shipments of $15.5 billion in 2019. As with carpet and rugs, the market is split between residential and commercial and replacement and new construction, with residential replacement being the largest segment of the market.
