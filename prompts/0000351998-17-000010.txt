This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Data I/O Corporation’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Forward Looking Statements.”
 
General
 
Data I/O Corporation (“Data I/O”, “We”, “Our”, “Us”) is a global market leader for advanced programming and associated intellectual property management solutions used in the manufacturing of flash memory, microcontrollers, and flash-memory-based intelligent devices.  Data I/O® designs, manufactures and sells programming systems for electronic device manufacturers, specifically targeting high growth areas such as high-volume users of flash memory and microcontrollers.  Most electronic products today incorporate one or more programmable semiconductor devices that contain data and operating instructions essential for the proper operation of the product.
 
Our mission is to deliver high-value systems, software and services to the expanding programmable semiconductor market by providing a software-rich programming platform for secure content delivery.  Programmable devices are used in products such as automobile electronics, smartphones, HDTV, tablets and gaming systems.  Our solutions, some of which include intellectual property management, secure content management and process control capabilities, enable us to address the demanding requirements of the electronic device market, where applications and intellectual property protection are essential to our customer’s success.  Our largest customers are heavy users of programmable semiconductor devices and include original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in automotive electronics, consumer electronics and Internet of Things ("IoT") and their programming center partners, wireless and electronic manufacturing service (“EMS”) contract manufacturers.
 
Data I/O was incorporated in the State of Washington in 1969 and its business was founded in 1972.
 
Industry Background
 
We enable companies to improve productivity, increase supply chain security and reduce costs by providing device programming solutions that allow our customers to take intellectual property (large design and data files) and protect and program it into memory, microcontroller and logic devices quickly and cost-effectively.  We also provide services related to hardware support, system installation and repair, and device programming.  Companies that design and manufacture products utilizing programmable electronic devices, ranging from automobiles to cell phones, purchase programming solutions from us.  Trends of increasing device densities, shrinking device packages, increased demands for security, and customers increasing their software content file sizes, combined with the increasing numbers of intelligent devices such as automotive electronics and IoT applications, are driving demand for our solutions.
 Traditionally, our programming market opportunity focused on the number of semiconductor devices to be programmed, but because of the rapid increase in the density of devices, and increasing demands for supply chain security, the focus has shifted in many cases from the number and type of devices to the number and type of bits per device to be programmed. With expected growth in IoT applications, the business opportunity for this market differentiates on quality, security and automation.
 
Some of our automated programming systems integrate both data programming, and automated handling functions into a single product solution.  Moving forward, we anticipate integrating security provisioning as well. Quality conscious customers, particularly those in high-volume manufacturing and programming, continue to drive this portion of our business.
 
Products
 
In order to accommodate the expanding variety and quantities of programmable devices being manufactured today, we offer multiple solutions for the numerous types of device mix and volume usage by our customers in the various market segments and applications.  We work closely with leading manufacturers of programmable devices to develop our products  to meet the requirements of a particular device.  Our newer products are positioned and recognized as some of the most advanced programming equipment and associated intellectual property management solutions.

Our solutions address the programming of devices.  Semiconductor devices are a large, growing market, both in terms of devices and bits programmed.  We believe that our sales are driven by many of the same forces that propel the semiconductor industry.  We sell to the same firms that buy the semiconductors.  When their business grows, they buy more semiconductors which, in turn, require additional programming equipment to maintain production speeds or program new device technologies, driving demand for our products or alternative programming methods.
 
Our device programming solutions currently target two high growth, high volume markets: automotive electronics and IoT systems including Industrial and Consumer devices. 
 
We have derived estimates of the size of the pre-programming served available market that our programming systems address.  In 2015, we believed this market was expected to double during the period from 2015-2020 based on BI Intelligence estimates of IoT Unit Growth and key automotive electronics forecasts.  These forecasts include: Global Automotive Infotainment Operating System Sales Forecast by IHS Automotive, showing unit growth doubling over four years, as well as OEM Light Vehicle ADAS (Advanced Driver Assist Systems) Spend by Strategy Analytics for spending growth projected by year through 2021.  While we have not updated our market model this year, the continued strong order demand in 2016, particularly in Automotive Electronics, is consistent with the 2015 model.  Based on these market forecasts and assuming sustained capital spending in our other pre-programming market sectors, we believe we are well-positioned for growth.
 
Growth drivers for automotive electronics 
 ·        Consumers desire advanced car features requiring higher levels of sophistication including infotainment products (audio, radio, dashboard displays, navigation and wireless connectivity) as well as increased safety features and optimized engine functionality
 ·         Increasing numbers and size of microcontrollers per vehicle
 ·         Proliferation of programmable microcontrollers to support the next-generation electronic car systems
 ·         Increasing use of high-density flash to provide memory for advanced applications that require programming
 ·         Increasing complexity to support autonomous vehicles
 ·         Increasing need for security solutions for a secure supply chain and lifecycle firmware integrity
 
Growth drivers for IoT: including industrial and consumer devices 
 ·         Securely controlling groups of connected devices through a secure supply chain and lifecycle firmware integrity
 ·         Adding intelligence and processing into devices
 ·         Connecting previously unconnected devices to networks and the internet (such as intelligent thermostats and lighting)
 ·         Emergence of new devices and applications (such as wearables)

 2015       Four customers accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2015: Data Copy Limited, our distributor in China, LeChamp, our distributor in south-east Asia, and Flextronics and Arrow, our direct customers, represented 24%, 13%, 12% and 11% of that balance, respectively.
 2014       No customers represented greater than 10% of our consolidated accounts receivable.
 
Geographic Markets and Distribution
 
We market and sell our products through a combination of direct sales, internal telesales and indirect sales representatives and distributors.  We continually evaluate our sales channels against our evolving markets and customers and realign them as necessary to ensure that we reach our existing and potential customers in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
 
U.S. Sales
 
We market our products throughout the U.S. using a variety of sales channels, including our own field sales management personnel, independent sales representatives and direct telesales.  Our U.S. independent sales representatives obtain orders on an agency basis, with shipments made directly to the customer by us.  Net sales in the United States for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were (in millions) $2.9, $2.2 and $2.1, respectively.  Some of our customer’s orders delivered internationally are heavily influenced by U.S. sales based efforts.
 
International Sales
 
International sales represented approximately 88%, 90% and 90% of net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  We make foreign sales through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Germany and China, as well as through independent distributors and sales representatives located in 47 other countries.  Our independent foreign distributors purchase our products for resale and we generally recognize the sale at the time of shipment to the distributor.  As with U.S. sales representatives, sales made by international sales representatives are on an agency basis, with sales made directly to the customer by us.  
 
Net international sales for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were (in millions) $20.5, $19.8 and $19.8, respectively.  We determine international sales by the international geographic area into which the products are sold and delivered, and include not only sales by foreign subsidiaries but also export sales from the U.S. to our foreign distributors and to our representatives’ customers.  International sales do not include transfers between Data I/O and our foreign subsidiaries.  Export sales are subject to U.S. Department of Commerce regulations.  We have not, however, experienced difficulties to date as a result of these requirements.  We have not made sales to Iran or any Iranian governmental entities or any other blacklisted companies or countries.
 
Fluctuating exchange rates and other factors beyond our control, such as international monetary stability, tariff and trade policies and U.S. and foreign tax and economic policies, may affect the level and profitability of international sales.  We cannot predict the effect of such factors on our business, but we try to consider and respond to changes in these factors, particularly as the majority of our costs are U.S. based while the vast majority of our sales are international.
 
Competition
 
The competition in the programming systems market is highly fragmented with a small number of organizations selling directly competitive solutions and a large number of smaller organizations offering less expensive solutions.  In particular, low cost automated solutions have gained market share in recent years, where the competition is primarily based on price.  Typically, their equipment meets a “good enough” standard, but with reduced quality, traceability, security and other software features such as factory integration software.  Many of these competitors compete on a regional basis, with local  language and support.

In addition, we compete with multiple substitute forms of device programming including “home grown” solutions.  Programming after device placement may be done with In System Programming (“ISP”).  Some automotive products may also be programmed over the air (“OTA”).  IoT devices may also be programmed with ISP or OTA.  In addition, new security devices may be required to be programmed using device-specific programmers developed by the semiconductor manufacturer.  
 
While we are not aware of any published industry market information covering the programming systems market, according to our internal analysis of competitors’ revenues, we believe we continue to be the largest competitor in the programming systems equipment market and have been gaining market share especially with our new products.
 
Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Backlog
 
We strive to manufacture and provide the best solutions for advanced programming.  We primarily assemble and test our products at our principal facilities in Redmond, Washington and Shanghai, China. We outsource our circuit board manufacturing and fabrication.  We use a combination of standard components, proprietary custom integrated circuits (“ICs”) and fabricated parts manufactured to our specifications.  Most components used are available from a number of different suppliers and subcontractors but certain items, such as some handler and programmer subassemblies, custom integrated circuits, hybrid circuits and connectors, are purchased from single sources.  We believe that additional sources can be developed for present single-source components without significant difficulties in obtaining supplies.  We cannot be sure that single-source components will always continue to be readily available.  If we cannot develop alternative sources for these components, or if we experience deterioration in relationships with these suppliers, there may be price increases, minimum order quantities, costs associated with integrating alternatively sourced parts, and delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.
 
In accordance with industry practices, generally all orders are subject to cancellation prior to shipment without penalty, except for contracts calling for custom configuration.  To date, such cancellations have not had a material effect on our sales volume.  To meet customers’ delivery requirements, we manufacture certain products based upon a combination of backlog and anticipated orders.  Most orders are scheduled for delivery within 1 to 90 days after receipt of the order.  Our backlog of pending orders was approximately $3,200,000, $700,000, and $1,900,000 as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  The size of backlog at any particular date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of the trend of our business.
 
Research and Development
 
We believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our future success.  We continue to develop new technologies and products and enhance existing products.  Future growth is, to a large extent, dependent upon the timely development and introduction of new products, as well as the development of algorithms to support the latest programmable devices.  Where possible, we may pursue partnerships and other strategic relationships to add new products, capabilities and services.  We are currently focusing our research and development efforts on strategic growth markets, including automotive electronics and the IoT. We are developing technology to securely program new categories of semiconductors, including Secure Elements, Authentication Chips, and Secure Microcontrollers. We plan to deliver new programming technology and automated handling systems for managed and secure programming in the manufacturing environment.  We also continue to focus on increasing our capacity and responsiveness for new device support requests from customers and programmable integrated circuit manufacturers by revising and enhancing our internal processes and tools.  Our research and development efforts have resulted in the release of significant new products and product enhancements over the past several years.
 
During 2016, 2015, and 2014, we made expenditures for research and development of (in millions) $5.1, $4.7, and $4.7, respectively, representing 21.6%, 21.4%, and 21.5% of net sales, respectively.  Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred.
 
Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill, to establish and protect our market position.  We continue to apply for and add new patents to our patent portfolio as we develop strategic new technologies.
 
 8
 

 We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software, including LumenX software, Flashcore software, TaskLink software, ConneX™ smart programming software, Factory Integration software and other software products, by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements.  Our software products are not typically sold separately from sales of programming systems.  However, on those occasions where software is sold separately, revenue is recognized when a sales agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
 
Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.  As of December 31, 2016, there were no pending actions regarding infringement claims.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 91 employees, of which 43 were located outside the U.S. and 8 of which were part time.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand and for special projects.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable.  In foreign countries we have employment agreements or, in China, the Shanghai Foreign Services Co., Ltd. (“FSCO”) labor agreement.
Environmental Compliance
 
Our facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials or otherwise relating to the environment.  Compliance with environmental laws has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial position, results of operations or competitive position.
