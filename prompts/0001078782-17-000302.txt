BUSINESS

Description of Our Business 

Volition is a multi-national life sciences company developing simple, easy to use blood-based tests to accurately diagnose a range of cancers. The tests are based on the science of Nucleosomics®, which is the practice of identifying and measuring nucleosomes in the bloodstream or other bodily fluid - an indication that disease is present.
 
As cancer screening programs become more widespread, our products aim to assist in diagnosing a range of cancers quickly, simply, accurately and cost effectively. Early diagnosis has the potential to not only prolong the life of patients, but also to improve their quality of life.

Volition's research and development activities are currently centered in Belgium, with additional smaller offices in London, New York, Texas and Singapore. The Companys focus is to bring its diagnostic products to market first in Europe, then to some markets in Asia, the U.S. and ultimately, worldwide. 

We are transitioning from a purely clinical stage company to a commercialized company with the achievement of the CE Mark for our first product, the Nu.QTM   Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test in December 2016. We will continue to research and develop additional assays and products across a range of cancers as we continue to develop our commercial operations.

Research & Development

We are developing blood-based tests for the most prevalent cancers, beginning with colorectal cancer, or CRC. Following CRC, we anticipate focusing on lung cancer, prostate and pancreatic cancer, using our Nucleosomics® biomarker discovery platform. Our development pipeline includes assays to be used for symptomatic patients or asymptomatic (screening) populations. The platform employs a range of simple Nu.QTM immunoassays on an industry standard ELISA format, which allows rapid quantification of epigenetic changes in biofluids (whole blood, plasma, serum, sputum, urine etc.) compared to other approaches such as bisulfite conversion and polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. Nu.QTM biomarkers can be used alone, or in combination to generate profiles correlated with specific conditions. 

We have developed thirty-nine blood-based assays to date to detect specific biomarkers that can be used individually or in combination to generate a profile which forms the basis of a product for a particular cancer or disease. 

We anticipate that because of their ease of use and cost efficiency, our tests have the potential to become the first method of choice for cancer diagnostics, allowing detection of a range of cancers at an earlier stage than typically occurs currently, and testing of individuals who, for reasons such as time, cost or aversion to current methods, are not currently being tested. We believe our frontline blood test for CRC has the potential to have significantly higher compliance from patients compared to fecal tests and colonoscopies which are invasive and/or unpleasant. Our frontline blood test, currently in development, could be of significant benefit to approximately 148 million 50-74 year olds in the European Union that, according to the available data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Union recommends be screened for CRC. 
 
2

We focused our early trials in Europe given that our laboratories are based in Belgium and that we have strong relationships with world class collaborators in the region. All research and development operations are currently in Belgium due to its favorable environment for small companies including a well-trained technical work force, low cost quality research facilities and access to government support, such as some of our funding from the Walloon Region.

We have collaborated with Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen in Denmark for many years. We have access to two sample sets - a 14,000 CRC screening cohort and a 4,800 patient cohort with symptoms indicative of CRC. We have also started a prospective longitudinal study of 30,000 subjects with Hvidovre Hospital. In this prospective longitudinal study we will initially gain access to one blood sample from each subject, who screened negative for CRC in a national fecal CRC screening test. We also have an option to collect a further 60,000 blood samples (two blood samples from each of the same 30,000 subjects at two year intervals), commencing in late 2018. All blood samples will be accompanied by up to 120 clinical information data points, including lifestyle factors and a wide range of other diseases, allowing us to use the study in the context of other cancers/diseases. 

Regulatory Approach

Commercialization of our future products in the clinical in-vitro diagnostics, or IVD, market (e.g. for patient diagnosis in hospitals, clinics, etc.), requires government approval (CE Marking in Europe, FDA approval in the United States and Chinese Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, approval in China). 

In the United States, we anticipate that our tests will have to be cleared through the United States Food and Drug Administrations, or FDAs, premarket notification, or 510(k), process or its premarket approval, or PMA, process. The determination of whether a 510(k) or a PMA is necessary will depend in part on the proposed indications for use and the FDAs assessment of the risk associated with the use of the IVD for a particular indication. A similar system operates in China through the CFDA. In the European Union, our tests can be marketed after a declaration and marking that the test conforms to the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation, or CE Marking. The CE Mark is also recognized in certain Asian territories, including India, for the private payer market.

We obtained our first CE Mark in September 2015, for a single biomarker for CRC, and two further CE Marks in April 2016, for two biomarkers for CRC and pancreatic cancer. In December 2016, we achieved a CE Mark for our first product  the Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test. 

We are currently working on different products such as a frontline screening test and a symptomatic test for CRC. We expect that we will be required to perform additional clinical trials in the United States to obtain FDA clearance or approval for these CRC tests. We are committed to obtaining FDA clearance or approval to allow patient access to our tests in the United States as soon as practicable. We intend to initiate the 510(k) and the PMA process in 2017. 

We also expect that we will be required to do trials in China to achieve CFDA approval for our various tests, provided we can ensure adequate protection of our intellectual property in China. Local validation studies will be required to support sales of our CE Marked CRC test in many Asian markets for the private payer market. We plan to seek distribution partners for the major Asian markets. 

Our Nucleosomics® biomarker platform is a technology that can potentially be used for a wide variety of cancers. We are currently developing Nucleosomics® tests for a number of major cancers including CRC, pancreatic, lung and aggressive prostate. 

The Market 

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for around 8.2 million annual deaths globally. In the United States alone, there were an estimated 13.8 million cancer survivors in 2010. By 2020, this figure is expected to rise to 18.1 million. The Agency for Healthcare research and Quality estimated the health economic burden for cancer relating to direct medical costs at approximately $88.7 billion for 2011. The annualized cost of cancer care based on analysis of Medicare payments linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data is projected to reach $157 billion by 2020. These figures are mirrored across the globe and we expect they will continue to grow as populations age. This is a large potential addressable market for which we believe early diagnosis will play a significant part. Incidence of, and mortality due to, CRC in the U.S. have been steadily falling since the mid-1980s with an acceleration of reduction in both men (3% per annum) and women (2.3% per annum) over the last 15 years. This is largely due to early detection and removal of polyps via colonoscopy. The Papanicolaou (Pap) test has had a similar impact in improving 5-year survival rates in women with precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions.
 
3

Statistically, the chances of surviving cancer are greatly improved by early detection and treatment. However, there are currently very few blood tests for diagnosis of cancer in common clinical use. The only blood test commonly used for screening any cancer is the Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, test for prostate cancer. We consider the PSA test to have relatively poor diagnostic accuracy (detecting approximately 70% of prostate cancers and misdiagnoses of about 30% of healthy men as positive for cancer) but it is widely used because it is the best product currently available. This test is intended to be used to monitor patients after definitive diagnosis or treatment. The American Cancer Society recommends that prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision making process regarding risks. In 2012, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommended against PSA-based screening for healthy men because of a moderate or high probability that the service has no benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. There are currently no commonly used approved blood tests for screening for lung, pancreatic or CRC.

Further, current methods of cancer diagnosis are either invasive, not cost effective, have low acceptance or cannot provide accurate results. The inadequacy of existing diagnostic products means that most cancers are only diagnosed once the patient experiences symptoms and the cancer is well established. By this stage, it will often have spread beyond the primary tumor (metastatic cancers), making it substantially more difficult to treat. For example, CRC is one of the more survivable diseases if caught early: it has an observed five-year survival rate of 92% in stage I, but only 11% in stage IV. We believe that early, non-invasive, accurate cancer diagnosis remains a significant unmet medical need and a huge commercial opportunity. For these reasons, cancer diagnostics is an active field of research and development both academically and commercially.

The global IVD market is forecast to reach $65 billion in 2018, driven by the increasing health care demands of an aging population. In the United States, the IVD market is made up of:

·
 Immunochemistry of tissue samples (expected to grow 6.8% per annum from 2011-2018, with an expected value of $25.5 billion by 2018). These are mostly used to confirm cancer diagnosis post-surgery and to determine cancer sub-type; 
 ·
 Immunoassay (chemical tests used to detect a substance in blood or body fluid), is expected to be the second largest market with a value of more than $19.1 billion by 2018. These tests are mostly used to monitor for disease progress and relapse. This market segment includes our future Nucleosomics® products, which will be blood-based immunoassay tests for modified nucleosomes for the diagnosis of cancer.

Testing is carried out at three principal locations:

·
 Testing at hospital laboratories: $30 billion annual revenue for 8 billion tests in 2011;
 ·
 Testing at CLIA laboratories: $20 billion annual revenue for 3 billion tests in 2011; and
 ·
 Testing at physician office laboratories: $3 billion annual revenue for 1.2 billion tests in 2011. 

Our Product Candidates 

Commercialization of our future products in the clinical IVD market (e.g. for patient diagnosis in hospitals, clinics, etc.), requires government approval (CE Marking in Europe, FDA approval in the United States and CFDA approval in China). We obtained our first biomarker CE Mark in September 2015 and received two further CE Marks in April 2016 for biomarkers for CRC and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, in December 2016 we achieved a CE Mark on our first product the Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test.

The technology behind the products that we are currently developing is described in detail below: 


Nu.QTM Suite of Epigenetic Cancer Blood Tests

 Using our Nucleosomics® technology, we have developed thirty-nine epigenetic Nu.QTM assays, which are designed to detect the level and structure of nucleosomes in blood. Epigenetics is the science of how genes are switched on or off in the bodys cells. A major factor controlling the switching on and off is the structuring of DNA. The DNA in human cells is packaged as protein complexes in a beads on a string structure. Each individual protein/DNA bead is called a nucleosome. These nucleosomes then form additional structures with increasingly dense packing, culminating in chromosomes containing hundreds of thousands of nucleosomes.

Figure 1  A nucleosome

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled and often rapid cell growth which exceeds the corresponding rate of cell death. When cells die, the DNA fragments into individual nucleosomes which are released into the blood as illustrated in Figure 2 below. The cell debris in the bloodstream is eventually recycled back into the body. When a cancer is present, the number of dying cells can overwhelm the recycling process, leaving the excess fragments, including the nucleosomes, in the blood. Importantly, the structure of nucleosomes is not uniform but subject to immense variety, and nucleosomes in cancer cells have differences in structure from those in healthy cells.

Figure 2  Release of nucleosomes into blood

Blood nucleosome levels can be raised in conditions other than cancer including in auto-immune disease, inflammatory disease, endometriosis, sepsis, and in the immediate aftermath of major trauma (for example following a heart attack, surgery or car accident). Our primary focus is on cancer diagnosis but we also intend to pursue diagnostic opportunities in other disease areas.

To date we have developed thirty-nine Nu.QTM blood assays that fall into the five main types set forth below and are intended to complement each other and, together, to provide a total solution. 

·
 Nu.QTM-X: We have developed two blood assays in the Nu.QTM-X family to detect nucleosomes containing specific nucleotides. 
 ·
 Nu.QTM-V: We have developed four blood assays in the Nu.QTM-V family to detect nucleosomes containing specific histone variants. Through our research, we have found that the pattern of blood levels of the different types of histone variants in nucleosomes is different for different cancer types. 
 ·
 Nu.QTM-M: We have developed eighteen blood assays in the Nu.QTM-M family to detect nucleosomes containing modified histones, the proteins that package and order DNA into nucleosomes. 
 ·
 Nu.QTM-A: We have developed fourteen blood assays in the Nu.QTM-A family to detect nucleosome-protein adducts. 
 ·
 Nu.QTM-T: We have developed one Nu.QTM-T assay to detect total blood nucleosome levels.

Generally, the assays described above are being developed to work in combination, collectively called a Nu.QTM panel, for the IVD market. In our biggest independent clinical trial to date, we have used Nu.QTM panel prototypes to test approximately 4800 samples from patients with symptoms associated with CRC. 

We are part way through a trial of 14,000 asymptomatic (screening) subjects. This cohort is split into 8,000 fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, positive subjects and 6,000 FIT negative subjects.

The Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test, which achieved the CE Mark in December 2016, is a single normalized assay blood test that is designed to be combined with a patients FIT score to reduce false positive referrals for non screen-relevant colonoscopies.

The most frequently used first line screening test for colorectal cancer across Europe is the FIT. Patients with a positive score following FIT are then referred for colonoscopy. However, more than 90% of people who test positive with FIT do not have colorectal cancer. This means there are a significant number of unnecessary expensive and invasive colonoscopies performed, placing a severe burden on both the patient and the healthcare system. For countries utilizing the Nu.Q test, patients with a positive FIT score would subsequently be given the blood-based Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test and then only be referred for colonoscopy if the combined test results indicate that it is necessary.

Results of our Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test developed using 1,907 FIT positive individuals (the training set), were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology in October 2016. The test demonstrated the potential to reduce the number of colonoscopies by up to 25% while maintaining almost 97% detection of colorectal cancer.

The test was validated in 1,961 distinct FIT positive individuals (the validation set) from the same average risk population achieving 28.6% reduction in colonoscopies with a sensitivity for CRC of 91.2%. These results were presented at the World Congress of GI Endoscopy in February of 2017.

Additionally, prototype Nu.QTM panels have been used to test a small number of blood samples from lung and prostate cancer patients.

Nu.QTM Clinical Diagnostic Products 

There are three basic platforms in the clinical IVD market that we intend to adapt our Nu.QTM products to in the future. 

·
 Centralized Laboratory Market: Centralized laboratories test thousands of patient blood samples taken every day, mostly using fully-automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, systems, commonly known as random access analyzers, usually supplied by one of the global diagnostics companies. Tests run on ELISA systems use components of the immune system and chemicals to detect antibody interactions with target analytes.

ELISA systems analyze thousands of blood samples every day and can run dozens of different ELISA tests in any combination on any sample and for many samples simultaneously. The systems are highly automated and rapid (as little as ten minutes for many tests), and can be run at low costs. Additionally, ELISA instruments are used in all major hospitals throughout the United States and Europe and therefore, are well understood by clinicians and laboratory staff. It is more cost-effective and technically simple for hospitals and clinics to run several blood samples simultaneously using ELISA tests compared to non-ELISA tests or alternative methods for screening cancer. All of the Nu.QTM tests that we are in the process of developing are designed for ELISA systems. A typical example of an automated ELISA system is shown below in Figure 4.

Figure 4  Example of an Automated ELISA System

One option that may be available to us in the future is to license our Nucleosomics® technology to a global diagnostics company. We do not have an anticipated timeframe for licensing our Nucleosomics® technology.

Another option that may be available to us is to sell 96 well ELISA plates for use by these laboratories for manual or semi-automated analysis using liquid handling systems. The Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test CE Mark allows this to be processed either manually or via an automated DS2 workstation from Dynex Technologies. 

·
 Point-of-Care Devices: Point-of-care devices are small instruments that perform tens of ELISA tests per day rapidly on blood taken from a finger prick. The instruments can be implemented in any oncology clinic and tests can be performed during patient consultations. We intend to contract with an instrument manufacturer to produce these instruments for point-of-care Nu.QTM testing for the oncologists office, general doctors office or at home testing. We aim to enter the point-of-care clinical market in Europe and the United States about 18 months after launch on the manual and semi-automated platforms, as we will first need to adapt test prototypes to these small instruments and demonstrate their success in the greater diagnostics market before these products will be adopted by others in the industry. At this stage of its development, we cannot accurately predict the costs to manufacture these devices or their selling price. We are in discussion with several potential partners regarding development and manufacture of these devices, however, there is no assurance that any of these discussions will result in an agreement. See Figure 5 for an example of a point-of-care device.

Figure 5  Example of a Point-of-Care Device

The above photograph is an illustration of our intended products. To date, we have one product available for sale on the IVD market and there is no guarantee that any other products will be developed or commercialized on such market.

·
 Disposable Tests for Doctors Office or Home Use: Disposable tests for use in a doctors office or at home are single shot disposable devices which can be provided by a clinician as part of a screening program or purchased over the counter at any chemist shop or pharmacy and test a drop of blood taken from a finger prick. The test can be administered at a doctors office using a point-of-care device or performed at home using a home testing kit, neither of which requires laboratory involvement. Thus, the patient experiences considerably lower costs using these tests as compared to traditional laboratory tests. The format of the self-use home testing kit is very easy to use and reproduce and does not rely on laboratory processing. There are currently no useful diagnostics tests suitable for mass screening for cancer in general through a simple self-use home testing kit. Figure 6 below shows a basic home use test on the left which displays the results of the test in the two windows, similar to a pregnancy test. The test on the right is more sophisticated and plugs into a meter or the USB port of a computer for analysis and interpretation allowing results to be sent directly to a clinician.
Figure 6  Examples of Disposable Tests for Doctors Office or Home Use

The above photograph is an illustration of our intended products. To date, we have one product available for sale on the IVD market and there is no guarantee that any other such products will be developed or commercialized on such market.

We intend to contract with a specialist company to adapt the Nu.QTM test prototypes to the doctors office or home use system and to contract with a manufacturer for the production of these tests beginning approximately 18 months after launch on the manual platform. We have not entered into any agreements or contracts with a specialist company or manufacturer. Initially, we intend to sell these tests for professional use only (doctors office) and to sell the tests for non-professional home use at a later time. We do not yet have an estimated timeframe for entering into this market. Further, at this early stage of our development, we cannot accurately determine the manufacturing costs or selling price of these tests.

Nu.QTM tests for non-cancer conditions 

Blood nucleosome levels can be raised in conditions other than cancer including in auto-immune disease, inflammatory disease, endometriosis, sepsis, and in the immediate aftermath of major trauma (for example following a heart attack, surgery or car accident). Our primary focus is on cancer diagnosis but we also intend to pursue diagnostic opportunities in other disease areas. Our primary non-cancer focus is the development of a test for endometriosis. 

Endometriosis is a progressive gynecological condition that affects one in ten women of childbearing age and approximately 176 million women worldwide. The disease is the leading cause of infertility in women, with up to 40% of all infertile women suffering from endometriosis. At present, there is currently no existing non-surgical diagnostic test for endometriosis. Diagnosis is typically made via invasive and expensive laparoscopy, followed by a histological examination of any lesions found to confirm the diagnosis. The lack of a suitable screening test has also held up development of a cure for the disease.

Singapore Volition acquired the patent application for an endometriosis test in June 2011 and we are now in the process of developing the test based on our existing Nucleosomics® technology. We designed the test to be a simple blood test taken at two stages of a womans menstrual cycle, during menses and partway through the month. If the two measurements show quantitative differences in total nucleosome level, endometriosis is indicated. We are currently conducting hypothesis-testing and clinical proof of concept work (to demonstrate that the test is feasible and is effective) on the endometriosis test in our laboratory. We completed pilot studies of the test in 2012. The University of Oxford will provide serum and plasma samples from approximately 350 individuals including 150 with endometriosis, 130 with symptoms but no endometriosis and 70 with no symptoms as controls collected over a period of two years. Approximately half the samples were provided in 2016 with the remaining samples to be provided in 2017. Further samples from a prospective serial collection in 20 healthy women and 20 women with confirmed endometriosis were provided by Clinical Trials Laboratory Services (UK) in the first half of 2016. The test is too early in its development for us to accurately determinate the manufacturing costs and sale price of the test. In the short term the Company has decided to stay additional research and development in this area while it focuses on its cancer diagnostic products.

HyperGenomics®

We are in the process of developing HyperGenomics® tissue and blood-based tests to determine disease subtype following initial diagnosis and to help decide the most appropriate therapy. In 2015, we decided to focus on our clinical IVD Nucleosomics® products and only continue with background work in HyperGenomics® until we have the capital and management resources to do multiple programs concurrently.

Selecting the correct treatment approach can significantly improve outcome, reduce side effects and deliver cost savings. The HyperGenomics® tests will be performed on cancer tissue obtained either by biopsy or during surgical resection to determine the cancer subtype and to determine optimal treatment regimens. The HyperGenomics® profiling tests are being developed to provide detailed epigenetic characterization of tumors in a cost effective way. A new protocol for analyzing white blood cells  a precursor to applications in leukemia - was developed in 2012. We commenced development of a bioinformatics pipeline to analyze the complex data sets generated from the biological samples in 2012 and continued development of the algorithms in 2013. A new in-house methodology patent for HyperGenomics® was filed in 2015.

We plan to allocate resources to the HyperGenomics® research use only, or RUO, kit as soon as is practical (likely in 2018) given our focus on the Nucleosomics® clinical IVD products. Beta-testing is expected to take approximately six months to complete once initiated and we expect it to cost approximately $50,000. If beta-testing is successful, we expect to launch HyperGenomics® research kits into the RUO market in Europe and in the United States. 

Further exemplification work on the HyperGenomics® platform is being carried out through a PhD studentship at the German Cancer Centre in Heidelberg funded by Volition. The program includes development of HyperGenomic® profiles in a range of cells and cancer models and comparison to established industry standard analytical techniques.

We plan to launch the HyperGenomics® test into the IVD market in Europe and the United States following the commercialization of the test into the RUO market. The estimated timeframe for its launch into the IVD market has not yet been determined and will depend upon the speed of clinical trials and market approval. The HyperGenomics® test is too early in its development for us to accurately determinate the manufacturing costs and sale price of the test. 

Clinical Studies

We have completed two clinical studies in CRC, one study in pancreatic cancer, one study in prostate cancer and one study in lung cancer with the results announced as set forth below. 
Completed Colorectal Cancer Studies

·
 Results of a completed clinical study in CRC were announced in the fourth quarter of 2015. The study included 121 patients referred for colonoscopy at the university hospital, CHU Dinant Godinne - UCL Namur, in Belgium, who either presented with symptoms suggesting the presence of CRC or were high-risk subjects. Analysis of the results revealed that a panel test of four Nu.QTM biomarker assays, adjusted for age, detected 91% of CRC cases at 90% specificity. In addition, the results showed equally accurate detection of early and late-stage cancers. The analysis also revealed that the same panel test detected 67% of the type of polyps most likely to develop into cancer.

·
 Results of a completed blinded retrospective clinical study in colorectal adenomas and CRC in collaboration with Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark were announced in the first quarter of 2016. The primary objective of the study was to identify new nucleosome biomarkers to improve precancerous polyp/adenoma detection. A secondary objective was to identify new nucleosome biomarkers to improve early stage CRC detection. In the study approximately 430 samples from patients with single or multiple precancerous polyp(s) (181 patients), subjects with no polyps or CRCs and without other diseases (160 subjects); plus 88 early stage (I/II) CRC patients were investigated. The cohort comprised high and low risk polyps of various histologies. The samples were analyzed using 18 Nu.QTM assays. Use of newly developed Nu.QTM assays, as part of a panel of five of the Companys Nu.QTM biomarker blood assays, accurately detected 75% of colorectal adenomas, or polyps, that were most likely to become cancerous in an age adjusted analysis. A Nu.QTM panel also detected 86% of early stage I CRCs in an age adjusted analysis. 
 
9

Completed Pancreatic Cancer Study

·
 Results of a completed clinical study in pancreatic cancer were announced in the third quarter of 2015. The peer-reviewed study was conducted in collaboration with Lund University, Sweden, and led by Roland Andersson, MD, PhD, Professor of Surgery and Vice-Dean, Faculty of Medicine. This study assessed blood samples from 59 individuals, including 25 patients with stage 2 pancreatic cancer, 10 patients with other pancreatic diseases and 24 healthy individuals, using our Nucleosomics® technology platform. Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated that a panel of five Nu.QTM assays distinguished 84% (21 of 25) of the early-stage pancreatic cancer cases from healthy subjects, with only two false positive results among the healthy subjects. The detection rate of the test was improved further to 92% (23 of 25) of cancer cases by inclusion of the classical CA19-9 cancer biomarker with no false positives results among the healthy subjects. Full results of the study have been published in Clinical Epigenetics, the official journal of the Clinical Epigenetics Society.
Completed Prostate Cancer Study

·
 Results of a completed retrospective study in prostate cancer were announced in the second quarter of 2016. The study was conducted with Surrey Cancer Research Institute, University of Surrey, UK with 550 blood samples collected from patients attending the hospital and analyzed using a panel of Nu.QTM biomarker assays. Three groups of patients were assessed: those with aggressive prostate cancer; those with indolent or slow-growing prostate cancer; and age-matched healthy controls. Analysis of the study showed that a single Nu.QTM biomarker assay detected 71% of early state I prostate cancer cases at 93% specificity.

Completed Lung Cancer Study

·
 Results of a completed clinical study in lung cancer were announced in the fourth quarter of 2014. The lung cancer study tested both sputum and blood samples taken from 46 patients attending the Pneumology department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, or CHU, de Liege in Belgium. The patients were diagnosed either with non-small cell lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, or with no disease (healthy). In sputum samples, our Nu.QTM test was able to detect 18 of 21 lung cancer cases (85%) with no false positive results for healthy subjects (0 of 13). The sputum assay data is age and smoking independent. In blood the Nu.QTM assays were able to detect 16 of the 21 patients with cancer (76%) with a single false positive result from a healthy subject (1 of 13). The blood assay data is adjusted for age and smoking risk. 

We currently have clinical studies underway in CRC, lung cancer, pancreatic and prostate cancer as well as a pan-cancer study in 27 cancers as set forth below. Further studies in lung and pancreatic cancer are planned to commence in 2017.

Current Colorectal Cancer Studies

·
 A retrospective symptomatic CRC study with Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark with full access to all Danish national registries and databases analyzing approximately 4,800 previously collected samples from patients with CRC, polyps or adenomas, benign bowel diseases, other malignancies, or no findings, all of whom have undergone a colonoscopy, which we refer to as the Retrospective CRC Trial. The Retrospective CRC Trial is designed to (i) establish a Nu.QTM profile for the detection of CRC in an initially blinded cohort, which we refer to as Phase I; and (ii) validate that profile in a second blind cohort, which we refer to as Phase II. As part of Phase I, at the end of the third quarter 2015, we announced detection of 81% of CRC cases at 78% specificity in an age adjusted analysis. Additional Nu.QTM assays are currently being tested on these Phase I samples. Phase II commenced using the best Nu.QTM assays on the blind sample cohort in 2015 and was paused in 2016 to focus on the Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test. The results from this study were also used to support CE Marking of specific Nu.QTM assays in the second half of 2016.

·
 A prospective FIT screening CRC study with Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark which will include approximately 14,000 blood samples collected from subjects who have taken a FIT test. Approximately 6,000 (of the 14,000) samples will be collected from subjects who tested negative in FIT and approximately 8,000 (of the 14,000) samples from patients who tested positive. All subjects testing positive will be offered a colonoscopy. The Prospective CRC Study is designed for the development of a CRC screening test in a large screening cohort and includes full access to all FIT and colonoscopy results as well as subjects medical history. FIT positive and negative samples will be analyzed in batches throughout the collection period to develop Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Tests for European markets.

In addition, the FIT positive samples have been used to develop a Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test which, when combined with FIT, has the potential to offer up to a 25% reduction in colonoscopies while maintaining almost 97% detection of CRC.

·
 A prospective clinical study of 30,000 patients conducted with Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Under the terms of the study, an initial 30,000 blood samples will be collected from 30,000 patients who have tested negative in a national fecal CRC screening test. We also have an option to collect a further 60,000 blood samples (two blood samples from each of the same 30,000 subjects at two year intervals), commencing in late 2018. We will test whether, and how early, our Nu.QTM assays detect cancer in blood samples taken before the definitive diagnosis of CRC. All blood samples will be accompanied by up to 120 clinical information data points, including life style factors and a wide range of other diseases, allowing us to use this study in a wider context for other cancers.

Current Lung Cancer Studies

·
 A prospective lung cancer study conducted with the Liege University Hospital (Belgium) with 240 subjects collected from subjects with lung cancer, COPD and with healthy lungs. The trial is designed to evaluate the potential of a Nu.QTM based test alone and with additional patient data, to detect the most common non-small cell lung cancer. Preliminary results from the first 73 subjects released in the fourth quarter of 2015 demonstrated that, when combined with details of smoking history, a panel of four Nu.QTM biomarker assays detected 93% of non-small cell lung cancer cases (27 of 29), with 91% specificity (2 false positive results among 22 healthy subjects). Collection and full analysis is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2017. Additional preliminary results from the first 87 subjects were released in the first quarter of 2016 demonstrating that a single Nu.QTM biomarker assay detected 86% of subjects with a deadly lung disease called Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

Current Pancreatic Cancer Studies

·
 A 750 patient study is being conducted with DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Center, to evaluate our Nu.QTM blood tests for the detection of pancreatic cancer. This study was put on hold in 2016 to focus on the Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test and we expect to reinitiate it in the second half of 2017.

Current Prostate Cancer Studies

·
 A retrospective study to evaluate Nu.QTM assays in a treatment selection setting to distinguish anaplastic cancer, a particularly aggressive form of prostate cancer, from typical castration resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC, the less aggressive form. This study is in progress and no results have been announced to date.

·
 A prospective prostate cancer study, carried out by Immune Health, with 120 patients with aggressive prostate cancer; those with indolent or slow-growing prostate cancer; and age-matched healthy controls. The study is currently in the recruiting phase and the analysis of the panel of Nu.QTM assay data is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2017. The study will also assess the ability to distinguish clinically actionable, aggressive prostate cancer from non-actionable slow growing disease. This study is in collection and no results have been announced to date.

Current Pan-Cancer Study

·
 A large prospective study conducted with University Hospital in Bonn, Germany on approximately 4,700 patients to evaluate the performance of our Nu.QTM assays on patients with the 27 most prevalent cancer types and other diseases, as well as healthy subjects. Collection of blood samples has commenced. Analysis of the blood samples will be performed with a wide range of Nu.QTM assays. The primary objectives of this study are: (i) to identify further cancers that are highly amenable to detection by Nu.QTM assays; and (ii) to identify Nu.QTM assays suitable for the differential diagnosis between cancers. The study has been paused due to the focusing of our efforts on other studies and it is expected to resume in 2017.
Research and Development Expenditures

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our expenditures for research and development activities were $6.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively. Such research and development is focused on responding to the need for early, accurate diagnostic tests through the development of our proprietary technologies and product prototypes.

Future Intellectual Property Strategy

We intend to continue our development of the Nucleosomics® and HyperGenomics® technologies and will continue to apply for patents for future product developments. Our strategy is to protect the technologies and gain market exclusivity with patents in Europe and the U.S. and in other strategic countries. The patents on the technologies underlying our products should provide broad coverage for each product, including protection through at least 2031 for products developed using the Nu.QTM-X, Nu.QTM-V and Nu.QTM-A technologies.

Trademarks 

We also own a number of trademarks that protect our marks including NuQ®, Nu.QTM, Nucleosomics® and HyperGenomics®. 

Government Regulations 

The health care industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. 

Both United States federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the health care industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As indicated by work plans and reports issued by these agencies, the federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of diagnostic health care products. Our diagnostic products fall within the IVD medical device category and are subject to FDA clearance or approval in the United States. 

The federal government also has increased funding in recent years to fight health care fraud, and various agencies, such as the United States Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, and state Medicaid fraud control units, are coordinating their enforcement efforts.

In Europe, medical devices are regulated by self-certification through the CE Mark system. Under the system, developers and manufacturers must operate a Quality System and validate medical devices in a limited clinical trial to demonstrate the manufacturer has met analytical and clinical performance criteria. We have implemented an International Organization for Standardization standard - ISO 13485 - quality management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices. ISO 13485 addresses managerial awareness of regulatory requirements, control systems, inspection and traceability, device design, risk and performance criteria as well as verification for corrective and preventative measures for device failure. Medical device companies such as ours are subject to pre-market compliance assessments from Notified Bodies, a certification organization which the national authority (the competent authority) of a European Union member state designates to carry out one or more of the conformity assessment procedures. ISO 13485 certification establishes conformity to specific European Union directives related to medical devices and allows CE Marking and sale of the device. The European Union has recently proposed terms that would impose additional requirements to obtain a CE Mark, which could result in delays and further expense, in terms of staff costs, to us as compared to the current CE Mark approval process, as the new regulations will require each product submission to be thoroughly audited by Notified Bodies, instead of the current self-certification process. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, or MDR, and IVD Regulation, or IVDR, are both in the final stages of the legislative procedure and are estimated to be furnished sometime in early 2017. The MDR and IVDR are expected to come into effect in 2020 and 2022, respectively. 

We will also be required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, industrial safety, and labor laws. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future, and lack of compliance could have material adverse effects on our operations. 

We believe that we have structured our business operations to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise.

Please refer to the section below titled Government Approval for additional information.

Government Approval 

All of our intended products are designed to be non-invasive, meaning they cannot harm the subject other than through misdiagnosis. Our strategy is to go through the process of obtaining regulatory approval for IVD products to be used clinically on cancer patients. Conformité Européenne, or CE Marking, is a mandatory conformity mark for certain products placed on the market in the European Union, including medical devices and IVD tests. CE Marking ensures that the manufacturers product conforms to the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation. We intend to first focus on obtaining regulatory approval in Europe, due to the grant of the Nu.QTM patent in Europe and the relatively fast European CE Marking process. We currently anticipate this will be followed closely by licensing to CLIA labs for a LDT in the United States, and/or regulatory submissions in the United States and in the rest of the world. In many territories, the European CE Mark is sufficient to place products on the clinical market and, where it is not, it often simplifies the regulation processes.
Europe  CE Marking 

Manufacturers in the European Union and abroad must meet CE Marking requirements, where applicable, in order to market their products in Europe. The CE Mark certifies that a product has met European Union health, safety, and environmental requirements which ensure consumer safety. 

To receive the CE Mark, our diagnostic products must meet certain requirements as set forth in the In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive. The requirements to procure CE Marking for IVD medical device products are: 

·
 analytical validation of the products;
 ·
 clinical validation of the products (which can be retrospective clinical studies using biobank patient samples, i.e. blood samples from historic patients);
 ·
 implementation of regulatory compliant manufacture; 
 ·
 implementation of a Quality System; and 
 ·
 certification from the International Organization for Standardization (this last requirement is not technically required but will aid the regulatory approval process in Europe and the United States).

The first Nu.QTM-X assay received a CE Mark in September 2015 and our R&D, manufacturing and distribution facility, Belgian Volition received EN ISO 13485, 2012 certification (an internationally recognized quality system) at the start of 2016. In April 2016 we received a CE Mark for Nu.QTM-V (variant) and Nu.QTM-T (total) assays Nu.QTM-V001 and Nu.QTM-T003, respectively. Additionally, in December 2016 we received a CE Mark on our Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test. The requirements listed above are general requirements that apply to all of our intended products. In compliance with the In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive and the CE Marking process, we have ensured that all development and validation is carried out in a manner consistent with regulatory approval. Additionally, we have maintained proper records so that our future products can be approved as quickly and simply as possible. We have engaged a regulatory advisor to lead the Company in meeting the last requirement for all of our future products. All of these requirements must be completed prior to the submission of an application for CE Marking. We will submit applications, which will contain a dossier of all relevant analytical, clinical and manufacturing data following retrospective clinical studies which we expect will require a total of approximately six (6) months to complete. We estimate the cost of obtaining CE Marking will be approximately $500,000 per Nu.QTM panel. Sales of our clinical products can occur in Europe once CE Marking has been granted.

In Europe, IVD companies currently are able to self-certify that they meet the appropriate regulatory requirements and are subject to inspection for enforcement. European agencies conduct market surveillance to ensure the provisions of the applicable Directive have been met for products marketed within the European Union. In pursuit of this goal, surveillance authorities will:

·
 audit commercial, industrial and storage premises;
 ·
 visit work places and other premises where products are put into service and used;
 ·
 organize random checks; and
 ·
 take samples of products for examination and testing.

If a product is found to be noncompliant, corrective action will depend on and be appropriate to the level of noncompliance. Those responsible for noncompliance of the product will also be held accountable. Penalties, which may include imprisonment, are determined by national law.

U.S. Regulations 

Food and Drug Administration 

In the United States, IVD products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. There are two principal regulatory pathways to receive authorization to market IVDs, a 510(k) or PMA. The FDA makes a risk-based determination as to which pathway a particular IVD is eligible. In addition, since July 2012 with the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, a de novo pathway is directly available for certain low to moderate risk devices that would not qualify for the 510(k) notification pathway due to lack of a predicate device. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of their level of risk and the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls, including establishment registration, device listing, labeling, reporting and recordkeeping, and adherence to FDAs quality system regulations, which are device-specific good manufacturing practices. Class II devices are subject to the general controls and also special controls, including guidance documents, performance standards, and postmarket surveillance. Class III devices are subject to most of the previously identified requirements as well as to a PMA. Most Class I devices are exempt from the requirement for 510(k) to the FDA; most Class II devices require the submission and clearance of a 510(k) to the FDA prior to commercial marketing; and Class III devices require submission and a PMA. Device manufacturers and PMA holders are also subject to numerous postmarketing requirements. 

The FDA can require the submission of clinical data to support 510(k) clearance, de novo reclassification, or a PMA. Clinical studies undertaken in the United States are subject to FDA requirements applicable to investigational device exemptions, or IDEs, institutional review boards, or IRBs, review and approval, and informed consent of the study subjects. 
 
15

Clinical Trials of Devices 

Clinical trials for a medical device must be conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, including informed consent from study participants, review and approval by an IRB at each institution where a trial will be conducted, financial disclosure by clinical investigators, and listing of appropriate studies on ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, FDA approval of an IDE application must be obtained in order to conduct a clinical trial of significant risk devices, which are devices that present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject, including devices that are of substantial importance in diagnosing or treating disease, or preventing impairment of human health. Sponsors of clinical trials are responsible for monitoring the studies, and for recordkeeping and reporting. The FDA may prevent clinical trials from moving forward, and may suspend or terminate trials once initiated. The FDA may inspect sponsor records, clinical investigators, and clinical sites involved in clinical trials. The FDA may take enforcement action for non-compliance with any of these requirements. 
510(k) Premarket Notification 

A 510(k) notification requires the sponsor to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to another marketed device, termed a predicate device, that is legally marketed in the United States and for which a PMA was not required. A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and same technological characteristics as the predicate or has the same intended use but different technological characteristics, where the information submitted to the FDA does not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness and demonstrates that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed predicate device. 

The FDAs performance goal review time for a 510(k) notification is 90 days from the date of receipt. In practice, however, the review process often takes significantly longer. After its initial review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, in order to make a decision regarding the claims of substantial equivalence. Clinical studies of IVD products are typically designed with the primary objective of obtaining analytical or clinical performance data. If the FDA believes that the device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter and designate the device as a Class III device, which will require the submission and approval of a PMA before the new device may be marketed. Under certain circumstances, the sponsor may submit a de novo petition to the FDA to reclassify the new device as a Class I or Class II device. 

If a predicate device does not exist, the FDA may make a risk-based determination that the device is eligible for de novo reclassification and premarket review instead of requiring a PMA. The de novo process is similar to clearance of the 510(k), and typically requires the submission of clinical data to support the reclassification. A de novo petition can be submitted either prior to the submission of a 510(k) when no predicate device can be identified, or after the FDA determines that a new device is not substantially equivalent due to lack of an appropriate predicate device. Under the FDASIA, the FDA may decline to undertake a classification if the FDA either (1) identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k), or (2) determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. The statute directs the FDA to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. 

Premarket Approval 

The PMA process is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by manufacturing data, preclinical data, and more detailed and comprehensive scientific evidence, including clinical data, to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medical device for its intended purpose. If the device is determined to present a significant risk, the sponsor may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the FDA and obtains approval from the FDA to begin the trial. 

After the PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to make a threshold determination that the PMA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the PMA is deemed not sufficiently complete, the FDA will issue a refuse to file determination. If the PMA is complete, the FDA will file the PMA and begin a substantive review of the application. The FDA is subject to a performance goal review time for a PMA that is 180 days from the date of filing, although in practice the total review time is longer. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data, additional testing and submissions by the applicant, and referral to an advisory committee may delay the process considerably. Indeed, the total process may take several years and there is no guarantee that the PMA will ever be approved. Even if approved, the FDA may limit the indication for which the device may be marketed. The FDA may also request additional clinical studies or registries as a condition of approval or even after the PMA is approved. Any changes to the medical device may require a supplemental PMA to be submitted and approved. In addition, annual reports and other reports are required.

Requirements Applicable to Marketed Devices 

The FDA Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, impose requirements for design control and validation, management review, complaint handling and investigation, labeling control, servicing and recordkeeping, among others. The FDA also regulates device imports and exports. Manufacturers are required to submit medical device reports for deaths or serious injuries associated with the use of their devices, and for malfunctions that could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The FDA also requires reporting of certain corrections or removals of devices. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to regulation by the FDA, and certain device advertising is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission. 
Laboratory Developed Tests 

Although the FDA has claimed for many years that it has the statutory authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, as medical devices, the agency has generally exercised enforcement discretion toward them. LDTs are tests that are developed, validated, and offered as testing services by a clinical laboratory, and these tests are regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, or CLIA. The FDA has stated that it will take enforcement action against any specific LDT if necessary to protect the public health. In recent years, the FDA has indicated that it is reconsidering its policy of enforcement discretion and reviewing the regulatory requirements that it will apply to LDTs.
CLIA and State Clinical Laboratory Laws 

The FDA is responsible for the complexity categorization of commercially marketed IVD tests under CLIA, placing them into one of three categories based upon the potential risk to public health in reporting erroneous results. The categories were devised on the basis of the complexity of the test, and include waived tests, tests of moderate complexity, and tests of high complexity. 

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, regulates clinical laboratories under CLIA. Laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease or assessment of health are subject to CLIA, which imposes quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. 

Laboratories performing moderate- or high-complexity testing must meet various CLIA requirements applicable to personnel, operations, establishment and verification of performance specifications, proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, and quality assurance. CLIA certified laboratories are typically subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. Sanctions can be applied against a laboratory that is found to be out of compliance with CLIA requirements, including, among others, suspension, limitation, or revocation of a CLIA certificate. 

Laboratories may also seek accreditation by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP. CAP is an independent, non-governmental organization approved by CMS to inspect laboratories to determine compliance with CLIA requirements. The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program is an internationally recognized program that utilizes teams of practicing laboratory professionals as inspectors, and accreditation by CAP can often be used to meet CLIA or state certification requirements. 

In addition to CLIA, States also have laws that apply to clinical laboratories, including state licensing laws. Some states impose requirements that are more stringent than CLIA requirements. State laws may also require detailed review of a laboratorys technical procedures or scientific validation of laboratory tests.

Product Development and Plan of Operations 

Nu.QTM Assays (Cancer and Other Conditions): 

·
 In-Vitro Diagnostics Market

o
 CE Marking (Europe): The first Nu.QTM-X biomarker assay received a CE Mark in September 2015. In April 2016 we received a CE Mark for Nu.QTM-V (variant) and Nu.QTM-T (total) assays Nu.QTM-V001 and Nu.QTM-T003, respectively. Additionally, in December 2016 we received a CE Mark on Nu.QTM Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test. 

o
 FDA Approval (United States): FDA approval for CRC screening applications is expected to require longer large-scale prospective clinical validation studies including U.S. trials. Our FDA PMA clinical trial process is expected to commence in 2017 and be completed in 2019. When the trial is completed, the data will be submitted to the FDA for United States PMA. We estimate the cost of obtaining FDA PMA will be approximately $5 million, with the understanding that up to $50 million may ultimately be required depending on a multitude of factors as previously discussed. As an intermediate step we will seek 510(k) approval for use of Nu.QTM as a symptomatic adjunct test (used in combination with other tests to identify at risk patients). This abbreviated process is expected to begin in 2017 and complete in 2018 with an estimated cost of between $1.5 million and $2 million.

We expect to produce a rolling pipeline of products for different types of cancers over the next one to five years. 

Nu.QTM Clinical Diagnostic Products:
·
 Centralized Laboratory Market

o
 License of Nucleosomics® technology to a global diagnostics company: We may license our Nucleosomics® technology on a non-exclusive basis to a global diagnostics company. The approximate licensing fees have not yet been determined. We have not entered into any agreements with diagnostic companies or established an anticipated timeframe for licensing our Nucleosomics® technology.

o
 Sell manual and/or semi-manual ELISA plates to centralized laboratories: We may sell manual and/or semi-automated 96 well ELISA plates for use by centralized laboratories. The approximate manufacturing costs or sales price have not yet been determined. We are in discussions with several groups to distribute our products in multiple regions.

o
 Point-of-Care Devices: We intend to enter the point-of-care clinical market in Europe and in the United States 18 months after launching on the manual platform. The approximate manufacturing costs or sales price per device have not yet been determined. We have not entered into any discussions or negotiations regarding the manufacture or sale of these devices.

o
 Disposable Tests for Doctors Office or Home Use: We intend to contract with a specialist company to adapt the Nu.QTM tests to the doctors office or home use system and to contract with a manufacturer for the production of these tests. The sale of these tests will initially be for professional use only (doctors) and will likely be released at a later time for non-professional home use. The approximate manufacturing costs or sales price per test have not yet been determined. We have not entered into any discussions or negotiations with a specialist company or manufacturer. We do not yet have an estimated timeframe for the manufacture or sale of these tests.

If we do not have enough funds to fully implement our business plan, we will be forced to scale back our plan of operations and our business activities, increase our anticipated timeframes to complete each milestone or seek additional funding. In the event that additional financing is delayed, we will prioritize the maintenance of its research and development personnel and facilities, primarily in Belgium, and the maintenance of our patent rights. In the event of an ongoing lack of financing, we may be obliged to discontinue operations.

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

Our future products will require several dynamic and evolving sales models tailored to different worldwide markets, users and products. In 2017, we intend to launch our own products to be used in combination with existing technologies, such as the FIT, to progressively grow sales volumes after CE Marking in Europe with sales to centralized governments and laboratories. We also intend to sell to the private payer market in some Asian countries.
Competition 

We believe that our main competitor in the blood-based diagnostic market is Epigenomics AG. Epigenomics has European approval for its methylated DNA based PCR tests in colon cancer (Epi proColon®) and lung cancer (Epi proLung). In colon cancer, our main target market, we face potential competition from alternative procedures including flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy as well as traditional tests such as the guaiac and immunochemical FIT. Exact Sciences Corporation has FDA approval and reimbursement approval for its stool-based DNA screening test, Cologuard®. We anticipate facing competition primarily from healthcare, pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies such as Epigenomics AG, Applied Proteomics Inc., and Exact Sciences Corporation, as well as others such as Abbott Laboratories Inc., Cepheid Inc., Philips, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Gen-Probe Incorporated, MDxHealth SA, and Roche Diagnostics. There may also be other companies developing products competitive with ours of which we are unaware.

We hope that our future products will have a competitive edge compared to those offered by competitors on the basis that our tests are being developed to be accurate, cost-effective and attractive from a government reimbursement perspective, easy to use, non-invasive, technologically advanced, and compatible with ELISA systems, based on strong intellectual property and to be used for mass screenings.

Many of our anticipated competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and distribution systems than we have. Many of our competitors also offer broad product lines outside of the diagnostic testing market and have brand recognition. Moreover, our competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our intended technologies and products becoming obsolete before we are able to enter the market, recover the expenses incurred to develop them or generate significant revenue. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop our intended products in a timely manner, keep our future products current with advancing technologies, achieve market acceptance of our future products, gain name recognition and a positive reputation in the healthcare industry, and establish successful marketing, sales and distribution efforts.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we (including our subsidiaries) had 18 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees.
