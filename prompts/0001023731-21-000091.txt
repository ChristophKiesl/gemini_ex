ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
8x8 is transforming the future of business communications as a leading Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") provider of voice, video, contact center, and communication APIs powered by a global cloud communications platform. 8x8 empowers workforces worldwide by connecting individuals and teams so they can collaborate faster and work smarter from anywhere. 8x8 provides real-time business analytics and intelligence giving its customers unique insights across all interactions and channels on our platform so they can support a distributed and hybrid working model while delighting their end-customers and accelerating their business. 8x8 has approximately 1.8 million paid business users. 
Until recently, the unified communications market had been one of the last to move to the cloud. This past year's rapid acceleration of digital transformation has boards and executive leadership teams increasingly looking towards secure cloud communications as a core element of business resilience. Through seamless, personalized engagement, these organizations are able to drive differentiated customer experiences. We believe the ability for employees to communicate productively from either a single, easy-to-use application or directly within their existing business applications is quickly becoming a fundamental differentiator in digital transformation.
The 8x8 open communications platform is a highly available, fully redundant solution, supported by a single, standard and financially-backed Service Level Agreement across unified communications as a service ("UCaaS") and contact center as a service ("CCaaS"). It is one of the industry’s most complete cloud technology stack and operates in a SaaS business model. A consistent data layer across the platform powers 8x8 AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning) algorithms to deliver data-driven business insights and intelligent, comprehensive, and integrated applications that drive employee productivity, resource optimization, and more effective end customer interactions. Our cloud communications, contact center, and collaboration solutions are designed for easy deployment, management, and use, operating across multiple devices and locations for any business workflow or global environment. Built from core cloud technologies that we own and manage internally, our platform solution enables 8x8 customers to rely on one provider for their global communications, video meetings, contact center and customer support requirements.
The 8x8 Platform Strategy
We offer a highly scalable and configurable cloud communications platform comprising voice, video meetings, chat and team collaboration, contact center, communication APIs, and analytics for businesses of all sizes across the globe. Customers can start out with an individual service or combination of services, for example, with video conferencing or phone service, and then scale their usage over time by enabling additional services, capabilities and analytics offerings when ready. The key attributes of the 8x8 solution include:
•Unified Communications, Collaboration, and Contact Center on a single, API-based Cloud Technology Platform. We believe that a common platform for communication and collaboration drives more efficient employee and customer engagement and greater business productivity. Unlike many of our principal competitors, we own the core technology and manage the platform behind all of our services: voice, video meetings, contact center, chat and team collaboration, and communications APIs. We believe having control over our entire platform enables us to deliver a more consistent and seamless experience for our customers across all aspects of the service from the user interface to the technical support experience.
•Big Data, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence. We have developed a suite of web-based analytics tools to help customers make informed decisions based on underlying communications data associated with 8x8 services and supported devices. We continue to make strategic investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to develop new capabilities and features for our customers such as context-rich customer engagements, intelligent call routing and faster first-call resolution.
•Global Reach®. 8x8's Global Reach® technology provides enterprise-grade quality of service, reliability, security and support for our multinational customers. Our platform utilizes intelligent geo-routing technology and leverages data centers across globally dispersed regions - North America, South America, Continental Europe, Asia, and Australia - to provide consistently high call quality to customers worldwide.
•Intuitive User Experience. Our web, desktop, and mobile interfaces act as the communications portal for all 8x8 services and provide customers with a familiar, consistent and integrated user experience across all endpoints.
•Committed Service Quality and Availability over the Public Internet. We offer a single, standard Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) for our enterprise customers across our contact center and business communications services. This SLA includes meaningful uptime and voice quality commitments, backed by service credits and a no-penalty early termination right for the customer under specified conditions.

•Configurability and Flexibility. Each service plan in our flagship offering, X Series, is designed for the different roles in a company so customers only pay for the features each role needs. No matter what the business communication or contact center needs are now, X Series has a service plan designed to meet them, while giving customers an easy way to expand and upgrade their communications options in the future. The simplicity and ease of configuration and deployment is due to all solutions being owned by 8x8 and sharing the same platform.
•Rapid Deployment. Business agility in the global, modern economy is a competitive necessity, and we embrace the notion that communication services should be deployable as quickly as possible, including across highly distributed businesses with multiple facilities or remote workforces. Our services can generally be provisioned in minutes from web-based administrative tools, and we continue to increase the automation across our deployment, billing, and support systems to provide greater speed and flexibility for our customers. To ensure consistency and quality across our services and customer base, we have developed a standard, yet flexible, deployment methodology. We apply this systematic approach to all of our deployments, regardless of size or complexity.
•Integration with Third-Party Business Applications. Our software uses a combination of open APIs and pre-built integrations to retrieve contextually relevant data from, and to enhance the functionality of, a wide variety of customers' third-party applications, including Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Google, NetSuite, Okta, Zendesk, Oracle Sales Cloud, Bullhorn, Aryaka, and Hubspot.
•Emphasis on Security and Compliance. Our security program is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our customers data. We believe we have created a top-down culture of security and compliance, including a commitment to secure architecture and development. As such, we have made significant investments in achieving compliance with various industry standards for data security and related third-party certifications.
•Jitsi Open Source Video Project. 8x8 is the sponsor and primary contributor to the Jitsi secure video conferencing open source project. We operate jitsi.org and the Jitsi Meet service, and develop our Video Meetings portfolio based on this code. 8x8 offers the Jitsi community an intuitive upgrade path to rich, supported communications applications.
Our Solutions Through our integrated technology platform, we offer our customers a portfolio of voice, video, contact center, chat and team collaboration, communication APIs and business analytics solutions which include:
•8x8 Work: a self-contained, feature-rich, end-to-end United Communications solution that delivers enterprise voice with PSTN connectivity, secure video meetings and unified messaging powered by one global cloud communications platform.
•8x8 Contact Center: a multi-channel cloud-based contact center solution that enables both large and small contact centers to enjoy the same customer experience and agent productivity benefits previously available only to large contact centers at a much higher cost.
•8x8 Meet: a cloud-based video conferencing and collaboration solution that enables secure, continuous collaboration with borderless high definition (HD) video and audio communications from mobile and desktop devices anywhere in the world.
•8x8 Team Messaging: an integrated open team messaging platform to facilitate modern modes of communication with support for direct messages, public and private team messaging rooms, short messaging service ("SMS"), presence, emojis, and “@ mentions” (i.e., embedded links directed at named users). With our team messaging technology, our customers can collaborate across more than twenty third-party messaging solutions.
•8x8 CPaaS: a comprehensive set of global communications platform-as-a-service ("CPaaS") capabilities that enable business to directly integrate our platform services within their websites, mobile apps and business systems for personalized customer engagement at high scale. Our SMS, Chat App, Video Interaction, 8x8 Jitsi-as-a-Service, and Voice APIs enable companies to reach their customers anywhere with a proven, reliable global network. The AI-powered 8x8 Callstats Service provides real-time metrics and analytics on a WebRTC session to improve voice and video quality of service.

8x8 X Series
The capabilities of our core communications solutions are integrated into a comprehensive bundled offering called 8x8 X Series in addition to being available on an individual basis. X Series service plans are designed so customers pay for only those capabilities the business needs while providing businesses with an upgrade path over time as their needs evolve and grow.
Designated X1 through X8, we offer the following service plans and capabilities in the 8x8 X Series:
•X1 through X4 provide enterprise-grade voice, unified communications, video meetings and team collaboration functionality. Delivered from a single platform, these service plans provide one application for business voice, team messaging and meetings so that employees can quickly, easily and with just one click move from a chat message to a phone call to a video conference. Users can access the essential communication and collaboration features through the desktop app, mobile app or a desk phone. As a business grows, the details and features of plans can be mapped to business needs such as a lobby or store floor, a global caller organization, or to supervisor/analyst requirements. Features expected by demanding communications and collaboration customers today, such as: auto attendants; worldwide extension dialing; corporate directory with click-to-call functionality; presence, messaging and chat; call recording; call monitoring; internet fax; and the ability to interact contextually with inbound communication (email, call or chat) can be mixed and matched for customizable packages fit for business to most effectively meet the needs of individual users.
•X5 through X8 generally provide the features of X1 through X4, plus contact center functionality. These service plans deliver employee experience and deep customer engagement through integrated cloud communication, contact center software and video meetings solutions. Whether the customer is managing a startup or a large enterprise, 8x8 X Series provides the communication capabilities that contact center agents need to respond faster using instant access to relevant information and subject matter experts. Designed to ensure that customers pay for only the requirements needed, there are four X Series Cloud Contact Center service plans: the Voice-Focused Contact Center with Predictive Dialer Plan; the Voice-Focused Contact Center with Advanced Reporting Plan; the Multichannel Contact Center with Advanced Reporting Plan; and the Multichannel Contact Center with Advanced Analytics and Predictive Dialer Plan, inclusive of quality management, speech analytics, and outbound predictive AI dialer.
The result is a communication, meeting, and contact center engagement platform that enables businesses to move at the speed of employee and customer expectations, leading to less churn and more revenue. While we believe in and continue to emphasize the power of the platform as the collective offering of our solutions, we also make our solutions available independently to introduce customers to our platform and expand their platform engagement over time.
Routes to Market
We sell directly to customers or through indirect sales channels . Our indirect sales channel consists of global and regional networks of value-added resellers ("VARs") and carriers, as well as a partner network consisting of master agents and the sub-agent community, independent software vendors ("ISVs"), system integrators, and service providers selling 8x8 solutions to small, mid-market, and enterprise businesses.
Our Customers
We have a diverse and growing customer base of more than 58,000 companies in more than 150 countries, with no single customer representing 10% or more of our revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. This includes companies of every size and across a wide range of industries and use cases.
Marketing and Promotional Activities
We market our services directly to end users through a variety of means, including search engine marketing and optimization, third-party lead generation sources, industry conferences, trade shows, webinars, and digital advertising channels. We primarily sell our solutions and subscriptions through a direct sales organization, consisting of inside and field-based sales agents based in the U.S. and internationally. 
Research and Development
The cloud communications market is characterized by rapid technological changes and advancements, typical of most SaaS markets. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and services, as well as the development of enhancements and features to our existing products and services, and make these enhancements available to our customers frequently. We currently employ individuals in research, development, and engineering activities in the United States, United Kingdom, Romania, Singapore, and Philippines, as well as outsourced software development consultants around the world.
Intellectual Property
As of March 31, 2021, we have been awarded more than 250 patents, with more than 100 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our portfolio of patents, with expiration dates through 2038, and patent applications cover diverse aspects of our unified communications, video, API, collaboration and contact center services and infrastructure.
Table of Contents

Our business relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements, licenses, and intellectual property assignment agreements. We require our employees, contractors, and other third parties to sign agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and also the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while providing services to us. We also use software components in our platform that are licensed to the public under open source licenses.
See the section entitled “Risks Related to Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," for more information on our intellectual property risks.
Competition
Given the size and stage of the current market opportunity and the breadth of services provided by our communications platform, we face competition from many companies, including cloud communications providers of voice, video, chat and collaboration, contact center, and communication APIs as well as other cloud services providers, incumbent telephony companies and resellers of legacy communications equipment described below. We believe that the cost of ownership benefits and superior user experience provided by the integration of our services over a common platform differentiates our services from those offered by these competitors.
Cloud Communications Providers of Voice, Video, Chat and Collaboration, Contact Center and Communication APIs: For customers looking to implement cloud-based communications, our single services platform competes with other cloud communication providers of voice, chat, collaboration, contact center and communication APIs such as RingCentral, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., Genesys, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., Five9, Inc., NICE inContact, and Twilio Inc., among others.
Internet and Cloud Services Vendors: We also face competition from communications and cloud vendors such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Google, Inc., Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Microsoft Corporation, among others, some of which are well established in the communications industry while others have only recently begun to market cloud communications solutions.
Incumbent Telephony Companies and Legacy Equipment Providers: Our cloud-based software replaces wire line business voice services sold by incumbent telephone and cable companies such as AT&T, Inc., CenturyLink, Inc., Comcast Corporation, and Verizon Communications, Inc. often in conjunction with on-premises hardware solutions from companies like Avaya, Inc., Cisco and Mitel Networks Corp. At the same time, some of these incumbent communication companies have launched their own cloud communication services to more directly compete with us and other cloud communication providers.
See the section entitled “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," for more information on our risks related to competition.
Operations
Our operations infrastructure consists of data management, monitoring, control, and billing systems that support all of our products and services. We invest substantial resources to develop and implement our service monitoring real-time call management information system. Key elements of our operations infrastructure include customer quoting and ordering capabilities, customer provisioning, customer access control, fraud control, network security, video, voice and SMS message routing, quality monitoring, media processing and normalization, call reliability, detailed call record and message storage, transactional metering for usage-based services, product interfaces and billing and integration with third-party applications. Our software platform manages the admission, control, rating, and routing of calls and SMS messages to their appropriate destinations. The platform and its assets have been built to ensure connectivity, redundancy, security, and scalability. Our tools and processes aim at maximizing communications range, quality, and reliability.
Network Operations Center: We maintain global network operations centers around the world and employ experienced staff in voice and data operations in U.S., U.K., Romania, Indonesia, Singapore and Philippines to provide 24-hour operations support, seven days per week, whether working in our network operations centers or remotely. We use various tools including an extensive set of synthetic tests and Application Performance Monitoring to monitor and manage elements of our network and our partners' and certain larger customers’ networks in real time. Additionally, our network operations centers provide technical support to troubleshoot equipment and network problems, monitor the quality of the communications transiting on the platform and connectivity with our network (including SMS and voice providers, mobile network operators, 3rd party applications, and data partners), and monitor the health and connectivity of our customer integrations. We also rely upon the network operations centers of our telecommunications carrier partners and data center providers to augment our monitoring and response efforts. Even though our and our partner data centers have been designated as essential business, which are exempt from shelter-in-place requirements in the locations where we operate during the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, our globally dispersed operations and remotely working capabilities allow us to maintain redundant back-up operations services to minimize or eliminate the impact of any local disruptions at any of our operations centers or data centers.
In the event of a major disruption at a data center, such as a natural disaster or service disruptions caused by COVID-19 pandemic, failover between data centers or public cloud regions for 8x8 X Series is designed to occur with no or minimal disruption. In addition, most of the maintenance services performed by 8x8 do not interrupt the service we provide to customers.

Customer and Technical Support: 8x8 maintains a global customer support organization with operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, Singapore, and Romania. Customers can access 8x8 customer support services directly from the company website, or receive multi-channel technical support via phone, chat, web, and email. Emergency support is available on a 24x7 basis.
We take a lifecycle approach to customer support, supporting customers from on-boarding to deployment, and through the renewal process, to drive greater user adoption of 8x8 services. For our larger enterprise customers, our implementation methodology utilizes a deployment management team and provides active support through the "go-live" date at each customer site. We also have a Premium plus success program, and, for a certain profile of customer, a dedicated customer engagement manager, as a single point of contact for every aspect of the post-sale relationship. Finally, we offer a variety of training classes through our 8x8 University, either through instructor-led classes or self-paced online learning.
Interconnection Agreements: We have agreements with SMS, voice providers, and mobile network operators worldwide. Pursuant to these agreements, we can provide inbound and outbound telephony and SMS messaging services to traditional telecommunication systems and mobile networks worldwide through our platform via these carriers.
Regulatory Matters
In the United States, at the federal level, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") as a provider of Voice over Internet Protocal ("VoIP"), as well as state and local regulations applicable to VoIP providers. For example, regulations we are subject to include E-911 services, porting of phone numbers under specific conditions, protection of customer data generated by the use of our services, and obligations to contribute to federal programs including universal service fund and other regulatory funds as well as state and local 911 and universal service funds.
In addition to regulations at the federal and state levels, many states are also enacting privacy legislation that apply to companies such as us which collect, store, and process many types of data, including personal data. In particular, California has recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). The CCPA imposes new obligations on qualifying for- profit companies, such as us, doing business in California, and substantially increases potential liability for such companies for failure to comply with data protection rules applicable to California residents.
Internationally, we are subject to a complex patchwork of regulations that vary from country to country. Some countries have adopted laws that make the provision of VoIP services illegal within the country. Other countries have adopted laws that impose stringent licensing obligations on providers of VoIP services like ours. In many countries, it is not clear how laws that have historically been applied to traditional telecommunications providers will be applied to providers of VoIP services like us. In the European Union ("EU"), the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") imposes obligations on all companies that collect, store, and process many types of data, including personal data, like us, and substantially increases potential liability for all companies, including us, for failure to comply with data protection rules.
The effect of any future laws, regulations and orders, or any changes in existing laws or their enforcement, including the application of new taxes and regulations on communication applications like ours running over the internet, on our operations cannot be determined. See the section entitled “Risks Related to Regulatory Matters” in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors," for more information on these risks.
Geographic Areas
We have one reportable segment. Financial information relating to revenues generated in different geographic areas are set forth in Note 11, Geographical Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report.

Employees will have the ability to participate in a similar program in fiscal 2022.
