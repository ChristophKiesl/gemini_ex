Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a U.S.-based, environmentally and socially minded supplier to the global steel industry. We are dedicated entirely to mining non-thermal met coal used as a critical component of steel production by metal manufacturers in Europe, South America and Asia. We are a large-scale, low-cost producer and exporter of premium met coal, also known as hard coking coal (“HCC”), operating highly-efficient longwall operations in our underground mines based in Alabama, Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7. Our mining operations also consist of other surface met and thermal coal mines, five of which are currently under lease to third parties and four of which are not operating and are not currently planned to be operated in the future. Our met coal production totaled 7.1 million in 2020. Our natural gas operations remove and sell natural gas from the coal seams owned or leased by reducing natural gas levels in our mines.
We operate as a single reportable segment. See the financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report for our consolidated revenues, profit/loss and total assets.
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe that we have the following competitive strengths: 
Leading pure-play met coal producer focused on premium met coal products. Unlike other publicly-listed U.S. coal companies, substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of premium met coal in the global seaborne markets. All of our resources are primarily allocated to the mining, transportation and marketing of met coal. The premium HCC we produce at Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 is of a similar quality to the HCC produced in Australia. The premium nature of our HCC makes it ideally suited as a base feed coal for steel makers and results in price realizations near or above the Platts Index. Coal from Mine No. 7 is classified as a premium low-volatility ("LV") HCC and coal from Mine No. 4 is classified as premium LV to mid-volatility ("MV") HCC. The combination of low sulfur, low-to-medium ash, LV to MV, and other characteristics of our coal, as well as our ability to blend them, makes our HCC product an important component within our customers’ overall coking coal requirements. As a result, our realized price has historically been slightly above, in line with or at a slight discount to the Platts Index. Other publicly-listed U.S. coal companies sell a higher proportion of lower quality met coals, including high-volatility, semi-soft coking coal (“SSCC”), and pulverized coal injection (“PCI”) coal. These lower quality coals typically have lower realized prices compared to LV and MV met coals due to their relative availability and lower quality characteristics. Additionally, these companies typically have significant thermal coal production that further reduces their realized price and operating margin per metric ton. As a result of our premium met coal, we are able to achieve higher realized prices and operating margins relative to other U.S. met coal producers. 
World-class Blue Creek provides us with a high-return growth project. Blue Creek represents one of the last remaining large scale untapped premium quality, high volatility ("High Vol") A coal reserves in the U.S. with 103.0 million metric tons of recoverable reserves and we have the ability to acquire adjacent reserves that would increase the total reserves to over 154 million metric tons with a mine life of approximately 50 years assuming a single longwall operation. High Vol A has traditionally priced at a slight discount to the Australian premium LV and the U.S. LV coals; however we have observed extended periods in which they achieved a premium over these indices. We expect High Vol A coals will continue to become increasingly scarce as a result of Central Appalachian producers mining thinner and deeper reserves, which is expected to continue to support prices. We believe this creates an opportunity for Blue Creek to take advantage of favorable pricing dynamics driven by the declining supply of premium High Vol A coals. On February 19, 2020, we announced the commencement of the development of the Blue Creek project with expected capital expenditures related to this project in 2020 of $25.0 million. Due to the uncertainties regarding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its overall impact on the global economy, in the first quarter of 2020, we decided to delay the capital expenditures related to this project. We now have delayed the development of this project until at least the summer of 2021.
Highly flexible cost structure protects through-the-cycle profitability. We have “variabilized” our cost structure in our labor, royalties and logistics contracts, increasing the proportion of our cost structure that varies in response to changes in HCC prices based on a variety of indices. Our Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA") with the United Mine Workers of America ("UMWA"), combined with our flexible rail, port and barge logistics and our royalty structure, results in a highly variable operating cost profile that allows our cash cost of sales to move with changes in the price we realize for our coal. Approximately two-thirds of our cash cost of sales relate to the cost of production at our mines, while the remaining one-third relates to our logistics costs from mine to port as well as royalties. Our logistics costs are structured to reduce cash requirements 
in lower HCC price environments and to increase cash requirements within a range with higher HCC prices. Our royalties are calculated as a percentage of the price we realize and therefore increase or decrease with changes in HCC prices. Our CBA includes variable elements that tie compensation to HCC prices. In addition, we can adjust our usage of continuous miner units in response to HCC pricing. Our variable cost structure dramatically lowers our cash cost of sales if our realized price falls, while being effectively capped in higher price environments allowing us to generate significant operating cash flow. Our highly flexible cost structure provides us with a key competitive advantage relative to our competitors and which we expect should allow us to remain profitable in all coal market conditions. 
Significant logistical cost advantage to the seaborne market. Our two operating mines and Blue Creek are located approximately 300 miles from our export terminal capacity in Mobile, Alabama and have alternative transportation routes to move our coal to port. These alternatives include direct rail access at the mine sites and a wholly-owned barge load-out facility, enabling us to utilize the lowest cost option between the two at any given point in time. We believe our logistics costs are highly competitive. In addition, we have a contract with the Port of Mobile in Alabama, that provides us up to 8.0 million metric tons of annual port capacity through July 2026 for our coal at very competitive rates. The total annual throughput capacity of the McDuffie Coal Terminal at the Port of Mobile in Alabama is approximately 27.2 million metric tons and this coal terminal is presently utilized for all of our coal exports. We believe, and representatives of the McDuffie Coal Terminal have informed us that they believe, that there is ample capacity to support the full production rates of Blue Creek, and we are working with the McDuffie Coal Terminal to achieve the needed capacity. Our proximity to port contrasts with the approximately 400-mile distances for major Central Appalachian met coal producers to access their nearest port, the Port of Hampton Roads, Virginia. Our proximity to port and the flexibility of our logistics networks underpin our logistical cost advantage compared to other U.S. met coal producers. 
We sell our coal to a diversified customer base of blast furnace steel producers, primarily located in Europe, South America and Asia. We enjoy a shipping time and distance advantage serving customers throughout the Atlantic Basin relative to competitors located in Australia and Western Canada. This advantage results in a higher margin for our met coal. Our strategic location is enhanced by our long-tenured, well-established customer portfolio, which includes significant recurring sales to multiple customers in excess of 10 years. 
High realized prices and low variable cost structure drive industry leading margins. The coal from our mines is competitive in quality with the premium HCC produced in Australia, which is used to set pricing for the industry. The combination of low sulfur, low-to-medium ash, LV to MV and high coking strength drives our consistently high price realization relative to other U.S. met coal producers who typically focus on lower rank met coals. We believe Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7 are two of the lowest cost met coal mines in North America. Our low cost position is derived from our operations’ favorable geology, automated long-wall mining methods, and significant flexibility allowed under our CBA. Additionally, given our highly flexible cost structure, we believe we will be able to maintain our industry leading margins in all coal market conditions, which we expect should allow us to continue to outperform our competitors. 
Clean balance sheet and tax asset to drive robust cash flow generation. Unlike other U.S. coal producers in our peer group, we have no pension or OPEB legacy liabilities with manageable surety bond requirements. With minimal legacy liabilities, we are not burdened by the annual fixed obligations that are typically associated with these types of liabilities. Our clean balance sheet and its low sustaining capital expenditure requirements position us to generate strong cash flows across a range of met coal price environments. Additionally, we expect our cash flows to benefit from a low cash tax rate as a result of our significant NOLs. As a result of these tax assets, and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) beginning after December 31, 2017 (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), we believe our effective cash tax rate will be approximately 0%, exclusive of the AMT credit refunds, until our NOLs generated prior to 2018 are fully utilized or expire, which will enable strong cash conversion from our operating profits. 
Disciplined financial policies to ensure stable performance. We believe maintaining financial discipline will provide us with the ability to manage the volatility in our business resulting from changes in met coal prices. We intend to preserve a strong and conservative balance sheet, with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to support our operations. As such, we will seek to maintain a conservative financial leverage target of 1.50 - 2.00x based on normalized EBITDA and seek to maintain minimum liquidity of $100 million. We plan to continually evaluate our liquidity needs based on our estimated capital needs. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $243.5 million of available liquidity consisting of $31.6 million of borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility and $211.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the event we generate cash flow in excess of the needs of our business, we plan to take a holistic approach to capital allocation and will evaluate a range of options, including debt repayment. We will seek to preserve our capital structure with low financial leverage that is largely free from legacy liabilities in order to ensure maximum free cash flow generation. 
Highly experienced leadership team with deep industry expertise. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Walter J. Scheller, III, is the former CEO of Walter Energy and has eight years of direct experience managing Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, and over 30 years of experience in longwall coal mining. Furthermore, following the acquisition of certain assets of Walter Energy, we hired several key personnel with extensive direct operational experience in met coal longwall mining, including our Chief Operating Officer, Jack Richardson, and our Chairman, Stephen D. Williams. We have a strong record of operating safe mines and are committed to environmental excellence. Our dedication to safety is at the core of all of our overall operations as we work to further reduce workplace incidents by focusing on policy awareness and accident prevention. Our continued emphasis on enhancing our safety performance has resulted in zero fatal incidents as compared to the national fatal incidence rate for underground coal mines in the United States of 0.006 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as well as total reportable incidence rates of 3.94 at Mine No. 4 and 3.06 at Mine No. 7 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is considerably lower than the national total reportable incidence rate for all underground coal mines in the United States of 4.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which represents the latest data available. 
Strong focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Investors and other third parties are increasingly focused on sustainability matters, and we are committed to reducing the release of greenhouse gases (“GHG”). GHG emissions are produced as a by-product of mining activities, as operations in underground metallurgical coal mines produce coal bed methane. With a view towards being an industry leader in environmental performance, we are actively engaged in several initiatives that occur before, during and after mining to reduce GHG emissions, including the capture of coalbed methane. Currently, the Company is able to capture approximately 67% of the methane that is produced as part of our mining operations through direct pipelines as well as our low-quality gas plant. Much of this methane is sold into the natural gas market. The remainder of the methane is released through our mines’ ventilation systems as coal mine methane (“CMM”) emissions. These emissions that are released into the environment are extremely diluted. We have also partnered with a third-party to utilize new technology to increase the efficiency of methane reductions where practical. Currently, we have planned to install the first full-scale methane destroying unit in early 2021, as discussed under “Our Business Strategies - Capitalize on opportunities for technological innovation to continue to reduce our impact on the environment.” 

From its inception, the Company has participated in the EPA’s voluntary program aimed at CMM emission reductions. We are also proud to participate in the EPA’s voluntary GHG reporting program which the EPA is using to improve its estimates of national GHG emissions. The Company’s focus on reducing GHG emissions has proven effective, as the Company’s annual Toxic Release Inventory, which is required annually by the EPA, demonstrates that we do not have any reportable air emissions.   
Our Business Strategies 
Our objective is to increase stockholder value through our continued focus on asset optimization and cost management to drive profitability and cash flow generation. Our key strategies to achieve this objective are described below:
Maximize profitable production. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we produced 7.1 million metric tons of met coal from Mine No. 7 and Mine No. 4. We have the flexibility in our CBA that allows us to increase annual production with minimal incremental capital expenditures. Based on our management’s operational experience, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce at or close to this capacity in a safe and efficient manner, and with a comparable cost profile to our current costs, should market conditions warrant. 
Maximize organic growth. In the first quarter of 2020, we announced the commencement of the development of Blue Creek into a new, world-class longwall mine located in Alabama near our existing mines. Due to COVID-19, we delayed spending the $25.0 million that we budgeted for the development of Blue Creek until at least summer 2021. The new single longwall mine at Blue Creek is expected to have the capacity to produce an average of 3.9 million metric tons per annum of premium High-Vol A met coal over the first ten years of production. Once fully developed, we expect Blue Creek to be a transformational investment that will increase annual production capacity by 54% and expand our product portfolio to our global customers, offering three premium hard coking coals that are expected to achieve the highest premium met coal prices in the seaborne markets. We control approximately 103.0 million metric tons of recoverable reserves at Blue Creek and have the ability to acquire adjacent reserves that would increase total recoverable reserves to over 154 million metric tons at Blue Creek. Blue Creek is expected to have a mine life of approximately 50 years assuming a single longwall operation.
We expect Blue Creek’s estimated production cost per short ton to be in the first quartile of the U.S. and global seaborne hard coking coal cost curve and to be approximately 25 to 30% lower than our existing mines today. We believe the combination of a low production cost and the high quality of the High Vol A product, if we achieve the expected price 
realizations, will generate some of the highest met coal margins in the U.S., generate strong investment returns and achieve a rapid payback across a range of met coal price environments.
We expect to invest approximately $550 to $600 million over five years to develop Blue Creek once development begins. Based on the current schedule, we expect first development tons from continuous miner units to occur in 2023 with the longwall scheduled to start up in 2025. Our strong cash flow generation and current available liquidity, as well as the ability to finance $110 - $120 million of capital expenditures through equipment leases, allows us to be opportunistic as we evaluate funding options for Blue Creek.
Maintain and further improve our low and variable cost structure. While we have already achieved significant structural cost reductions at our two operating mines, we see further opportunities to reduce our costs over time. Our CBA with the UMWA allows for these ongoing cost optimization initiatives. For example, in our CBA, we have additional flexibility in our operating days and alternative work schedules as compared to certain optional and more expensive provisions under the predecessor, Walter Energy, Inc. ("Walter Energy"), collective bargaining agreement. We have variable elements that tie compensation to HCC prices. Additionally, our CBA enables us to contract out work under certain circumstances. We believe these types of structural incentive provisions and workforce flexibility in the initial CBA are helpful to further align our organization with operational excellence and to increase the proportion of our costs that vary in response to changes in the HCC price. 
Broaden our marketing reach and maintain strong correlation between realized coal prices and the Platts Index. We have implemented a strategy to improve both our sales and marketing focus, with a goal of achieving better pricing relative to the Platts Index, which includes: (i) opportunistic selling into the spot met coal market and (ii) selected instances of entering into fixed price contracts. Each of these elements is intended to further embed our coal product among a broader group of steel customers. Traditionally, we have predominantly marketed our coal to European and South American buyers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our sales geographic customer mix was 56% in Europe, 25% in South America and 19% in Asia. Since February 2017, we have had an arrangement with Xcoal Energy & Resource (“Xcoal”) to serve as Xcoal’s strategic partner for exports of LV HCC into certain markets. Under this arrangement, Xcoal takes title to and markets coal that we would historically have sold on the spot market to certain markets, in an amount of the greater of (i) 10% of our total production during the applicable term of the arrangement or (ii) 250,000 metric tons. While the volumes being sold through this arrangement with Xcoal are relatively limited, we are positioned to potentially benefit from Xcoal’s expertise and relationships across all coal that we sell. To that end, we also have an incentive-based arrangement with Xcoal to cover other tonnage, in the event Xcoal is able to offer us a higher realized price relative to the Platts Index than we have previously achieved.
Capitalize on opportunities for technological innovation to continue to reduce our impact on the environment. We strive to ensure that our business is focused on limiting environmental impact and on being an environmental steward in the communities where we live and work. We focus our opportunities for technological innovation around GHG emissions, water management, waste management and biodiversity impact. As described above, the Company currently captures approximately 67% of the coalbed methane that is produced during our mining activities as part of our commitment to reduce the Company’s GHG emissions. We are then able to sell this gas into the natural gas market. In addition to capturing pipeline quality gas, the Company also operates a low-quality gas plant, which is able to improve the quality of ordinarily unsaleable gas that would otherwise escape to the atmosphere. The improved gas is then sold and used by consumers. This plant operates using a complex system that concentrates the methane by removing other gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. We are also exploring technologies with a third party for destroying CMM. To prove one such technology, the Company built a pilot or demonstrator plant. This plant successfully operated from 2014 to 2017. During the demonstration period, the plant effectively destroyed coal mine methane released from our underground operations. We and a third party also have plans to install the first full-scale methane destroying unit in early 2021. We also successfully achieved a 99.8% compliance record with the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program, which addresses water pollution by regulation point source discharges. This reflects that we only had two minor instances of non-compliance with water quality standards within the annual period ending in the second quarter of 2020 and each of these were related to heavy rainfall events. We currently have a goal to reduce water usage at our current facilities by 25% by 2030. The Company’s management and board of directors (the "Board") are increasingly focused on these and other opportunities for technical innovation.
Description of Our Business 
Our underground mining operations are headquartered in Brookwood, Alabama and as of December 31, 2020, based on a reserve report prepared by Marshall Miller, were estimated to have approximately 97.5 million metric tons of recoverable reserves located in west central Alabama between the cities of Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. Operating at approximately 2,000 feet below the surface, the Mines No. 4 and No. 7 are two of the deepest underground coal mines in North America. The met coal is mined using longwall extraction technology with development support from continuous miners. 
Our two operating mines and Blue Creek are located approximately 300 miles from our export terminal at the Port of Mobile in Alabama, which we believe to be the shortest mine-to-port distance of any U.S.-based met coal producer. Our low and variable cost structure, flexible and efficient rail and barge network underpins our cost advantage and dependable access to the seaborne markets. We sell our coal to a diversified customer base of blast furnace steel producers, primarily located in Europe, South America and Asia. We enjoy a shipping time and distance advantage serving our customers throughout the Atlantic Basin relative to competitors located in Australia and Western Canada.
Our HCC, mined from the Southern Appalachian region of the United States, is characterized by low-to-medium volatile matter (“VM”) and high coke strength after reaction (“CSR”). These qualities make our coal ideally suited as a coking coal for the manufacture of steel. As a result of our high quality coal, our realized price has historically approximated the Platts Premium Low Volatility (“LV”) Free-On-Board (“FOB”) Australia Index price (the “Platts Index”). In contrast, coal produced in the Central Appalachian region of the United States is typically characterized by medium-to-high VM and a CSR that is below the requirements of the Australian Index price. 
The met coal from our Mines No. 4 and No. 7 is sold as a high quality LV and MV met coal. Mines No. 4 and No. 7 are located near Brookwood, Alabama, and are serviced by CSX railroad. A coal producer is typically responsible for transporting the coal from the mine to an export coal-loading facility. Exported coal is usually sold at the loading port, with the buyer responsible for further transportation from the port to their location. Both mines also have access to our barge load-out facility on the Black Warrior River. Service via both rail and barge culminates in delivery to the Port of Mobile in Alabama, where shipments are exported to our international customers via ocean vessels. Substantially all of our met coal sales consist of sales to international customers. 
We also own mineral rights for approximately 103.0 million additional metric tons of recoverable reserves at Blue Creek located to the northwest of Mine No. 4, based on a reserve report prepared by Stantec. We have the ability to acquire adjacent reserves that would increase total reserves to over 154 million metric tons at Blue Creek. According to our third party reserve report, the met coal reserve base of Blue Creek is a high quality High Vol A coal that is characterized by low-sulfur and high CSR. 
Coal Preparation and Blending 
Our met coal mines have preparation and blending facilities convenient to each mine. The met coal preparation and blending facilities receive, blend, process and ship met coal that is produced from the mines. Using these facilities, we are able to ensure a consistent quality and efficiently blend our met coal to meet our customers’ specifications. 
Marketing, Sales and Customers 
Met coal prices can differ substantially by region and are impacted by many factors, including the overall economy, demand for steel, location, market, quality and type of met coal, mine operation costs and the cost of customer alternatives. The major factors influencing our business are the global economy and demand for steel. Our operations’ high quality met coal is considered among the highest quality met coals in the world and is preferred as a base met coal in our customers’ blends. Our marketing strategy is to focus on international markets mostly in Europe and South America where we have a shipping time and distance advantage and where our met coal is in demand. 
We focus on long-term customer relationships where we have a competitive advantage. We sell most of our met coal under fixed supply contracts primarily with indexed pricing terms and volume terms of one to three years. Some of our sales of met coal can, however, occur in the spot market as dictated by available supply and market demand. Our business is not substantially dependent on any contract, such as a contract to sell the major part of our products or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which our business depends to a material extent. For more information regarding our customers, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
We have an arrangement with Xcoal to serve as Xcoal’s strategic partner for exports of LV HCC into certain markets. Xcoal has specialized marketing capabilities and deep technical expertise as the largest met coal marketer in the United States. Our arrangement with Xcoal is expected to expand the geographic reach of our customers through Xcoal’s global presence. Xcoal has 20 offices worldwide, including in Brussels, the UAE, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Mumbai, and Rio de Janeiro. We expect to be able to leverage Xcoal’s more than 30 year history selling coal to key European and Asian steel customers to further improve the selling prices of our met coal relative to the global Platts Index. 
Trade Names, Trademarks and Patents 
As part of the acquisition of certain assets of Walter Energy, we acquired all intellectual property, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names and trade secrets, owned by Walter Energy and its subsidiaries and used or held for use in the business or our assets. Promptly following the closing of the acquisition, Walter Energy, was required to discontinue the use of its name (and any other trade names or “d/b/a” names utilized by its subsidiaries) and may not subsequently change its name to or otherwise use or employ any name which includes the words “Walter.” We do not believe that any one such trademark is material to our individual segments or to the business as a whole. 
Competition 
Substantially all of our met coal sales are exported. Our major competitors are businesses that sell into our core business areas of Europe, South America and Asia. We primarily compete with producers of premium met coal from Australia, Canada, Russia, Mozambique and the United States. The principal factors on which we compete are met coal prices at the port of delivery, coal quality and characteristics, customer relationships and the reliability of supply. The demand for our met coal is significantly dependent on the general global economy and the worldwide demand for steel. Although there are significant challenges in the current economy, we believe that we have competitive strengths in our business areas that provide us with distinct advantages. 
Suppliers 
Supplies used in our business include petroleum-based fuels, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation supplies, lubricants and other raw materials as well as spare parts and other consumables used in the mining process. We use third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs, drilling services and construction. We believe adequate substitute suppliers are available and we are not dependent on any one supplier; however, we procure some equipment from a concentrated group of suppliers, and obtaining this equipment often involves long lead times. Occasionally, demand for such equipment by mining companies can be high and some types of equipment may be in short supply. We continually seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on reducing our costs while improving quality and service. 
Environmental Responsibility and Sustainability
The Company takes pride in its environmental record and strives to be an industry leader in environmental stewardship. The Company recently released its inaugural environmental, social and governance sustainability report that was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") Standards -- Core Option and highlights the Company's strong environmental record.
We continually invest in new technologies to lessen our environmental impact and to improve our efficiencies and productivity. Our executive leadership team is focused on establishing qualitative and quantitative goals that hold us accountable to our investors, employees, customers, community, as well as other stakeholders. As noted above, we are actively engaged in the EPA’s voluntary programs to reduce and report GHG emissions and to improve estimates of national GHG emissions. With regard to the Company’s water management efforts, we have a strong environmental compliance record with the EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, which addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into the waters of the United States. We also monitor adjacent streams and groundwater wells quarterly in order to determine if these water supplies could potentially have been affected by mining operations. Waste water, or water used for mining or processing of coal, is stored in locations such as impoundment structures or clarifying or settling ponds. Additionally, the Company performs a minimum of at least one complete inspection of all tailing impoundments at intervals not to exceed seven calendar days as required by federal regulation, and all of the Company’s tailing impoundments are classified as “low-hazard” structures. We continue to improve our land reclamation efforts, which has yielded success across all of our sites and facilities. We began an aggressive reclamation campaign in 2017, which has successfully reduced reclamation liability by 1,333 acres. Finally, the Company is highly proactive in planning all ongoing and future activities to minimize negative impacts to wildlife and their habitats by mining activities. All of the Company’s permit applications are reviewed by the regional U.S. Fish and Wildlife office for potential negative impacts to any protected species or habitat within the area. 
The Company has dedicated employees that oversee the Company’s efforts with respect to various environmental issues, including our efforts with respect to the programs discussed above. Through their efforts, as well as oversight by our senior management and the Board, we continue to make significant progress in improving our environmental stewardship. The Environmental, Health & Safety Committee of the Board is tasked with assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s environmental, health and safety policies, programs and initiatives, as well as reviewing and monitoring the Company’s 
compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, rules and regulations. This committee receives quarterly reports from Company management, during which the committee reviews and discusses the Company’s various environmental, health and safety initiatives and any issues related to these areas.

The safety of our employees is a core value for us. Our health and safety policies and programs are the cornerstone of our operating philosophy and are integrated into all of our daily operations and activities. Our continued emphasis on enhancing our safety performance has resulted in total reportable incident rates at Mine No. 4 and Mine No. 7, based on Mine, Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) criteria, which are lower than the national total reportable incidence rate for all underground coal mines in the United States. This record reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. In 2018, the Company hired a new Vice President of Safety, who is responsible for developing and overseeing health and safety programs at the Company’s mines, and he regularly reports to the Environmental, Health & Safety Committee so that the Board is apprised of the Company’s safety-related efforts and challenges. 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to matters such as permitting and licensing, employee health and safety, reclamation and restoration of property and protection of the environment. In the U.S., environmental laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the federal Clean Air Act and its state and local counterparts with respect to air emissions; the Clean Water Act and its state counterparts with respect to water discharges and dredge and fill operations; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state counterparts with respect to solid and hazardous waste generation, treatment, storage and disposal, as well as the regulation of underground storage tanks; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and its state counterparts with respect to releases, threatened releases and remediation of hazardous substances; the Endangered Species Act with respect to protection of threatened and endangered species; the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to the impacts of federal actions such as the issuance of permits and licenses; and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and its state counterparts with respect to environmental protection and reclamation standards for mining activities. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement, continuation or expansion of exploration or production at our operations. These laws are constantly evolving and may become more stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws have not yet been promulgated and in certain instances are undergoing revision or judicial review. These laws and regulations, particularly new legislative or administrative proposals (or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations) related to the protection of the environment, could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or, along with analogous foreign laws and regulations, our customers’ ability to use our products. 
Due in part to the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, along with changing interpretations of these requirements, violations occur from time to time in our industry and at our operations. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and environmental compliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term environmental liabilities. To the extent that these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be reduced. We believe that our major North American competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus do not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to foreign producers and operators who may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations. In addition, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, applicable legislation and its production methods. 
Permitting and Approvals 
Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining and natural gas operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state and local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration project for production of coal or gas may have on the environment, the public and our employees. In addition, we must also submit a comprehensive plan for mining and reclamation upon the completion of mining operations. The requirements are costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration, production or expansion at our operations. Typically, we submit necessary mining permit applications several months, or even years, before we anticipate mining a new area. 
Applications for permits and permit renewals at our mining and gas operations are subject to public comment and may be subject to litigation from third parties seeking to deny issuance of a permit or to overturn the applicable agency’s grant of the permit application, which may also delay commencement, continuation or expansion of our mining and gas operations. Further, regulations provide that applications for certain permits or permit modifications in the U.S. can be delayed, refused or revoked if an officer, director or a stockholder with a 10% or greater interest in the entity is affiliated with or is in a position to control another entity that has outstanding permit violations or has had a permit revoked. Significant delays in obtaining, or denial of, permits could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Mine Safety and Health 
The MSHA, under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) and the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the “MINER Act”), as well as regulations adopted under these federal laws impose rigorous safety and health standards on mining operations. Such standards are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including, but not limited to: training of mine personnel, mining procedures, ventilation, blasting, use of mining equipment, dust and noise control, communications and emergency response procedures. For instance, MSHA implemented a rule in August 2014 to reduce miners’ exposure to respirable coal dust, which reduced respirable dust standards for certain occupants and miners and required certain monitoring of shift dust levels. In August 2016, Phase III of MSHA’s respirable dust rule went into effect, further lowering the respirable dust standards. Separately, MSHA has implemented a rule imposing a requirement on certain continuous mining machines, requiring operators to provide proximity detection systems. MSHA monitors compliance with these laws and standards by regularly inspecting mining operations and taking enforcement actions where MSHA believes there to be non-compliance. These federal mine safety and health laws and regulations have a significant effect on our operating costs. 
Workers’ Compensation and Black Lung 
We are insured for workers’ compensation benefits for work related injuries that occur within our operations. Workers’ compensation liabilities, including those related to claims incurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected payments using historical data of the operating subsidiary or combined insurance industry data when historical data is limited. Beginning on June 1, 2020, the Company has a deductible policy where the Company is responsible for the first $1.0 million for each workers' compensation related claim from any of our employees. 
In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are responsible for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, the Mine Act and the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977 (together, the “Black Lung Benefits Act”), each as amended, and are insured under a guaranteed cost insurance policy beginning on April 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018 for black lung claims of any of our employees. From June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2020, the Company had a deductible policy where the Company is responsible for the first $0.5 million for each black lung claim from any of our employees. 
We also assumed all of the black lung liabilities of Walter Energy and its U.S. subsidiaries. We are self-insured for these black lung liabilities and have posted $17.0 million in surety bonds and $8.5 million of collateral recognized as short term investment in addition to maintaining a black lung trust of $3.0 million that was acquired from Walter Energy. We received a letter from the Department of Labor on February 21, 2020 under its new process for self-insurance renewals that would require us to increase the amount of collateral posted to $39.8 million, but we have appealed such increase. Changes in the estimated claims to be paid or changes in the amount of collateral required by the Department of Labor may have a greater impact on our profitability and cash flows in the future.” Under the Black Lung Benefits Act, as amended, each coal mine operator must make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to January 1, 1970. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on production; however, this excise tax does not apply to coal shipped outside the United States. Based on our limited sales of coal in the United States, we do not expect to incur a material expense related to this excise tax. However, the excise tax may result in a material expense to us in the future if our coal sales in the United States significantly increase. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes significant changes to the federal black lung program, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and the establishment of a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program. In addition to possibly incurring liability under federal statutes we may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims. For additional information, please see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are responsible for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease under federal law."
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act 
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”) requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the Federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”) or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under the SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. The Alabama Surface Mining Commission reviews and approves SMCRA permits in Alabama. 
SMCRA permit provisions include requirements for coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil removal, storage and replacement, selective handling of overburden materials, mine pit backfilling and grading, subsidence control for underground mines, surface drainage control, mine drainage and mine discharge control, treatment and revegetation. These requirements seek to limit the adverse impacts of coal mining and more restrictive requirements may be adopted from time to time. 
Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or otherwise secure the performance of reclamation obligations. The Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a general funding fee on all coal produced. The proceeds are used to reclaim mine lands closed or abandoned prior to 1977. On December 7, 2006, the Abandoned Mine Land Program was extended for another 15 years. 
 We maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at our mining complexes. Such areas and impoundments are subject to comprehensive regulation. Structural failure of an impoundment can result in damage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as create liability for related personal injuries, property damages and injuries to wildlife. Some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and the assessment of damages arising out of such failure. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for related fines and penalties. 
On December 12, 2008, the OSM finalized rulemaking regarding the interpretation of the stream buffer zone provisions of SMCRA, which confirmed that excess spoil from mining and refuse from coal preparation could be placed in permitted areas of a mine site that constitute waters of the U.S. The rule was subsequently vacated based, in part, upon the fact that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service was not consulted with respect to possible effects on endangered species under terms of the Endangered Species Act. On December 20, 2016, the OSM published a new, finalized “Stream Protection Rule,” setting standards for “material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area” that are applicable to surface and underground mining operations. However, on February 16, 2017, former President Trump signed a joint congressional resolution disapproving the Stream Protection Rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. Accordingly, the regulations in effect prior to the Stream Protection Rule apply, including OSM’s 1983 rule, which requires coal companies to keep operations 100 feet from streams or otherwise minimize any damage. It remains unclear whether and how additional actions by the Biden Administration could further impact regulatory or enforcement activities pursuant to the SMCRA. 
Drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition referred to as “acid mine drainage” (“AMD”). Treatment of AMD can be costly. Although we do not currently face material costs associated with AMD, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs in the future. 
Surety Bonds/Financial Assurance 
We use surety bonds and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds or other acceptable security to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. The amount of security required to be obtained can change as the result of new federal or state laws, as well as changes to the factors used to calculate the bonding or security amounts. 
Surety bond rates have increased in recent years and the market terms of such bonds have generally become less favorable. In addition, the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds has decreased. Bonding companies may also require posting of collateral, typically in the form of letters of credit to secure the surety bonds. Moreover, the changes in the market for coal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to bankruptcies involving prominent coal producers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their responsibilities. In response to these bankruptcies, the OSM issued a Policy Advisory in August 2016 to state agencies that are authorized under the SMCRA to implement the act in their states, notifying those state agencies that the OSM would more closely review self-bonding arrangements. Certain states had previously announced that they would no longer accept self-bonding to secure reclamation obligations under the state mining 
laws. Although the Policy Advisory was rescinded in October 2017, some states may be reluctant to approve self-bonding arrangements. This may lead to increased demand for other forms of financial assurance, which may strain capacity for those instruments and increase our costs of obtaining and maintaining the amounts of financial assurance needed for our operations. These actions, individually and collectively, may increase the amount of financial assurance needed and limit the types of acceptable instruments, straining the capacity of the surety markets to meet demand. This may increase the time required to obtain, and increase the cost of obtaining, the required financial assurances. Although Alabama’s regulatory framework technically allows for self-bonding, as a practical matter, due to the onerous regulatory requirements for self-bonding, mining companies in Alabama utilize surety bonds, collateral bonds, or letters of credit to meet their financial assurance requirements. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding surety bonds with parties for post-mining reclamation at all of our mining operations totaling $40.8 million, $17.0 million for black lung liabilities and $3.6 million for miscellaneous purposes. 
Climate Change 
Global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention, with widespread concern about the impacts of human activity, especially the emission of greenhouse gas (“GHG”), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Some of our operations, such as methane release resulting from met coal mining, directly emit GHGs. Further, the products that we produce result in the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by end-users. Laws and regulations governing emissions of GHGs have been adopted by foreign governments, including the European Union and member countries, U.S. regulatory agencies, individual states in the U.S. and regional governmental authorities. While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, almost one-half of the states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Further, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government that are intended to limit emissions of GHGs by enforceable requirements and voluntary measures. 
In December 2009, the EPA published findings that GHG emissions present an endangerment to public health and welfare because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. The EPA’s findings focus on six GHGs, including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide (which are emitted from coal combustion) and methane (which is emitted from coal beds). The findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, including rules that regulate emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities. In May 2010, the EPA adopted regulations that, among other things, established Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V permit reviews for certain large stationary sources, such as coal-fueled power plants, that are potential major sources of GHG emissions. The so-called Tailoring Rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the PSD and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD or Title V programs. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed changes needed to bring EPA’s air permitting regulations in line with Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit decisions on greenhouse gas permitting. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2016 and the public comment period closed on December 16, 2016. It is unclear when a final rule will be issued and/or whether and how additional actions by the Biden Administration could impact further regulatory developments in this area. 
In June 2010, Earthjustice petitioned the EPA to make a finding that emissions from coal mines may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare, and to list them as a stationary source subject to further regulation of emissions. On April 30, 2013, the EPA denied the petition. Judicial challenges seeking to force the EPA to list coal mines as stationary sources have likewise been unsuccessful to date. If the EPA were to make an endangerment finding in the future, we may have to further reduce our methane emissions, install additional air pollution controls, pay certain taxes or fees for our emissions, incur costs to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations as they now exist at our underground coal mines or perhaps curtail coal production. 
In addition, in August 2015, the EPA announced three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. However, on March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order directing the EPA to review all three actions and, if appropriate, initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise the rules consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. Accordingly, on December 20, 2018, the EPA published a 
proposed rule to amend the standards for new, modified and reconstructed stationary power plants. Also, on July 8, 2019, the EPA published a final replacement rule that would "reduce the compliance burden" of the Clean Power Plan. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing federal agencies, including the EPA, to immediately review all federal regulations promulgated during the last four years that conflict with specified objectives, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. If the Clean Power Plan is retained in its original form, it could have a material adverse impact on the demand for thermal coal nationally. While the Clean Power Plan does not affect our marketing of met coal, the continued regulatory focus could lead to future GHG regulations for the mining industry and its steelmaking customers, which ultimately could make it more difficult or costly for us to conduct our operations or adversely affect demand for our products. 
Demand for met coal and natural gas also may be impacted by international efforts to reduce GHG emissions. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The text of the Paris Agreement calls for nations to undertake “ambitious efforts” to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2º C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5º C above pre-industrial levels; reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible; and take action to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs, among other requirements. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which took effect on February 19, 2021. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the commitments set forth in the international accord. It is possible that the Paris Agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations will have adverse effects on the market for met coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuel products. 
    Methane must be expelled from our underground coal mines for mining safety reasons. Our gas operations extract methane from our underground met coal mines prior to mining. With the exception of some methane that is vented into the atmosphere when the met coal is mined, much of the methane is captured and sold into the natural gas market and used as fuel. If regulation of GHG emissions does not exempt the release of methane, we may have to curtail met coal production, pay certain taxes or fees for our emissions or incur costs to purchase credits that allow us to continue operations as they now exist at our underground met coal mines. 
     The existing laws and regulations or other current and future efforts to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions could adversely impact the demand for, price of and value of our products and reserves. As our operations also emit GHGs directly, current or future laws or regulations limiting GHG emissions could increase our own costs. Although the potential impacts on us of additional climate change regulation are difficult to reliably quantify, they could be material. 
    Finally, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our services and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. 
Clean Air Act 
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining may occur through permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to particulate matter, such as fugitive dust, or fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller. The Clean Air Act indirectly affects our mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, ozone and other compounds emitted by steel manufacturers, coke ovens and coal-fired utilities. As described above, existing and proposed regulations also subject GHG emissions to regulation under the Clean Air Act. 
Clean Water Act 
The federal CWA and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect our operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged and fill materials, into waters of the United States. CWA requirements that may directly or indirectly affect our operations include the following: 
•Water Discharge. The CWA and corresponding state laws affect our operations by imposing restrictions on discharges of wastewater into creeks and streams. These restrictions, more often than not, require us to pre-treat the wastewater 
prior to discharging it. Permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. Our mining operations maintain water discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA. We believe that we have obtained all permits required under the CWA and corresponding state laws and are in substantial compliance with such permits. However, new requirements under the CWA and corresponding state laws may cause us to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results. For instance, in 2016, the EPA published stringent water quality standards for selenium. We have begun to incorporate these new standards into our current permit applications; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to meet these or any other new standards with respect to our permit applications. 
•Dredge and Fill Permits. Many mining activities, such as the development of refuse impoundments, fresh water impoundments, refuse fills, and other similar structures, may result in impacts to waters of the United States, including wetlands, streams and, in certain instances, man-made conveyances that have a hydrologic connection to such streams or wetlands. Under the CWA, coal companies are required to obtain a Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) prior to conducting such mining activities. The USACE is authorized to issue general “nationwide” permits for specific categories of activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse effects on the environment. Permits issued pursuant to Nationwide Permit 21 generally authorize the disposal of dredged and fill material from surface coal mining activities into waters of the United States, subject to certain restrictions. The USACE may also issue individual permits for mining activities that do not qualify for Nationwide Permit 21. 
 Recent regulatory actions and court decisions have created some uncertainty over the scope of CWA jurisdiction. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the USACE jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the CWA, revising regulations that had been in place for more than 25 years. The new rules could expand the scope of CWA jurisdiction, making more waters subject to the CWA’s permitting and other requirements in the case of discharges. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies published a final rule to repeal the 2015 rules. The 2015 rules and the 2019 repeal are subject to several ongoing legal challenges. Also, on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the USACE published a final rule replacing the 2015 rule, and significantly reducing the waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. Several state and environmental groups have challenged the replacement rule. As a result of such recent developments, it remains unclear whether and how the rules will be implemented.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws establish standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes generated at our various facilities. Besides affecting current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal practices. In addition, RCRA also requires certain of our facilities to evaluate and respond to any past release, or threatened release, of hazardous waste that may pose a risk to human health or the environment. 
RCRA may affect coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the proper management, handling, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Currently, certain coal mine wastes, such as earth and rock covering a mineral deposit (commonly referred to as overburden) and coal cleaning wastes, are exempted from hazardous waste management under RCRA. Any change or reclassification of this exemption could significantly increase our coal mining costs. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) and similar state laws affect our met coal mining operations by, among other things, imposing investigation and cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, joint and several liability may be imposed on operators, generators, site owners, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original activity that caused or resulted in the release of the hazardous substances. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated by coal mining and processing operations from the hazardous waste laws, the universe of materials and substances governed by CERCLA is broader than “hazardous waste” and as such even non-hazardous wastes can, in certain circumstances, contain hazardous substances, which if released into the environment are governed by CERCLA. Alabama’s version of CERCLA mirrors the federal version with the important difference that there is no joint and several liability. Liability is consistent with one’s contribution to the contamination. In addition, the disposal, release or spilling of some products used by coal companies in operation, such as chemicals, could trigger the liability provisions of CERCLA or similar state laws. Thus, we may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for properties that (1) we currently own, lease or operate, (2) we, our predecessors, or former subsidiaries have previously owned, leased or operated, (3) sites to which we, our predecessors or 
former subsidiaries, sent waste materials, and (4) sites at which hazardous substances from our facilities’ operations have otherwise come to be located. 
Endangered Species Act and Similar Laws 
The federal Endangered Species Act and other related federal and state statutes, such as the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, protect species threatened or endangered with possible extinction. Protection of threatened, endangered and other special status species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits and may include restrictions on our activities in areas containing the affected species. Also, the designation of previously unidentified threatened, endangered or special status species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans. 
Seasonality 
Our primary business is not materially impacted by seasonal fluctuations. Demand for met coal is generally more heavily influenced by other factors such as the global economy, demand for steel, interest rates and commodity prices. 
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,401 employees, of whom 970 were hourly employees and 431 were salaried employees, and of whom approximately 67.2% were covered by the UMWA CBA, which expires on March 31, 2021. We have not had any union-organized work stoppages since our inception. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees and with the unions representing our employees. We are currently renegotiating our UMWA CBA. There is no guarantee that we will reach an agreement in a timely manner, and if an agreement is not reached, there could be an interruption in production at each of our mines.
The Company prioritizes employee safety, wellbeing, personal and professional development, and diversity and inclusion. At the direction of our Standing Committees of our Board of Directors, our human resource department is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent to deliver on our strategy and the design of employee compensation, incentive, welfare and benefits programs. We focus on the following factors in order to implement and develop our human capital strategy:
•Safety of Our Employees
•Evaluation of Employee Performance, Training and Talent Development 
•Employee Health and Welfare
•Diversity and Inclusion
Safety of Our Employees
We incorporate safety principles into every aspect of our business. We are proud of our safety record, which includes a safety incident rate that is 32% better than the U.S. industry rate and an incident severity measure that is consistently less than half the national average. To achieve such results, we have established a culture of awareness and incident prevention through numerous safety initiatives including, among others:
•100% compliance with required annual MSHA safety training;
•Beginning all meetings with a safety share;
•Our "Stop and Correct Authority" that we have granted all employees, contractors, and visitors, we encourage anyone who observes unsafe acts or conditions to take corrective actions; and
•Our Safety ACTion training program, with monthly trainings scheduled specific to the tasks that each individual is asked to perform.
Evaluation of Employee Performance, Training and Talent Development
We strive to recruit, hire and retain a talented and diverse team of people. Our employees are supported with training and development opportunities to pursue their career paths and to ensure compliance with our policies. 
Our training program incorporates industry best practices and includes the following for new employees, among others: code of business conduct and ethics training, driving policy, employee handbook, safety policy and work rules. We also require 
the following annual trainings on certain topics among others: Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery, cybersecurity, diversity and harassment, employee hazard, surface retraining, underground retraining and discipline specific retraining.
We are committed to developing and retaining our workforce. Our employees make us who we are, and we offer tools to identify, grow and nurture our talent including:
•Future Leaders Development Program
•Annual Supervisor and Development Training
•Employee Education Assistance
•Annual Performance Evaluations
Employee Health and Welfare
Our compensation and benefits teams aim to develop and implement policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among the Company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. We provide our employees with competitive fixed and/or variable pay, and for eligible employees we currently provide access to medical, dental and life insurance benefits, disability coverage, 401(k) plan and employee assistance programs, among other benefits.
During the unprecedented COVID-19 global pandemic, we focused first and foremost on the safety of our employees, supporting our local community and ensuring our employees were able to remain employed. We worked with the National Mining Association and other key national and local stakeholders to secure essential industry designation for the mining industry so that our employees and their families would not have to worry about financial stability during a time of great stress in our country. We have put in place numerous safety procedures to protect our workforce during the pandemic and continue to enhance our practices to remain aligned with federal, state, local and international regulations and guidelines. Further, despite the negative impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, we have not cut salaries or hourly rates for our employees, nor have we adjusted our benefits coverage and we have not had to furlough any employees.
