Item 1.    Business
We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing the next generation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) to improve outcomes for cancer patients. By generating targeted therapies with enhanced anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability profiles, we aim to disrupt the progression of cancer and offer patients more good days. We call this our commitment to “target a better now.”
An ADC with our proprietary technology comprises an antibody that binds to a target found on tumor cells and is conjugated to one of our potent anti-cancer agents as a “payload” to kill the tumor cell once the ADC has bound to its target. ADCs are an expanding class of anticancer therapeutics, with twelve approved products and the number of agents in development growing significantly in recent years.

We have established a leadership position in ADCs with a portfolio of differentiated product candidates to address both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We have set four strategic priorities for the business:

● | execute the commercial launch for ELAHERE™ (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) (ELAHERE);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expand the ELAHERE label by moving into platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advance our clinical pipeline of novel ADCs for hematologic and solid tumors; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strengthen and expand our pipeline through both internal discovery and external partnerships.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that sound execution of these prioritized activities will create substantial short-and long-term value for shareholders, employees, patients, and other stakeholders in the Company. 
ELAHERE (Mirvetuximab Soravtansine)
Approval and Launch
ELAHERE is a first-in-class ADC targeting folate receptor alpha (FRα), a cell-surface protein over-expressed in a number of epithelial tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, and non-small-cell lung cancers. On November 14, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for ELAHERE for the treatment of adult patients with FRα positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens. The accelerated approval of ELAHERE was based on efficacy and safety outcomes from SORAYA, a single-arm trial of ELAHERE in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors express high levels of FRα. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Patients eligible for treatment with ELAHERE are selected by the VENTANA FOLR1 (FOLR1-2.1) RxDx Assay developed by Roche Tissue Diagnostics (RTD), which was also approved by the FDA on November 14, 2022. We completed the build out of our U.S. commercial infrastructure in 2022 and initiated sales in the U.S. in November 2022.
Ongoing Development
In addition to SORAYA, we are conducting MIRASOL, a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial designed to support full approval of ELAHERE. In July of 2022, we completed enrollment in MIRASOL and expect to report top-line data from this trial in the second quarter of 2023. If MIRASOL is successful, we plan to submit a marketing authorisation application, or MAA, for approval of ELAHERE for the treatment of adult patients with FRα positive, platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the second half of 2023. Additionally, our partner, Huadong Medicine, expects to submit a biologics license application to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China for ELAHERE in the same indication in the second half of 2023 to support potential approval and launch of ELAHERE in Greater China in 2024.
Beyond platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, our strategy is to move ELAHERE into platinum- sensitive disease, and to position the product as the combination agent of choice in ovarian cancer. To this end, in January 2023, we completed patient enrollment in PICCOLO, a single-arm trial of ELAHERE monotherapy in later-line FRα positive platinum-sensitive patients, and plan to report on the primary endpoint before the end of 2023. We have also generated encouraging data in recurrent platinum-sensitive disease with the combination of ELAHERE plus carboplatin and are supporting investigator sponsored trials (ISTs) with this combination in a single arm trial in the neoadjuvant setting and in a randomized trial comparing ELAHERE combined with carboplatin to standard of care in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive disease. We also initiated a single-arm Phase 2 trial (0420) of this combination followed by ELAHERE continuation in FRα-low, medium, and high patients with platinum-sensitive disease. Results from this trial and our ongoing ISTs will inform a path to the potential registration for ELAHERE plus carboplatin and, in parallel, could support compendia listing for this combination. Finally, we have initiated GLORIOSA, a randomized Phase 3 trial of ELAHERE plus bevacizumab maintenance in FRα-high recurrent platinum-sensitive disease that we believe could support label expansion.
Pivekimab Sunirine
Pivekimab sunirine (PVEK), formerly known as IMGN632, is an ADC comprised of a high-affinity antibody designed to target CD123 with site-specific conjugation to a DNA-alkylating payload of the novel IGN (indolinobenzodiazepine pseudodimer) class. Our IGNs are designed to alkylate DNA without cross-linking, which has provided a broad therapeutic index in preclinical models. We are advancing PVEK in clinical trials for patients with 

5




blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 
BPDCN is a rare form of blood cancer, with an annual incidence of between 500 and 1,000 patients in the US. In October 2020, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PVEK for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory BPDCN. Based on feedback from the FDA, we amended our ongoing 801 Phase 2 trial, known as CADENZA, to include a new cohort of up to 20 frontline BPDCN patients.
Initial enrollment in CADENZA did not distinguish between de novo BPDCN patients and those who presented with a prior or concomitant hematologic malignancy (PCHM). Although complete responses have been observed in BPDCN patients who present with PCHM, most will not achieve full hematologic recovery due to the impact of their prior or concomitant malignancy. For these patients, we believe that achieving a complete response with partial hematological recovery (CRh) is a potentially important measure of clinical benefit.
In data from the first ten patients in the pivotal CADENZA frontline cohort, we observed: 2 of 4 de novo patients achieved CR (complete response)/CRc (clinical complete response); and 4 of 6 PCHM patients achieved CR/CRc/CRh. In addition, in three frontline patients (2 de novo, 1 PCHM) enrolled prior to the opening of the pivotal cohort, all three patients achieved CR/CRc.
A Type B meeting was held in August 2022 regarding these initial data from the CADENZA trial. Based on FDA feedback on trial design provided in this meeting, the efficacy analysis will be conducted in de novo BPDCN patients with CR/CRc as the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint of duration of CR/CRc. We will enroll up to 20 de novo patients for purposes of the efficacy analysis. We will also continue to enroll PCHM patients in CADENZA to further evaluate PVEK in this population. The Company expects to report top-line data on the primary and key secondary endpoints in 2024.
We are also conducting our 802 trial for PVEK, which is a Phase 1b/2 trial designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antileukemia activity of PVEK when administered in combination with azacytidine and venetoclax to patients with relapsed and frontline CD123-positive AML. Having identified the recommended Phase 2 dose for the triplet, patients are accruing in both expansion cohorts. In December 2022, safety and efficacy findings in relapsed refractory AML and initial data in frontline AML was presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. In the first 10 frontline patients enrolled, 5/10 (50%) patients achieved a CR and 3/4 (75%) patients tested had a minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR. Based upon these results, the Company will continue enrollment in two frontline AML expansion cohorts to optimize the duration of venetoclax therapy. In addition, in December 2022, the Company announced a clinical collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. to study PVEK in combination with magrolimab in relapsed refractory AML and expects to initiate this cohort under the 802 trial in the second half of 2023. 
Other Pipeline Programs
We continue to advance our earlier-stage pipeline programs. IMGC936 is an ADC in development with MacroGenics, Inc. that is designed to target ADAM9, an enzyme over-expressed in a range of solid tumors and implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. IMGC936 incorporates a number of innovations, including antibody engineering to extend half-life, site-specific conjugation with a fixed drug-antibody ratio to enable higher dosing, and a next-generation linker and payload designed for improved stability and bystander activity. Phase 1 dose escalation was completed and expansion cohorts in non–small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer initiated in the second half of 2022. We expect to provide initial data from these cohorts in the second quarter of 2023.
IMGN151 is our next generation anti-FRα product candidate in development. This ADC integrates innovation in each of its components, which we believe may enable IMGN151 to address patient populations with lower levels of FRα expression, including tumor types outside of ovarian cancer. We began enrollment in a Phase I clinical trial evaluating IMGN151 in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer and recurrent, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers in January 2023.
Collaborations and Out-Licenses 
Over the last 40 years, we believe ImmunoGen has assembled the most comprehensive ‘‘toolbox’’ in the ADC field. Our platform technology combines advanced chemistry and biochemistry with innovative approaches to antibody optimization, with a focus on increasing the diversity and potency of our payload agents, advancing antibody-payload linkage and release technologies, and integration of novel approaches to antibody engineering. These capabilities have enabled us to generate a pipeline of novel candidates with potent anti-tumor activity and favorable safety profiles that we can develop as monotherapies and in combination with existing and novel therapies.
Collaborating on ADC development with other companies allows us to enhance our capabilities, extend the reach of our proprietary platform, mitigate expenses, and generate revenue. We have selectively licensed restricted 

6




access to our ADC platform technology to other companies to expand the use of our technology and to provide us with cash to fund our own product programs. These agreements typically provide the licensee with rights to use our ADC platform technology with its antibodies or related targeting vehicles to a defined target to develop products. The licensee is generally responsible for the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, registration, and commercialization of any resulting product candidate. As part of these agreements, we are generally entitled to receive upfront fees, potential milestone payments, royalties on the sales of any resulting products, and research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner’s request.

3 Oxford BioTherapeutics and Menarini are developing MEN 1309, an ADC targeting CD205 and utilizing our DM4 payload, pursuant to a sublicense from Amgen, which in turn licensed our maytansinoid ADC technology to develop and commercialize ADCs targeting CD205.
Below is a brief description of material business relationships underlying certain of the foregoing programs. For more information concerning these relationships with partners, including their ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, please read Note C, Collaboration and License Agreements, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Huadong
In October 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Hangzhou Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Huadong) a subsidiary of Huadong Medicine Co., Ltd., under which Huadong will exclusively develop and commercialize ELAHERE in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, which we refer to as Greater China. Under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $40 million and are eligible to receive additional payments of up to $265.0 million as certain development, regulatory, and net sales milestones are achieved. We are also eligible to receive tiered low double digit to high teen royalties as a percentage of ELAHERE commercial sales by Huadong in Greater China. Through December 31, 2022, the Company had received an aggregate of $15.0 million in milestone payments under this agreement. Although we hold the MAA, Huadong is responsible for the development and commercialization of ELAHERE in Greater China except in limited circumstances. In addition, we granted Huadong a right of first negotiation if we determine to enter into an agreement to grant a third party rights in Greater China to develop or commercialize a product, other than ELAHERE, that specifically binds to FRα. We retain all rights to ELAHERE in the rest of the world. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license.

Lilly
In February 2022, we entered into a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), pursuant to which we granted Lilly worldwide exclusive rights to research, develop, and commercialize antibody-drug conjugates based on the Company’s novel camptothecin technology. Under the terms of the license agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $13.0 million, reflecting initial targets selected by Lilly. During 2022, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Lilly selected additional targets for which we received an additional $13.0 million in non-refundable payments. Lilly may select a pre-specified number of additional targets, with the Company eligible to receive an additional $19.5 million in exercise fees if Lilly licenses the full number of remaining additional targets over a specified period following the effective date of the license agreement, with the potential for up to $1.7 billion in development and sales-based milestone payments if all targets are selected and all milestones are realized. In addition, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties, on a product-by-product basis, as a percentage of worldwide annual net sales by Lilly, based on certain net sales thresholds. Lilly is responsible for all costs associated with the research, development, and commercialization of any ensuing products. The standard termination provisions discussed below apply to this license.
Standard Termination Provisions
Standard termination provisions in our license agreements state that the partner may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time upon prior written notice to us. The agreement may also be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions. We may also terminate certain of these agreements upon the occurrence of specified events. Upon termination, the partner’s rights to our intellectual property with respect to the applicable target are canceled and could then be used by us or re-licensed for that target. Unless earlier terminated, each agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of partner’s royalty obligations, which are determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. For each product and country, royalty obligations commence upon first commercial sale of that product in that country and extend until the later of either the expiration of the last-to-expire ImmunoGen patent covering that product in that country or the expiration for that country of the minimum royalty period specified in the agreement.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
ImmunoGen has a substantial and robust intellectual property portfolio comprising over 1,800 issued patents and over 700 pending patent applications on a worldwide basis. Our intellectual property strategy centers on obtaining high quality patent protection directed to various embodiments of our proprietary technologies and product candidates. Using this strategy, our ADC technology and our product candidates are protected through a multi-layered approach. In this regard, we have patents and patent applications covering antibodies and other cell binding agents, linkers, cytotoxic payload agents (e.g., tubulin-acting maytansinoids, DNA-alkylating IGNs, and DNA-acting camptothecins), conjugation methodologies and complete ADCs, comprising one or more of these components, as well as methods of making and using each of the above. Typically, multiple issued patents and pending patent applications cover various embodiments of each of ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ product candidates.
We consider our tubulin-acting maytansinoid, DNA-alkylating IGN, and DNA-acting camptothecin cytotoxic payload agent technologies to be key components of our overall patent strategy. With regard to our tubulin-acting maytansinoid cytotoxic payload agents, we currently own 22 issued U.S. patents covering various embodiments of our maytansinoid technology including those with claims directed to certain maytansinoids, including DM4 and DM21, and methods of manufacturing DM1, DM4, and DM21, as well as methods of using the same. These issued patents are expected to remain in force until various times between 2023 and 2038. With regard to our IGN payload agents, we have 39 issued U.S. patents covering various aspects of our DNA-acting cytotoxic payload agents, which will expire at various times between 2030 and 2038. With regard to our camptothecin agents, we have an issued U.S. patent covering various aspects of our camptothecin cytotoxic payload agents, which expires in 2040. In addition, we have received or are applying for comparable patent protection in other major commercial and manufacturing jurisdictions, including Europe, Japan, and China. In nearly all cases for our maytansinoid, IGN, and camptothecin patent portfolios, we have additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these technologies which, upon issuance or grant, will extend our patent protection term over these technologies by several additional years.
Our intellectual property strategy also includes pursuing patents directed to linkers, antibodies, conjugation methods, ADC formulations and the use of specific antibodies and ADCs to treat certain diseases. In this regard, we have 22 issued patents related to many of our linker technologies, as well as additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these linker technologies, including methods of making the linkers and antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising these linkers. These issued patents are expected to remain in force until various times between 2023 and 2034. We also have 23 issued U.S. patents 

8




covering methods of assembling ADCs from their constituent antibody, linker, and cytotoxic payload agent moieties. These issued patents will expire between 2026 and 2039. In nearly all instances for both our linker and conjugation patent portfolios, we have additional pending patent applications disclosing and claiming many other related and strategically important embodiments of these technologies which, upon issuance or grant, would extend our patent protection term over these technologies by several additional years. In addition, we have received or are applying for comparable patents in other major commercial and manufacturing jurisdictions including Europe, Japan, and China. 
We also file, prosecute, and maintain a substantial portfolio of patents and patent applications specifically directed to ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ ADC candidates. In this regard, we craft a detailed patent protection strategy for each ADC as it approaches clinical evaluation. Such strategies make use of the patents and patent applications described in the preceding paragraphs, as well as ADC-specific filings, to create a multi-layered and multi-jurisdictional patent protection approach for each ADC as it enters the clinic. These ADC-specific patent strategies are intended to provide the exclusivity basis for revenue and royalties arising from commercial development of each of ImmunoGen’s and our licensees’ ADCs. In addition to the platform patent strategy described above and specific to ELAHERE, we have 21 issued U.S. patents and 15 pending U.S. applications covering various embodiments of the composition of matter and methods of treatment using ELAHERE, expiring at various times between 2031 and 2043. We have filed 5 applications for patent term extension of patents covering various aspects of ELAHERE with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We expect the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to deem one or more of these patent term extension applications allowable. We will elect to have the term of one of the patents underlying the patent term extension applications extended for the period of time set forth in the application for patent term extension. With respect to PVEK, we have 6 issued U.S. patents and 5 pending U.S. applications covering various embodiments of the composition of matter and methods of treatment using PVEK, expiring at various times between 2036 and 2043.
We expect our continued independent and collaborative work in each of these areas will lead to other patent applications. We will be the owner of all patents covering our independently generated inventions. In all other instances, we expect to either be the sole owner or co-owner of any patents covering collaboratively generated inventions insofar as they relate to co-developed products or our ADC platform technology, or otherwise have an exclusive or non-exclusive license to the technology covered by such patents.
We cannot provide assurance that pending patent applications will issue as patents or that any patents, if issued, will provide us with adequate protection against competitors with respect to the covered products, technologies, or processes. Defining the scope and term of patent protection involves complex legal and factual analyses and, at any given time, the result of such analyses may be uncertain. In addition, other parties may challenge our patents in litigation or administrative proceedings resulting in a partial or complete loss of certain patent rights owned or controlled by ImmunoGen. Furthermore, as a patent does not confer any specific freedom to operate, other parties may have patents that may block or otherwise hinder the development and commercialization of our technology.
In addition, many of the processes and much of the know-how that are important to us depend upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our key scientific and technical personnel, which skills, knowledge, and experience are not patentable. To protect our rights in these areas, we require that all employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements with us. Further, we require that all employees enter into assignment of invention agreements as a condition of employment. We cannot provide assurance, however, that these agreements will provide adequate or any meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary information. Further, in the absence of patent protection, we may be exposed to competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information.
Competition
We focus on highly competitive areas of product development. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical companies and other biotechnology firms. For example, Mersana Therapeutics, Eisai, and Sutro BioPharma have clinical-stage ADCs targeting platinum resistant ovarian cancer, and Pfizer, Seattle Genetics, Roche, Astellas, AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, GlaxoSmithKline, AbbVie, and the Menarini Group have programs to attach a cell-killing small molecule to an antibody for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as other institutions, also compete with us for promising targets for antibody-based therapeutics, for obtaining licenses and collaboration agreements with other companies to develop targets for antibody-based therapeutics, and in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel. Additionally, there are non-ADC therapies available and/or in development for the cancer types we and our partners are targeting. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed 

9




collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development, and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
In particular, competitive factors within the antibody and cancer therapeutic market include:

● | the safety, efficacy, and convenience of products;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | the timing of regulatory approvals and commercial introductions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | special regulatory designation of products, such as orphan drug and breakthrough therapy designations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the effectiveness of marketing, sales, and reimbursement efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Our competitive position depends on a combination of factors. These include effectively pursuing the development of proprietary products, the implementation of clinical development programs, the ability to appropriately manufacture, sell, and market our products, and the procurement of patent protection for our products. In addition, we must secure sufficient capital resources to accomplish all of the previously mentioned activities. 
Continued development of conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in new compounds that may compete with our product candidates. Antibodies developed by certain of these companies have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics. In the future, new antibodies or other targeted therapies may compete with our product candidates. Other companies have created or have programs to create potent cell-killing agents for attachment to antibodies. These companies may compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.

Managing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Since the first quarter of 2020, although we have experienced some delays or disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully continued to move our clinical trials forward while adapting to meet the evolving challenges of the pandemic. We implemented business continuity plans in March 2020 that enabled our workforce to remain productive while working from home until mid-September 2021, at which time our workforce returned to the office. From a regulatory perspective, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have received timely reviews of our submissions to the FDA and other health authorities covering our clinical trial applications. From a manufacturing and supply chain perspective, we believe we have sufficient inventory on hand for all of our ongoing and near-term clinical trials and to support the launch and continued commercialization of ELAHERE. COVID-19 may impact our commercial activities for ELAHERE, including patient access to testing and identification, but we will conduct commercial and medical affairs field activities in virtual formats where in-person interactions are not feasible.
Regulatory Matters
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state, and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, and export and import of drug products. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to adverse administrative or judicial actions. These actions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any such administrative or judicial action could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

10




The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical and other nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies according to current Good Laboratory Practices (cGLP) or other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | development and approval of a companion diagnostic if the FDA or the sponsor believes that its use is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------------

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a clinical protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted and clinical trials have begun. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the sponsor submits additional information that alleviates the FDA’s concerns, and the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.
Each clinical trial must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements in accordance with a protocol for each phase of the clinical trial included as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. A local or central institutional review board (IRB) acting on behalf of each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the trial until completed, and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety and dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: These trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites and to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional information about the use of the approved drug in the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of post-approval trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected or serious patient reactions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors may request meetings with the FDA to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Most sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of all trial-related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could require disclosure in the future.
Companion Diagnostics
For ELAHERE, (and potentially other of our product candidates), we work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies. For example, we partnered with RTD to develop a companion diagnostic device for ELAHERE. In conjunction with the FDA’s approval of ELAHERE, the agency also approved the VENTANA FOLR1 RxDx Assay as a companion diagnostic device to select patients eligible for treatment with ELAHERE.
If the FDA believes that a diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, the FDA may require the sponsor to develop, and obtain contemporaneous clearance or approval for a companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics can be used to identify patients likely to be more responsive to a particular therapy or at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product. They may also be useful for monitoring the response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment or doses to achieve improved safety or effectiveness.
Companion diagnostics are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA applies a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory pathway for companion diagnostics. This means that the regulatory pathway will depend on the level of risk to patients, based on the intended use of the companion diagnostic device and the controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The two primary types of marketing pathways for medical 

12




devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for use with our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway. If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are studied together to support their respective approvals, the clinical trial must meet both the IND requirements and the FDA’s companion diagnostic requirements that apply to clinical trials of significant risk devices.
The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for a companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously. 
PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete.
After approval, the use of a companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. In addition, a diagnostic test that was approved through the PMA process or one that was cleared through the 510(k) process and placed on the market will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including requirements related to device labeling and promotion, registration and listing, QSR, and medical device reporting.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies, and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may analyze and interpret data differently than we analyze and interpret the same data. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity, and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured to assure compliance with cGMPs and may also inspect clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. Priority review, which is requested at the time of BLA or NDA submission, is designed to expedite the review for drugs that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be 6 months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed, compared to 10 months under standard review. Although the FDA’s goal is to take action on priority review applications within 6 months, the agency does not always meet this goal and the review process may be significantly extended by requests for additional information or clarification from the FDA. Priority review does not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be 

13




approved in its present form. A complete response letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a complete response letter is issued, the sponsor has one year to resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if one is required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs, and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. Orphan disease indications are exempt from PREA. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA’s approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
The FDCA provides a five-year period of marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or 505(b)(2) NDA for another drug that contains the same active moiety where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the fist applicant. 
The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA (or supplement thereto) that contains reports of new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, such as clinical 

14




investigations for new indications, strength, or routes of administration. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving 505(b)(2) NDAs or ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. 
Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) an additional six months of marketing exclusivity may be available if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA (Written Request). If the Written Request does not include clinical trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those clinical trials. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. To date, we have not received any Written Requests.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of “generic” biologics—biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve-year data exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric clinical trials are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve-year data exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that meets additional requirements that show, among other things, that the product will produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. In addition, for products administered to a patient more than once, the effects of switching back and forth between the interchangeable product and a reference product on safety and efficacy will have to be evaluated. An interchangeable product may be substituted for the reference product by the pharmacy without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage, and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity, and potency.
An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances.
The FDA has issued a number of final and draft guidance documents in order to implement the law and will likely continue to publish new guidance as new issues relating to biosimilars and interchangeability are identified. The guidance documents provide the FDA’s current thinking on approaches to demonstrating that a proposed biological product is biosimilar to or interchangeable with, a reference product. Although the FDA intends to issue additional guidance documents in the future, the absence of final guidance documents covering all issues does not prevent a sponsor from seeking licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable product under the BPCIA, as evidenced by the products already approved by the FDA.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; 

15




the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA cannot approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances. For example, the FDA may approve a subsequent application for the same product in the same indication if the product is clinically superior to the previously approved drug. Additionally, orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation.
Expedited Review and Approval; Breakthrough Therapy Designation
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for the FDA’s review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-BLA or pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 days of receipt of the request. Although Fast Track does not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug.
Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all Fast-Track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase I, and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. In October 2020, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for pivekimab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory BPDCN.
Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit or on an intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity, mortality, or other clinical benefit. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. Accelerated approval does not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-approval clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker trial. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, confirm a clinical benefit during post-approval trials, or dissemination of false or misleading promotional materials would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for therapeutic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. ELAHERE was granted accelerated approval based on the results of the SORAYA trial and we plan to seek full approval on the basis of the confirmatory Phase 3 MIRASOL trial.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the sponsor will be required to comply with all post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any specific post-approval commitments that the sponsor has undertaken as part of the approval process. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain 

16




manufacturing changes, additional labeling claims, and required additional testing are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in regulatory or enforcement actions.
Approved drug products, such as ELAHERE, are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with the FDA’s promotion and advertising requirements. Compliance with these requirements will require us to expend significant time, money, and effort. 
The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion, and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. If a company, including any agent of the company or anyone speaking on behalf of the company, is found to have promoted the drug for an indication that is not in the approved label, the company may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
The FDA may withdraw an approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements to conduct post-approval studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Other Healthcare Laws 
In the U.S., activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to numerous other federal, state, and local laws designed to, for example, prevent fraud and abuse; promote transparency in interactions with others in the healthcare industry; protect the privacy of individual information; and ensure integrity of research or protect human subjects involved in research. These laws are enforced by various federal and the state enforcement authorities and non-

17




compliance, or alleged non-compliance, with such laws could adversely affect our reputation, our business and our financial results. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government Regulation.”
We may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws (which typically prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate healthcare business reimbursable by third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid), and false claims laws (which generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any false or fraudulent claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid). Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices.
Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including laws that require manufacturers to adopt certain compliance standards; disclose financial interactions with health care providers to the government and public; or report pricing information or marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to challenge.
We may need to obtain and maintain licenses for our manufacturing and distribution activities in the states in which we operate or distribute our products.
We are subject to federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs. Reporting requirements are complex and, in some instances, require reporting manufacturers to make reasonable assumptions in interpreting their obligations. 
We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain, or store personally identifiable information. Numerous U.S. federal and state laws govern the collection, use, disclosure, and storage of personal information. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.”
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain the FDA’s approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time to obtain these approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA’s approval.
Under the European Union regulatory regime, a company may submit marketing authorization applications under a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition procedure. Where the product is intended to be marketed in one EU member state, a national application for a marketing authorization is filed. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology, designated orphan medicines, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapies, and those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of HIV, AIDS and immune dysfunctions, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and viral diseases, and is optional for other medicines, which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) where it will be evaluated by the CHMP. A favorable CHMP opinion typically results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission in an implementing decision, known as a centralized marketing authorization. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all European Union member states and, by extension (after taking the corresponding national implementing measures), in Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. In general, the initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock-stops. Clock-stops allow the applicant the necessary time to provide additional information in response to questions raised by 

18




the CHMP. The clock-stops considerably extend the time taken by the CHMP to complete the evaluation of a marketing authorization application. Ordinarily, within 67 days of receipt of the positive scientific opinion provided by the EMA, the European Commission will issue a binding decision on the marketing authorization application.
The decentralized procedure allows marketing authorization applications to be submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states, whereas the mutual recognition procedure must be used if the product has been authorized in at least one EU member state on a national basis, and the applicant seeks approval progressively of the same medicinal product in one or more EU member state(s). Both the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures provide for approval by one or more “concerned” member state(s) based on an assessment of an application performed by one “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member state(s). The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days of the receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s positive assessment report, each concerned member state must approve the assessment report and related materials, unless they identify a potential serious risk to public health. Under the mutual recognition procedure, the concerned member state(s) have the same 90-day period to recognize the marketing authorization in the reference member state. The decentralized procedure contemplates a single clock-stop at day 105, which may extend the process for completing the assessment procedure. In either case, if there is a disagreement between member states during the assessment of the submitted data based on concerns about serious risks to public health, the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures will consider the matter and seek to reach a conclusion within 60 days. If this is not possible, the reference member state can escalate the issue to the EMA for arbitration. The purely national procedure results in a marketing authorization in a single EU member state. 
In relation to the United Kingdom, high quality marketing authorization applications can be submitted for an expedited 150-day assessment to be initiated. At least 90 days prior to the intended marketing authorization application submission date, applicants should request a pre-submission meeting from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). At this meeting, the applicant will provide a short summary of the dossier and, if necessary, request input on specific issues, such as consideration for an orphan marketing authorization, conditional marketing authorization or marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. When the marketing authorization applications is submitted to the MHRA, the clock will start when the application is validated for completeness of dossier for the regulatory review to commence. The assessment process involves two phases which are separated by a ‘clock-off’. At Day 80 constituting the Phase 1 of the assessment procedure, matters requiring clarification will be raised with the applicant as a letter requesting further information (RFI). Applicants must address these matters within 60 days. Phase 2 of the marketing authorization assessment process begins as soon as the MHRA receives the applicant’s responses to the RFIs. By day 150, the MHRA will provide a decision on approvability of the product. If the MHRA proposes to refuse the grant of the marketing authorization, the applicant can request a review of the decision.
In the European Union, orphan designations are assessed by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products for binding decisions to be issued by the European Commission to promote the development of medicinal products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which either affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, or where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, there can be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition already authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
If the European Commission grants an orphan designation, the developer will be entitled to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. If orphan status is maintained when the marketing authorization is granted, the medicinal product will benefit from certain economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another “similar medicinal product” applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The 10-year market exclusivity can also be broken by another company developing a similar medicinal product if the marketing authorization holder is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the marketed orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The period of market exclusivity can be reduced if the medicinal product no longer meets the orphan drug designation criteria at the end of the fifth year, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made.

enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
An equivalent regime is in place in the United Kingdom. Under the United Kingdom’s regime, there is no pre-authorization orphan designation and instead a decision is made at the point of the marketing authorization grant.
Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of ELAHERE and any other products for which we may obtain approval depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors. 
Within the U.S., third-party payors include government authorities or government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid (which provides prescription drug benefits to low-income individuals), and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors may limit coverage of certain drug products or may manage utilization of a particular product (e.g., by requiring pre-approval (known as “prior authorization”) for coverage of particular prescriptions (to allow the payor to assess medical necessity)). A third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not mean that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain net price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of new products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for any approved drug product, we may need to collect real-world evidence and conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow sales of a product at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is complex and costly.
Within the U.S., we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid or to sell products to government purchasers.
In the U.S., there have been ongoing efforts by federal and state governments to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare generally and drugs specifically. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government Regulation.” Healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access, or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our ability to obtain or maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any approved products which could materially harm our business and financial results.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and prices generally tend to be significantly lower.
Companion Diagnostics
Under the EU regulatory regime, namely Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR) on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVD), companion diagnostics (CDx) are classified as Class C devices, the second highest risk level of IVD. In order to place a CDx on the EU market, the general safety and performance of the CDx must be subject to a conformity assessment, which involves a notified body, an independent body designated by a regulatory authority in an EU Member State to assess the conformity with the regulatory requirements under the IVDR. 

20




As part of the conformity assessment procedure, the notified body will seek a scientific opinion on the suitability of the CDx with the corresponding medicinal product from either a competent authority of an EU member state or the EMA. Where the CDX is to be used exclusively with a medicinal product that falls within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure, then the EMA must be consulted. If the corresponding medicinal product has already been authorized, the notified body will consult the competent authority responsible for the authorization.
To initiate this process the notified body will provide an “intention-to-submit-letter” to the EMA at least 3 months prior to the planned submission date of request for a scientific opinion on suitability. This letter also triggers the timely appointment of the rapporteur by the CHMP or, in the case of advanced therapy medicinal products, a Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) rapporteur will be appointed and the CHMP coordinator will work closely with them. 
After the EMA’s acceptance of the “intention-to-submit-letter”, the notified body can submit questions concerning timing, regulatory or procedural aspects to the EMA within 2 months of the planned submission and request a pre-submission meeting with the EMA and relevant stakeholders.
The IVDR requires the EMA’s consultation to be based on the draft summary of safety and performance and draft instructions for use of the device as submitted by the notified body. Aspects including the scientific validity of a biomarker, analytical performance and clinical performance are assessed whereas the technical documentation dossier for the device, including the adequacy of the analytical measures used to assess these aspects is assessed by the notified body as part of the conformity assessment. 
The EMA will provide its opinion within 60 days of the start of its scientific assessment, with a maximum extension of a further 60 days on justified grounds. If further clarification is required by the CHMP/CAT, a list of questions may be issued to the notified body within this 60-day extension. The CHMP will then issue a scientific opinion to the notified body on the suitability of the device in relation to the corresponding medicinal product by, at the latest, the end of this extension period. The notified body will then give due consideration to this opinion when issuing its decision and will convey a final decision to the EMA in the form of a formal notification to the EMA. 
Manufacturing
We contract with third-party contract manufacturers (CMOs) for the manufacture of our product candidates for both our clinical and potential commercial needs. Our CMO network manufactures antibody, linker, and payload, and conjugates the foregoing to create bulk drug substance of our product candidates and processes the bulk drug substance into vialed and labeled drug product for use in humans. Although we are reliant on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our CMOs.
CMOs are subject to extensive governmental regulations, and we depend on them to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with cGMP. We have an established quality assurance program designed to ensure that the CMOs involved in the manufacture of product candidates do so in accordance with cGMP and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations. We believe that our current CMO network complies with such regulations.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 277 full-time employees, of whom 155 were engaged in research and development activities. Of the 155 research and development employees, 116 employees hold post-graduate degrees, of which 44 hold Ph.D. degrees and 12 hold M.D. degrees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our employee relations are good.
We have entered into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, members of our board of directors, and consultants. Further, we have entered into assignment of invention agreements with all of our employees.
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain, and develop the highest quality talent.

Corporate Responsibility
At ImmunoGen, how we do our jobs is just as important as what we do. Our culture is about putting people first, innovation, accountability, and teamwork. Living these values means managing our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts effectively. 
We are currently laying the foundation for our ESG strategy. Over the last two years, we formalized board oversight over our ESG strategy and recently begun to assess our material ESG issues. This materiality assessment considers ESG topics from a wide range of stakeholders and global reporting frameworks. In the coming months, we will narrow our focus to a few priority areas that are most material for our business. We are committed to operationalizing these ESG topics through a top-down approach and maintaining consistent stakeholder engagement to continue to evolve our strategy.
