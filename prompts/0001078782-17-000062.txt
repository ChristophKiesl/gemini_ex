ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

Background.

Wellness Center USA, Inc. ("WCUI" or the Company) was incorporated in June 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company initially engaged in online sports and nutrition supplements marketing and distribution. Later, the Company expanded into additional businesses within the healthcare and medical sectors through acquisitions, including Psoria­Shield Inc. (PSI), National Pain Centers, Inc. (NPC), and StealthCo Inc. (SCI), d/b/a Stealth Mark, Inc. The Company currently operates in the following business segments: (i) distribution of targeted Ultra Violet ("UV") phototherapy devices for dermatology; (ii) management of top-tier medical practices in the interventional and multi­modal pain management sector; and (iii) authentication and encryption products and services. The segments are operated, respectively, through PSI, NPC and SCI. 
PSI

PSI was incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on June 17, 2009. On August 24, 2012, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock in PSI. PSI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and operated by Psoria Development Company LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (PDC), a joint venture between WCUI/PSI and The Medical Alliance, Inc., a Florida corporation (TMA).

PSI designs, develops and markets a targeted ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy device called the Psoria-Light. The Psoria-Light is designated for use in targeted PUVA photochemistry and UVB phototherapy and is designed to treat certain skin conditions including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis (eczema), seborrheic dermatitis, and leukoderma. 

Psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo, are common skin conditions that can be challenging to treat, and often cause the client significant psychosocial stress. Clients may undergo a variety of treatments to address these skin conditions, including routine consumption of systemic and biologic drug therapies which are highly toxic, reduce systemic immune system function, and come with a host of chemotherapy like side effects. Ultraviolet (UV) phototherapy is a clinically validated alternate treatment modality for these disorders.

Traditionally, non-targeted UV phototherapy was administered by lamps that emitted either UVA or UVB light to both diseased and healthy skin. While sunblocks or other UV barriers may be used to protect healthy skin, the UV administered in this manner must be low dosage to avoid excessive exposure of healthy tissue. Today, targeted UV phototherapy devices administer much higher dosages of light only to affected tissue, resulting in clearance in the case of psoriasis and eczema, and repigmentation in the case of vitiligo, at much faster rates than non-targeted (low dosage) UV treatments.

Targeted UV treatments are typically administered to smaller total body surface areas, and are therefore used to treat the most intense parts of a clients disease. Non-targeted UV treatment is typically used as a follow-up and for maintenance, capable of treating large surfaces of the body. Excimer laser devices (UVB at 308nm) are expensive and consume dangerous chemicals (Xenon and Chlorine). Mercury lamp devices (UVB and/or UVA) require expensive lamp replacements regularly and require special disposal (due to mercury content). Additionally, mercury lamp devices typically deliver wavelengths of light below 300nm. While within the UVB spectrum, it has been shown that wavelengths below 300nm produce significantly more sunburn type side effects than do wavelengths between 300 and 320nm without improvement in therapeutic benefit.

The Psoria-Light is a targeted UV phototherapy device that produces UVB light between 300 and 320 nm as well as UVA light between 350 and 395nm. It does not require consumption of dangerous chemicals or require special environmental disposal, and is cost effective for clinicians, which should result in increased patient access to this type of treatment. It has several unique and advanced features that we believe will distinguish it from the non-targeted and targeted UV phototherapy devices that are currently being used by dermatologists and other healthcare providers. These features include the following: the utilization of deep narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) LEDs as light sources; the ability to produce both UVA or NB-UVB therapeutic wavelengths; an integrated high resolution digital camera and client record integration capabilities; the ability to export to an external USB memory device a PDF file of treatment information including a patent pending graph that includes digital images plotted against user tracked metrics which can be submitted to improve medical reimbursements; an accessory port and ability to update software; ease of placement and portability; advanced treatment site detection safety sensor; international language support; a warranty which includes the UV lamp(s); and a non-changeable treatment log (that does not include HIPPA information).

The Psoria-Light consists of three components: a base console, a color display with touchscreen control, and a hand-held delivery device with a conduit (or tether) between the handheld device and the base console. PSI requires clearance by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market and sell the device in the United States as well as permission from TUV SUD America Inc., PSIs Notified Body, to affix the CE mark to the Psoria-Light in order to market and sell the device in countries of the European Union. 

To obtain FDA clearance and permission to affix the CE mark, PSI was required to conduct EMC and electrical safety testing, which it completed in the second quarter of 2011. PSI received FDA clearance on February 11, 2011 (no. K103540) and was granted permission to affix the CE mark on November 10, 2011. In its 510(k) application with the FDA (application number K103540), PSI asserted that the Psoria-Light was substantially equivalent in intended use and technology to two predicate devices, the X -Trac Excimer Laser, which has wide acceptance in the medical billing literature and has a large installed base in the U.S., and the Dualight, another competing targeted UV phototherapy device.

PSI has established an ISO 13485 compliant quality system for the Psoria-Light, which was first audited in the third quarter of 2011. This system is intended to ensure PSI devices will be manufactured in a controlled and reliable environment and that its resources follow similar practices and is required for sales in countries requiring a CE mark. PSI has also received Certified Space Technology designation from the Space Foundation, based on PSIs incorporation of established NASA-funded LED technology.

PSI began Psoria-Light Beta deployment in January 2012. It is currently operating at a loss, and there is no assurance that its business development plans and strategies will ever be successful. PSIs success depends upon the acceptance by healthcare providers and clients of Psoria-Light treatment as a preferred method of treatment for psoriasis and other UV-treatable skin conditions. Psoria-Light treatment appears to have been beneficial to clients, without demonstrable harmful side effects or safety issues, as evidenced by more than 10,000 treatments completed on more than 1,000 clients, domestically and Mexico, since 2012. In order for the Company to continue PSI operations it will need additional capital and it will have to successfully coordinate integration of PSI operations without materially and adversely affecting continuation and development of other Company operations.

NPC

NPC was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on January 24, 2014. It is an Illinois-based management services provider. It was acquired by the Company on February 28, 2014 and is operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
