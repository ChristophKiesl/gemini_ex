History
We were incorporated in 1997 as a New York corporation and named Energy East Corporation. In 2008, Iberdrola acquired Energy East Corporation and we changed our name to Iberdrola USA, Inc. In 2013, we completed an internal corporate reorganization to create a unified corporate presence for the Iberdrola brand in the United States, bringing all of its U.S. energy companies under Iberdrola USA, Inc. The internal reorganization resulted in the concentration of our principal businesses in two major subsidiaries: Networks, which holds all of our regulated utilities; and Renewables, which holds our renewable and thermal generation businesses.
On December 16, 2015, we completed the acquisition of UIL Holdings Corporation, or UIL, and changed our name to Avangrid, Inc. Immediately following the completion of the acquisition, former UIL shareowners owned 18.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of AVANGRID, and Iberdrola owned the remaining shares.
Networks
Overview
Networks, a Maine corporation, holds our regulated utility businesses, including electric generation, transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales. Networks serves as a super-regional energy services and delivery company through the eight regulated utilities it owns directly:
•New York State Electric & Gas Corporation, or NYSEG, which serves electric and natural gas customers across more than 40% of the upstate New York geographic area;
•Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, or RG&E, which serves electric and natural gas customers within a nine-county region in western New York, centered around Rochester;
•The United Illuminating Company, or UI, which serves electric customers in southwestern Connecticut;
•Central Maine Power Company, or CMP, which serves electric customers in central and southern Maine;
•SCG, which serves natural gas customers in Connecticut;
•CNG, which serves natural gas customers in Connecticut;
•BGC, which serves natural gas customers in western Massachusetts; and
•Maine Natural Gas Corporation, or MNG, which serves natural gas customers in several communities in central and southern Maine.
The demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. Demand for electricity in each of the states in which Networks operates tends to increase during the summer months to meet cooling load or in winter months for heating load while statewide demand for natural gas tends to increase during the winter to meet heating load.
The following table sets forth certain information relating to the rate base, number of customers and the amount of electricity or natural gas provided by each of Networks’ regulated utilities as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020:

(1)“Rate base” means the net assets upon which a utility can receive a specified return, based on the carrying value of such assets. The rate base is set by the relevant regulatory authority and typically represents the value of specified property, such as plants, facilities and other investments of the utility. These rate base values have been calculated using the best estimates as of December 31, 2020.
During the last five years, Networks has invested $7.2 billion enhancing its delivery network with greater capacity and improved reliability, environmental security and sustainability, efficiency and automation. Networks continuously improves its grid to accommodate new requirements for advanced metering, demand response and enhanced outage management, while improving its flexibility for the integration and management of distributed energy resources, or DER.
New York
In 2020, the nine hydroelectric plants owned by NYSEG and RG&E generated approximately 120 million kilowatt-hours, or kWh, of clean hydropower, which is enough energy to power approximately 17,000 homes across New York State, assuming an average electricity consumption of 600 kWh per month per customer. See “—Properties—Networks” for more information regarding Networks’ electric generation plants. 
Networks also holds an approximate 20% ownership interest in the regulated New York TransCo, LLC, or New York TransCo. Through New York TransCo, Networks has formed a partnership with affiliates of Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, Consolidated Edison, Inc., National Grid, plc, and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. to develop a portfolio of interconnected transmission lines and substations to fulfill the objectives of the New York energy highway initiative, a proposal to install up to 3,200 MW of new electric generation and transmission capacity in order to deliver more power generated from upstate New York power plants to downstate New York.
Maine
CMP owns 78% of the Maine Electric Power Corporation, or MEPCO, a single-asset 182-mile 345kV electric transmission line from the Maine/New Brunswick border to Wiscasset, Maine.
In 2018, the New England Clean Energy Connect, or NECEC, transmission project, a joint bid proposed by CMP and Hydro-Québec, was selected by the Massachusetts electric utilities and the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, or DOER, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s 83D clean energy Request for Proposal, or RFP. The proposed NECEC transmission project includes a 145-mile transmission line linking the electrical grids in Québec, Canada and New England. The project, which has an estimated cost of approximately $1.0 billion, would add 1,200 MW of transmission capacity to supply Maine and the rest of New England with power from reliable hydroelectric generation. As of December 31, 2020, we have spent approximately $180 million on the NECEC project. For further discussion of the NECEC project, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.

Renewables
The Renewables business, based in Portland, Oregon, is engaged primarily in the design, development, construction, management and operation of generation plants that produce electricity using renewable resources and, with more than 70 renewable energy projects, is one of the leaders in renewable energy production in the United States based on installed capacity. Renewables’ primary business is onshore wind energy generation, which represented approximately 90% of Renewables’ combined installed capacity as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Renewables produced approximately 18,760,000 MWh of energy through wind power generation. Renewables had a pipeline of approximately 21,200 MW (approximately 16,200 MW - onshore and approximately 5,000 MW - offshore) of future renewable energy projects in various stages of development as of December 31, 2020.
Renewables' growing strategic business is offshore wind. Renewables has access to two lease areas off the coast of the eastern United States that it is developing through Vineyard Wind, LLC, a 50-50 partnership with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, or CIP, a fund management company based in Denmark. In total, the lease areas have the potential to generate up to 5,000 MW of renewable energy. Renewables is currently developing two wind projects with CIP in one of the lease areas, which is 166,886 acres. The second lease area, acquired in 2018, is 132,370 acres and located over 16 nautical miles off the coast of Massachusetts.
Vineyard Wind LLC is developing the Vineyard Wind I project, an 800 MW utility-scale offshore wind project located 15 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. The Vineyard Wind I project is expected to generate clean energy for over 400,000 households and businesses in Massachusetts and reduce carbon emissions by over 1.6 million tons per year. The project has 20-year PPA’s with the electric distribution companies in Massachusetts with an average price of $88.77/MWh, which represents a price for 50% of the project that starts at $65/MWh and escalates 2.5% annually, and a price for the other 50% of the project that starts at $74/MWh and escalates 2.5% annually. Vineyard Wind LLC is also developing the Park City Wind project, an 804 MW project located in the same lease area as the Vineyard Wind I project, that will deliver clean, reliable energy to the residents of Connecticut through contracts with the electric distribution companies in Connecticut. The project has 20-year PPA’s with the electric distribution companies in Connecticut, including UI, with an average price of $79.83/MWh, which is based on a starting price of $62.50 that escalates at 2.5% annually. With respect to the Park City Wind project, Vineyard Wind has agreed to have good faith negotiations to adjust the price if the project benefits from any improvements to the profitability 
of the project for having access to investments tax credits, or ITCs, in excess of 18%. Both projects are expected to be commissioned in the mid-2020’s, subject to permitting and contract negotiation. 
Renewables also has rights to a federal offshore wind lease area located more than 27 miles off the coast of North Carolina, which has the potential to generate up to 2,500 MW of renewable energy for Virginia and North Carolina. The lease area was acquired through a competitive federal auction in 2017 and is 122,405 acres.
Typically, Renewables enters into long-term lease agreements with property owners who lease their land for renewable energy projects. Electricity generated at a wind project is then transmitted to customers through long-term agreements with purchasers. There are a limited number of turbine suppliers in the market. Renewables’ largest turbine suppliers, Siemens-Gamesa, in which Iberdrola had an 8.1% ownership interest until that was sold in February 2020, and GE Wind, in the aggregate supplied turbines that accounted for 72% of Renewables’ installed wind capacity as of December 31, 2020.
To monetize the tax benefits resulting from production tax credits, or PTCs, and accelerated tax depreciation available to qualifying wind energy projects, Renewables has entered into “tax equity” financing structures with third party investors for a portion of its wind farms. Renewables holds two operating wind farms under these structures through limited liability companies jointly owned by one or more third party investors. These investors generally provide an up-front investment and, in some cases, payments over time for their membership interests in the financing structures. In return, the investors receive specified cash distribution allocations and substantially all of the tax benefits generated by the wind farms, until such benefits achieve a negotiated return on their investment. Upon attainment of this target return, the sharing of the cash flows and tax benefits flip, with Renewables receiving substantially all of these amounts thereafter. We also have an option to repurchase the investor’s interest within a certain timeframe after the target return is met. Renewables maintains operational and management control over the wind farm businesses, subject to investor approval of certain major decisions. See “—Properties—Renewables” for more information regarding Renewables’ wind power generation properties.
Additionally, as part of the Renewables portfolio, Renewables operates two thermal generation facilities in the United States, with 636 MW of combined capacity as of December 31, 2020. Renewables worked closely with the City of Klamath Falls, Oregon to develop the Klamath Plant, which has a current capacity of 536 MW. The Klamath Plant operates by creating two useful forms of energy, electricity and process steam, from a single fuel source of natural gas. In addition, Renewables operates a highly flexible 100 MW Klamath Peaking Plant adjacent to the Klamath Plant, providing customers of Renewables additional capability to meet their peak summer and winter power needs.
In addition to its wind assets, Renewables operates four solar photovoltaic facilities with an installed capacity of 130 MW. The solar photovoltaic facilities produced over 242,000 MWh of renewable energy for the year ended December 31, 2020. Solar accounted for 1.5% of the total renewable energy generation from Renewables in these same periods.
Renewables is pursuing the continued development of a large pipeline of wind energy projects in various regions across the United States. Each site features a range of different atmospheric characteristics that ultimately drive the selection of turbine technology for the proposed project. As part of Renewables’ wind resource assessment investigation, critical atmospheric parameters such as mean wind speed, extreme wind speed, turbulence intensity, and mean air density are characterized to represent long-term conditions for over 20 years. The summary wind characteristics are then combined with a terrain, or orography, analysis to assess siting risks in order to mitigate any future operations and maintenance concerns that may arise due to improper turbine siting.
Renewables maintains close relationships with key turbine suppliers, including Siemens-Gamesa, GE, Vestas and others in order to identify the turbine technology that safely delivers the lowest cost of energy for each candidate project in its portfolio. Renewables has deployed the following mix of turbines under this strategy. See “—Properties—Renewables” for more information regarding Renewables’ turbine technology.

Renewables focuses on ensuring solar projects deliver the lowest cost of energy safely. This requires detailed information on first cost, long term performance and reliability of project components including solar panels, trackers and inverters – particularly as technology continues to advance. Renewables relies upon a wide network of experienced solar industry consultants to provide expert advice on project development, performance specifications, manufacturing quality assurance and equipment selection. These consultants range from Tetra Tech Inc. for environmental permitting support, to companies such as DNV GL, Clean Energy Associates, and PI Berlin to advise on energy estimation, equipment performance expectations, and equipment quality audits.
The Renewables meteorology team supports the commercial development of wind and solar energy projects in Renewables’ pipeline by performing a wide variety of detailed investigations and analyses to characterize the expected wind and solar energy production from a proposed wind farm or solar plant in its pre-construction phase of development. These investigations include measuring the wind or solar resource with several well-equipped meteorological masts and using energy modeling software packages that characterize the gross energy and relevant losses. For wind projects, state of the art laser-based and acoustic-based remote sensing equipment and computational fluid dynamics modeling software are used. The Renewables fleet of measurement masts consists of approximately 100 wind meteorological towers and 12 solar meteorological stations that are currently in operation. Additionally, a total of six light detecting and ranging and six sonic detecting and ranging remote sensing devices are deployed or available for deployment at sites across the United States to support wind project development. These remote sensing devices allow hub-height wind speed measurement from a ground-based sensor that can be rapidly deployed and moved as the project matures or changes in nature. The resulting pre-construction energy production estimates that utilize these measurements have been shown to be accurate in a multi-year internal study that compares results to actual, operational data at wind plants in a benchmarking analysis. This study provides a critical feedback loop that is used to define methodology requirements for future pre-construction energy production estimates to ensure confidence in project investment. Renewables’ commitment to obtaining robust atmospheric measurement is driven by a company culture that values business case confidence and understands the role that accurate meteorological data plays in the pursuit of this goal.
Regulatory Environment and Principal Markets
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Among other things, the FERC regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. Certain aspects of Networks’ businesses and Renewables’ competitive generation businesses are subject to regulation by the FERC.
Pursuant to the FPA, electric utilities must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with the FERC, which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of the FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Unless otherwise exempt, any person that owns or operates facilities used for the wholesale sale or transmission of power in interstate commerce is a public utility subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. The FERC regulates, among other things, the disposition of certain utility property, the issuance of securities by public utilities, the rates, the terms and conditions for the transmission or wholesale sale of power in interstate commerce, interlocking officer and director positions, and the uniform system of accounts and reporting requirements for public utilities.
With respect to Networks’ regulated electric utilities in Maine, New York and Connecticut, the FERC governs the return on equity, or ROE, on all transmission assets in Maine and Connecticut and certain New York TransCo assets in New York. The FERC also oversees the rates, terms and conditions of the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, interconnection service in interstate commerce (which applies to independent power generators, for example) and the rates, terms and conditions of wholesale sales of electric energy in interstate commerce. This includes cost-based rates, market-based rates and the operations of regional capacity and electric energy markets in New England administered by an independent entity, ISO New England, Inc., or ISO-NE, and in New York, administered by the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO. The FERC approves CMP's, UI's and New York TransCo's regulated electric utilities transmission revenue requirements. Wholesale electric transmission revenues are recovered through formula rates that are approved by the FERC. CMP’s, MEPCO’s and UI’s electric transmission revenues are recovered from New England customers through charges that recover costs of transmission and other transmission-related services provided by all regional transmission owners. NYSEG’s and RG&E’s electric transmission revenues are recovered from New York customers through charges that recover the costs of transmission and other transmission-related services provided by all transmission owners in New York. Several of our affiliates have been granted authority to engage in sales at market-based rates and blanket authority to issue securities and have also been granted certain waivers of the FERC reporting and accounting regulations available to non-traditional public utilities; however, we cannot be assured that such authorizations or waivers will not be revoked for these affiliates or will be granted in the future to other affiliates.
Pursuant to a series of orders involving the ROE for regionally planned New England electric transmission projects, the FERC established a base-level transmission ROE of 11.14%, as well as providing a 50-basis point ROE adder on Pool Transmission Facilities for participation in the regional transmission organization, or RTO, for New England and a 100-basis point ROE incentive for projects included in the ISO-NE Regional System Plan that were completed and on line as of December 31, 2008. Certain other transmission projects received authorization for incentives up to 125 basis points.
Since 2011, several parties have filed four separate complaints with the FERC against ISO-NE and several New England transmission owners, or NETOs, including UI, CMP and MEPCO, claiming that the current approved base ROE of 11.14% was not just and reasonable, seeking a reduction of the base ROE and a refund to customers for the 15-month refund periods beginning October 1, 2011 (Complaint I), December 27, 2012 (Complaint II), July 31, 2014 (Complaint III) and April 29, 2016 (Complaint IV). ). For more information on this matter see Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
The FERC has the right to review books and records of “holding companies,” as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or PUHCA 2005, that are determined by the FERC to be relevant to the companies’ respective FERC-jurisdictional rates. We are a holding company, as defined in PUHCA 2005.
The FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1.3 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct 2005, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, has been certified by the FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization for North America responsible for developing and overseeing the enforcement of electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the United States. FERC-approved reliability standards may be enforced by the FERC independently, or, alternatively, by NERC and the regional reliability organizations with frontline responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to the FERC oversight.
The gas distribution operations of NYSEG, RG&E, SCG, CNG and BGC are subject to the FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, with respect to their gas purchases/sales and contracted transportation/storage capacity. FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for certain violations of up to $1.3 million per day for violations. FERC also has the authority to order the disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA and EPAct 2005.
Market Anti-Manipulation Regulation
The FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market pursuant to the FPA, the Commodity Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, including our businesses’ energy transactions and operations in the United States. With regard to the physical purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas, the gathering storage, transmission and delivery of these energy commodities and any related trading or hedging transactions that some of our operating subsidiaries undertake, our operating subsidiaries are required to observe these anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and CFTC. The FERC and CFTC hold substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1.3 million per day per violation, to order disgorgement of profits and to recommend criminal penalties.
State Regulation
Networks’ regulated utilities are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions, including with regard to their rates, terms and conditions of service, issuance of securities, purchase or sale of utility assets and other accounting and operational matters. NYSEG and RG&E are subject to regulation by the NYPSC; CMP and MNG are subject to regulation by the MPUC; UI, SCG and CNG are subject to regulation by the PURA; and BGC is subject to regulation by the DPU. The NYPSC, MPUC and the Connecticut Siting Council, or CSC, exercise jurisdiction over the siting of electric transmission lines in their respective states, and each of the NYPSC, MPUC, PURA and DPU exercise jurisdiction over the approval of certain mergers or other business combinations involving Networks’ regulated utilities. In addition, each of the utility commissions has the authority to impose penalties on these regulated utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations and their orders. In June 2019, the New York State legislature passed a new law titled the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, or CLCPA, which could have significant impacts on the operations of electric and gas utilities in New York. A Climate Action Council has been formed consistent with the CLCPA, and that Council will be providing guidance to New York State in reaching aggressive renewable and emission reduction goals delineated in the CLCPA.
Networks’ regulated distribution utilities deliver electricity and/or natural gas to all customers in their service territory at rates established under cost of service regulation. Under this regulatory structure, Networks’ regulated distribution utilities file rate cases to recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on its costs and earn a return on their capital investment in utility assets. For more information on our regulated utilities’ most recent rate cases and other regulatory matters see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
As a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, most of Networks’ distribution utilities’ customers have the opportunity to purchase their electricity or natural gas supplies from third-party energy supply vendors. Most customers in New York, however, continue to purchase such supplies through the distribution utilities under regulated energy rates and tariffs. In Maine, CMP customers can also purchase electric supply from competitive providers, but the majority receive baseline standard offer service that is provided through a MPUC procurement process. Networks’ regulated utilities in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts and MNG purchase electricity or natural gas from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual approved costs of these supplies on a pass-through basis, as well as certain costs associated with industry restructuring, through reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted.
State public utility commissions may also have jurisdiction over certain aspects of Renewables’ competitive generation businesses. For example, in New York, certain Renewables’ generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to “lightened” regulation by the NYPSC. As such, the NYPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to those generation assets located in New York. In Texas, Renewables’ operations within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, footprint are not subject to regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT. In California, Renewables’ generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities’ operations. 
RTOs and ISOs
Networks’ regulated electric utilities in New York, Connecticut and Maine, as well as some of Renewables’ generation fleet, operate in or have access to organized energy markets, known as RTOs or independent system operators, or ISOs, particularly NYISO and ISO-NE. Each organized market administers centralized bid-based energy, capacity and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy, capacity and ancillary service markets operate, how market participants bid, clear, are dispatched, make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Certain of these markets set prices, referred to as Locational Marginal Prices that reflect the value of energy, capacity or certain ancillary services, based upon geographic locations, transmission constraints and other factors. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of market power. Some markets limit the prices of the bidder based upon some level of cost justification. These market structures impact the bidding, operation, dispatch and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services.
The RTOs and ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations within their respective regions. Each of Networks’ transmission-owning subsidiaries in New York, Connecticut and Maine has transferred operational control over certain of its electric transmission facilities to its respective ISOs, such as ISO-NE and NYISO.
Environmental, Health and Safety
Permitting and Other Regulatory Requirements
Networks. Similar to Renewables, Networks’ distribution utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations in connection with the environmental, health and safety effects of its operations. The distribution utilities of Networks are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commission with respect to the siting and approval of electric transmission lines, with the exception of UI, the siting of whose transmission lines is subject to the jurisdiction of the CSC, and with respect to pipeline safety regulations for intrastate gas pipeline operators.
The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, requires that detailed statements of the environmental effect of Networks’ facilities be prepared in connection with the issuance of various federal permits and licenses. Federal agencies are required by NEPA to make an independent environmental evaluation of the facilities as part of their actions during proceedings with respect to these permits and licenses.
Under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has issued regulations that control the use and disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls, or PCBs. PCBs were widely used as insulating fluids in many electric utility transformers and capacitors manufactured before the federal Toxic Substances Control Act prohibited any further manufacture of such PCB equipment. Fluids with a concentration of PCBs higher than 500 parts per million and materials (such as electrical capacitors) that contain such fluids must be disposed of through burning in high temperature incinerators approved by the EPA. For our gas distribution companies, PCBs are sometimes found in the distribution system. Networks tests any distribution piping being removed or repaired for the presence of PCBs and complies with relevant disposal procedures, as needed.
Under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to regulations adopted by the EPA. All of Networks’ subsidiaries have complied with the notification and application requirements of present regulations, and the procedures by which the subsidiaries handle, store, treat and dispose of hazardous waste products comply with these regulations.
Before the environmental best practices laws and regulations were implemented in the last quarter of the 20th century, utility companies, including Networks’ subsidiaries, often disposed of residues from operations by depositing or burying them on-site or at off-site landfills or other facilities. Typical materials disposed of included coal gasification byproducts, fuel oils, ash and other materials that might contain PCBs or otherwise be hazardous. In recent years it was determined that such disposal practices, under certain circumstances, can cause groundwater contamination.
Renewables. Renewables’ projects are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Whether a project is sited onshore or offshore dictates the complexity of the permitting framework.
Many states where Renewables’ projects are located have laws that require state agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of a proposed project prior to granting state permits or approvals. Generally, state agencies evaluate similar issues as federal agencies, including the project’s impact on wildlife, historic or cultural sites, aesthetics, wetlands and water resources, agricultural operations and scenic areas. States may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. Additional approvals may be required for specific aspects of a project, such as stream or wetland crossings, 
impacts to designated significant wildlife habitats, storm water management and highway department authorizations for oversize loads and state road closings during construction. Permitting approvals related to transmission lines may be required in certain cases.
Renewables’ projects also are subject to local environmental and regulatory requirements, including county and municipal land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements. Permitting at the local municipal or county level often consists of obtaining a special use or conditional use permit under a land use ordinance or code, or, in some cases, rezoning is required for a project. Obtaining a permit usually requires that Renewables demonstrate that the project will conform to certain development standards specified under the ordinance so that the project is compatible with existing land uses and protects natural and human environments. Local or state regulatory agencies may require modeling and measurement of permissible sound levels in connection with the permitting and approval of Renewables’ projects. Local or state agencies also may require Renewables to develop decommissioning plans for dismantling the project at the end of its functional life and establish financial assurances for carrying out the decommissioning plan.
In addition to permits required under state and local laws, Renewables’ projects may be subject to permitting and other regulatory requirements under federal law. For example, if an offshore wind project is sited in federal waters (beyond the 3 nautical mile state jurisdictional line), the project will require approval from the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM as well as other federal cooperating agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or Army Corps, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard. If an onshore project is located near wetlands, a permit may be required from the Army Corps, with respect to the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States. The Army Corps may also require the mitigation of any loss of wetland functions and values that accompanies the project’s activities. Renewables may be required to obtain permits under the federal Clean Water Act for water discharges, such as storm water runoff associated with construction activities, and to follow a variety of best management practices to ensure that water quality is protected and impacts are minimized. Renewables’ projects also may be located, or partially located, on lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Therefore, Renewables may be required to obtain and maintain BLM right-of-way grants for access to, or operations on, such lands. To obtain and maintain a grant, there must be environmental reviews conducted, a plan of development implemented and a demonstration that there has been compliance with the plan to protect the environment, including measures to protect biological, archeological and cultural resources encountered on the grant.
Renewables’ projects may be subject to requirements pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, or ESA, and analogous state laws. For example, federal agencies granting permits for Renewables’ projects consider the impact on endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the ESA, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for harming endangered or threatened species and their habitats. Renewables’ projects also need to consider the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, or MBTA, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, or BGEPA, which protect migratory birds and bald and golden eagles and are administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Criminal liability can result from violations of the MBTA and the BGEPA. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has previously enforced substantial penalties and mitigation measures against two large wind farm operators, pursuant to which those operators pled guilty to criminal violations of the MBTA.
In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines for onshore wind projects established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or USFWS, set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the United States while also protecting both birds and bats and their habitats. These guidelines include provisions for specific monitoring and study conditions which need to be met in order for projects to be in adherence with these voluntary guidelines. Most states also have similar laws. Because the operation of wind turbines may result in injury or fatalities to birds and bats, federal and state agencies often recommend or require that Renewables conduct avian and bat risk assessments prior to issuing permits for its projects. They may also require ongoing monitoring or mitigation activities as a condition to approving a project.
Similarly, BOEM has established survey guidelines for renewable energy development, including avian surveys in coordination with the USFWS. BOEM will use the data from the offshore marine surveys to evaluate the impacts of construction, installation and operation of meteorological towers, buoys, export and inter-array cables, wind turbine generators and supporting structures on physical, biological, and socioeconomic resources, as well as the seafloor and sub-seafloor conditions. The information will be used by BOEM, other federal agencies and potentially affected states in the preparation of National Environmental Policy Act documents, for consultations and other regulatory requirements.
Global Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues
Global climate change and greenhouse gas emission issues continue to receive an increased focus from state governments and the federal government. In November 2010, the EPA published final rules for monitoring and reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases under the authority of the Clean Air Act 
beginning in 2011. These regulations apply to facilities that emit greenhouse gases above the threshold level of 25,000 metric tons equivalent per year. SCG and CNG both exceed this threshold and are subject to reporting requirements. The liquefied natural gas, or LNG, facilities owned and/or contracted by SCG and CNG are also subject to the monitoring and reporting requirements under the regulations. Similarly, Networks is subject to reporting requirements under provisions of the greenhouse gases regulations, which regulate electric transmission and distribution equipment that emit sulfur hexafluoride.
We are continuously evaluating the regulatory risks and regulatory uncertainty presented by climate change and greenhouse gas emission. Such concerns could potentially lead to additional rules and regulations as well as requirements imposed through the ratemaking process that impact how we operate our business. We expect that any of Networks' costs for these rules, regulations and requirements would be recovered from customers.
OSHA and Certain Other Federal Safety Laws
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard and standards administered by other federal as well as state agencies, including the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and the related implementing regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations of our subsidiaries and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Management, Disposal and Remediation of Hazardous Substances
We own or lease real property and may be subject to federal, state and local requirements regarding the storage, use, transportation and disposal of petroleum products and toxic or hazardous substances, including spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements. Project properties and materials stored or disposed thereon may be subject to the federal RCRA, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state laws. If any of our owned or leased properties are contaminated, whether during or prior to our ownership or operation, we could be responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup and for any related liabilities, including claims for damage to property, persons or natural resources. Such responsibility may arise even if we were not at fault and did not cause the contamination. In addition, waste generated by our operating subsidiaries is at times sent to third party disposal facilities. If such facilities become contaminated, the operating subsidiary and any other persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at those sites may be jointly and severally responsible for the costs of investigation and remediation, as well as for any claims of damages to third parties, their property or natural resources.
In August 2016, a partial consent order was issued by DEEP related to the investigation and remediation of the English Station site. The consent order requires UI to investigate and remediate certain environmental conditions within the perimeter of the English Station site. Under the consent order, to the extent that the cost of this investigation and remediation is less than $30 million, UI is required to remit to the State of Connecticut the difference between such cost and $30 million to be applied to a public purpose as determined in the discretion of the Governor of the State of Connecticut, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut and the Commissioner of DEEP. However, UI is obligated to comply with the consent order even if the cost of such compliance exceeds $30 million. The state may discuss options with UI on recovering or funding any cost above $30 million, such as through public funding or recovery from third parties, however it is not bound to agree to or support any means of recovery or funding. UI has initiated its process to investigate and remediate the environmental conditions within the perimeter of the English Station site pursuant to the consent order.

Customers
Networks delivers natural gas and electricity to residential, commercial and institutional customers through its regulated utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Networks’ customer payment terms are regulated by the states of New York, with respect to NYSEG and RG&E; Maine, with respect to CMP and MNG; Connecticut, with respect to UI, SCG and CNG; and Massachusetts, with respect to BGC, and each of the regulated utilities must provide extended payment arrangements to customers for past due balances. See “—Networks” for more information relating to the customers of Networks.
Renewables sells the majority of its output to large investor-owned utilities, public utilities and other credit-worthy entities. Additionally, Renewables generates and provides power, among other services, to federal and state agencies, institutional retail and joint action agencies. Offtakers typically purchase renewable energy from Renewables through long-term PPAs, allowing Renewables to limit its exposure to market volatility. Approximately 67% of Renewables’ wind 
generating capacity is fully committed under PPAs as of December 31, 2020, with an average duration of 9.0 years. Renewables also delivers thermal output to wholesale customers in the Western United States.
Competition
Networks’ regulated utilities do not generally face competition from other companies that transmit and distribute electricity and natural gas. However, demand for electricity and natural gas may be negatively impacted by federal and state legislation mandating that certain percentages of power delivered to end users be produced from renewable resources, such as wind, thermal and solar energy.
Networks faces competition from self-contained micro-grids that integrate renewable energy sources in the areas served by Networks. However, there has been limited development of these micro-grids in Networks’ service areas to date, and Networks expects that growth in distributed generation of renewable energy will continue due to financial incentives being provided by federal and state legislation.
Renewables has competitive advantages, including a robust development pipeline, a management team with extensive experience, strong relationships with suppliers and clients, expert regulatory knowledge and brand awareness. However, Renewables faces competition throughout the life cycles of its energy facilities, including during the development phase, in the identification and procurement of suitable sites with high wind resource availability, grid connection capacity and land availability. Renewables also competes with other suppliers in securing long-term PPAs with power purchasers and participates in competitive bilateral and organized energy markets with other energy sources for power that is not sold under PPAs. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies.

Infrastructure Protection and Cyber Security Measures
We have risk-based security measures in place designed to protect our facilities, assets and cyber-infrastructure, such as our transmission and distribution system.
While we have not had any significant security breaches, a physical security intrusion could potentially lead to theft and the release of critical operating information. In addition to physical security intrusions, a cyber breach could potentially lead to theft and the release of critical operating information or confidential customer information.
To manage these operational risks, pursuant to the cybersecurity risk policy and corporate security policy approved by the AVANGRID board, we have implemented cyber and physical security measures and continue to strengthen our security posture by improving and expanding our physical and cyber security capabilities to protect critical assets.
In an effort to reduce our vulnerability to cyber-attacks, the AVANGRID board appointed a senior officer responsible for security (chief security officer) and we have established a dedicated corporate security office, responsible for improving and coordinating security across the company, who regularly reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee of the AVANGRID board on security matters. We have adopted a comprehensive company-wide physical and cyber security program, which is supported by a governance program to manage, oversee and assist us in meeting our corporate, legal and regulatory responsibilities with regard to the protection of our cyber, physical and information assets.
However, as threats evolve and grow increasingly more sophisticated, we cannot ensure that a potential security breach may not occur or quantify the potential impact of such an event. We continue to invest in technology, processes, security measures and services to predict, detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber. These investments include upgrades to our cyber-infrastructure assets, network architecture and physical security measures, and compliance with emerging industry best practice and regulation. See the risk factor “Security breaches, acts of war or terrorism, grid disturbances or unauthorized access could negatively impact our business, financial condition and reputation” under Item 1A - Risk Factors. 
Human Capital Resources
Our industry – like our world – is ever-changing, from the pace of innovation to the priorities of our workforce and stakeholders. Our vision is to be a destination where talented and committed people want to build long-term careers. We support a culture that emphasizes continuous improvement and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo and drive performance. We believe innovation thrives within a healthy and sustainable employee community full of diverse perspectives, which results in better ideas, better products and better service.
To meet the challenges of the future, we are dependent on each of us being safe, empowered, and enabled to bring our unique perspectives and personal best to the workplace every day.
As a purpose-driven organization, we believe sustainable growth requires a diverse and inclusive workplace built on individual accountability and commitment to serving others. We are continuing to invest in initiatives that unleash individual potential, value and reward performance, champion well-being, and foster meaningful connections between each another and the communities we serve.
Demographics
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 7,031 full-time employees, with approximately 49% of our employees represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Virtually all of our employees are full-time. During fiscal year 2020, we hired and onboarded 907 employees. Our voluntary turnover rate was 3.6% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DE&I, is a business imperative for us, as we believe that it is key to our future success. We strive to build and sustain a diverse workforce with a rich mix of differences, inclusive workplaces where each of us feel valued and connected, with equitable opportunities to grow and develop - no matter where we work. We have focused our DE&I initiatives on increasing diverse representation especially in positions of authority, removing barriers, promoting equitable opportunities to grow and develop and building community by establishing tangible pathways for connection with others inside and outside AVANGRID.
During 2020, AVANGRID became a member of the Paradigm for Parity coalition, which is comprised of business leaders, board members and academics committed to addressing the corporate leadership gender gap, and the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, a CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in workplace. These public initiatives bring business leaders together to commit to specific goals within the workplace – from gender parity to a willingness to have challenging conversations at work. We also established a DE&I Council made up of executive and Business Resource Group leaders to provide steerage and support of our DE&I strategy. We also expanded our Business Resource Groups, adding Pride@ AVANGRID, the AVANGRID African American Council for Excellence (AAACE) and the Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Awareness (¡Hola!). Our Management Committee and their direct reports also engaged in workshops about race and racism facilitated by external training resources. As of December 31, 2020, the approximate demographic breakdowns of our workforce are as follows:

Health and Safety
Safety is a core value of AVANGRID. Providing a safe and healthy workplace is our commitment to our employees, communities, customers and investors. Daily emphasis on the importance of a safe workplace – and everyone’s role in supporting it – builds employee confidence, motivation and productivity. A safe workplace encourages an environment where creativity and innovation can flourish. 
AVANGRID continuously works to embed a safety culture initiative across the company. In addition to the ongoing safety training and awareness programs, we use Safety Excellence Awards and the Spot Recognition Program to recognize exemplary and proactive safety behavior. These programs build critical skills for managers and supervisors to instill and boost engagement with a learning and improving culture for all employees.
A true culture of health and safety is dependent on not only a strong safety program, but also a program that focuses on employee well-being. Healthier employees are at lower risk of injury from industrial exposure and perform work more safely with lower rates of absenteeism. AVANGRID’s Health and Well-being program focuses on the physical, emotional, social and financial health of our employees. We provide a wellness portal that all employees and family members can access on their phones to manage their health and wellbeing and participate in activity challenges and other wellbeing activities. We also 
provided onsite prevention and risk reduction programs, such as biometric screenings and flu shots. Our employees’ financial health is equally important so we have developed programs for financial education and advisory services.
During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, AVANGRID formed a cross-functional COVID-19 Crisis Management Team that has been leading and coordinating AVANGRID’s overall response. This team leads efforts to develop and monitor mitigation and business continuity plans; track all relevant state and local government guidelines, directives and regulations; develop and adopt work-from-home plans where possible; implement safe working protocols; assess appropriate return-to-office protocols; and provide timely and transparent communications to key stakeholders. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, AVANGRID provided benefits to its employees to cover the cost of COVID-19 testing, promoted its telehealth benefits, expanded its employee assistance and well-being plans and provided supplemental paid leave for quarantined employees.
Engaging our talent
In 2020, AVANGRID continued its dialogue with employees on their ideas about areas of organizational strength and opportunities to improve our culture and work environment. To understand the employee feedback in response to "The Loop" survey, our annual employee engagement survey, AVANGRID identified engagement leads who were responsible for promoting survey awareness and participation, as well as assisting broader groups of managers and business leaders in the analysis of survey data and in planning specific actions to address the opportunity areas with employees. Action plans were created at both the department and organization levels, and commitments were shared broadly so that employees would know how their feedback was being acted upon and understood. While this is an ongoing effort and there is more to be done, employee engagement increased 9% over the previous year.
Growing our talent
We invest in developing the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make AVANGRID a destination where talented and committed people want to build long-term careers. We encourage the personal and professional development of our employees through leadership preparation and high potential programs, technical and on-the-job training and learning and education opportunities. 
Our employees provide the energy and innovation that drive AVANGRID. That is why it is a priority to attract and develop a highly engaged workforce with quality training and development resources. During 2020, we developed leadership succession and talent management plans to help grow and develop our internal talent to meet future needs, while continuing to develop first-class early career programs to help secure the right people in the right roles with the right skills for a sustainability business. We also deployed modern training and development solutions that leverage new technologies to help fuel our employees’ desire to grow and meet the needs of our customers, while enacting leadership and professional development solutions to help enhance skills and capability now and in the future. 
Compensation and benefits
AVANGRID’s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with AVANGRID’s performance and are designed to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances competitive fixed compensation and variable pay to reward performance by: 
•Providing base pay that is consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. 
•Evaluating the effectiveness and competitiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and benchmarking ourselves against our peers within our industry. 
•All employees being eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leave, retirement savings plans and life and disability plans.
•Offering a comprehensive set of benefits that allow employees to choose programs that meet their individual needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, adoption assistance, back-up child/elder care, and physical, mental and financial wellness programs.
