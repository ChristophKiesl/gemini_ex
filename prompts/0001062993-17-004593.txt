ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverview of Our Business 
 We are an integrated food manufacturing company headquartered in Shandong Province, China. We develop, manufacture and sell the following types of food products: 
 
 | Chestnut products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Convenience foods (including ready-to-cook, or RTC, foods, ready-to-eat, or RTE, foods; and 
 | Frozen food products. 

 We conduct our production activities in China. Our products are sold in Chinese domestic markets as well as exported to foreign countries and regions such as Japan, South Korea and Europe. We derive most of our revenues from sales in China, Japan and South Korea. In 2017, our primary strategy is to continue building our brand recognition in China through consistent marketing efforts towards supermarkets, wholesalers, and significant customers, enhancing the cooperation with other manufacturers and factories and enhancing the turnover for our existing chestnut, convenience and frozen food products. In addition, we are working to develop new products and new sales channels. We currently have limited sales and marketing activity in the United States, although our long-term plan is to significantly expand our activities there. 
 Recent Developments
The Company has discovered errors in the timing of revenues recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipping of products to its customers where title of the goods passes upon departure from the Company’s facilities; however, in certain instances, contractual terms dictate that the customers are afforded seven days after the receipt of goods at their premises to inspect the goods for defects or spoilage and notify the Company. If the Company is not contacted within those seven days, the Company’s obligation to the customer are considered fully discharged and revenue should be recognized. Given the timing of these seven days, the Company believes that certain sales transactions have been erroneously recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company has rectified this error and the impact of the Company’s financial position and result of operations
 On December 22, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Shengrong Environmental Protection Holding Company Limited, a business company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with limited liability (Shengrong), and each of Shengrongs shareholders (collectively, the Sellers), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company agreed to effect an acquisition of Shengrong and its subsidiaries, including Hubei Shengrong Environmental Protection Energy-Saving and Technology Co. Ltd., a registered company in Hubei China by acquiring from the Sellers all outstanding equity interests of Shengrong. However, such agreement was terminated and abandoned in June 2017. 
 Revenues from sales in the China domestic market decreased by approximately $79.2 million, or approximately 46.05%, in 2016. The reasons for the decrease in revenues in China decreased are: 
 
o | Shandong Lorain was required to move its production lines to our factory in Junan Hongrun according to a new city zoning plan, so that Shandong Lorains land can be used for other urban use. Shandong Lorain started this relocation process in July 2016 and finished this process in December 2016. During the relocation process, we were unable to produce our products with full capacity. As a result, the revenue from sales of chestnuts food products by Shandong Lorain was $30.4 million and $54.3 million in 2016 and in 2015, respectively, decreasing by approximately 44%. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | The domestic sale of our chestnuts has decreased due to increased prices of chestnut in Luotian, Hubei, our main chestnut supply region, because of flooding. As a result, the sales revenue of Luotian Lorain was deceased by 44.9% in 2016. 

 We liquidated our French operations in 2016 following an investigation with respect to the origin of canned chestnuts sold by Conserverie Minerve (Minerve, a former subsidiary of Athena) issued Centre Technique Conservation of Produits Agricoles (CTCPA), an industry trade association for canned, preserved and dehydrated food products in France. CTCPA stated that only chestnuts based on the European or Japanese cultivars can be used in canned chestnut products sold in France according to CTCPA policies and that canned chestnut products must also have received certification from the International Featured Standards (IFS), a qualified third party certification agency in Europe that certifies food products, especially for retail industry.

As a result of such liquidation, our exports have decreased substantially due to weak demand in the international market. Revenue from sales in international markets decreased by approximately $29.1 million, or approximately 67.12% . We mainly relied on Athena, our French subsidiary, to sell our products in European market. But since we suffered a significant loss from the result of investigation of CTCPA during 2015 and 2016, we decided to shut down the operation of Athena. As a result, the export amount of chestnuts to Europe markets decreased markedly by 95.40% in 2016. 
 Revenues from sales of convenience food decreased by approximately 65.0% in 2016 due to increasing market competition. Since 2015, more competitors entered the convenience food industry that develop more types of products. Our current products have not met customers demand in the most recent year due to our failure to invest in research and development. In addition, we have faced significant competition from Chinese online ordering platforms since 2015, which platforms offer convenient and efficient meals directly from restaurants. In addition, Dongguan Lorain ceased operations in October 2016 due to its high cost of environmental compliance, the overlap of products and market with Luotian Lorain, both of which focus on the southern market of China, and poor performance of sales revenue. 
 Revenues from sales of our frozen food products decreased by 10.9% compared with that in 2015. The decrease is mainly due to the fact that the sales amount declined, because of the relocation of Shandong Lorain, one of our frozen food producing and sales company, discussed above. 
 Our general and administrative expenses increased approximately $35.1 million, or 620.0%, to $ 40.8 million in 2016 from $5.7 million in 2015. The increase mainly due to the bad debt including $35,590,795 unrecovered trade receivables and other receivables that management determined cannot be recovered, which accounted for 87.2% of total general and administrative expenses in 2016, respectively. In 2016, the credit terms for many of our domestic customers was between 30 and 60 days; international customers are typically extended 90 days credit. Our cash flow suffered while waiting for such payments. Many of our direct clients, such as supermarkets and restaurants, did not make payments promptly due to poor sales. In addition, third party distributors ability to collect accounts receivable was worsened due to the bad sales performance and such distributors inability to collect receivables from their own clients. Other receivables that become bad debt include (i) raw materials we paid for but the suppliers did not provide the raw materials ordered by us and refused to refund the advance payment, or we did not agree on the quality of the raw materials and (ii) advance payments made by our procurement department for raw materials, and such salesmen left the company before we could confirm that the goods had been warehoused. Most of the aforementioned receivables were incurred after 2014, and under accounting principles we determined that 2016 was a suitable time to increase the ratio of provision for bad debts exceeding half a year to 50% and to 100% for over one year.
 Organizational Structure 
 ALN is a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on February 4, 1986 and was formerly known as Millennium Quest, Inc. Effective November 12, 2009, ALN reincorporated in Nevada from Delaware. 
 ALN owns 100% of ILH. ILH wholly owns two Chinese operating subsidiaries, Luotian Lorain and Junan Hongrun, directly. Junan Hongrun, in turn, owns 100% and 51% of Dongguan Lorain and Athena respectively. In addition, together with Junan Hongrun, ILH wholly owns Beijing Lorain, Shandong Greenpia, and owns approximately 80% of Shandong Lorain (Shandong Economic Development Investment Co. Ltd. owns approximately 20%). We sometimes refer to our six Chinese operating subsidiaries and the Athena Group throughout this annual report on Form 10-K as the Lorain Group Companies. Below is an organizational chart of ALN, ILH and the Lorain Group Companies:

* Athena is a holding company which holds majority of the capital and the voting shares of Conserverie Minerve, a company organized under French law. Conserverie Minerve specializes in the processing and sale of chestnut and prepared foods products in Europe. Conserverie Minerve operates its businesses through the following, direct and indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries: 
 
 | Sojafrais, a company organized under French law; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | SCI SIAM, a real estate company organized under French law; 
 | SCI GIU LONG, a real estate company organized under French law; and 
 | CACOVIN, a company organized under Portuguese law. 

 On June 6, 2015, Athena approved the merger of its wholly owned subsidiary Conserverie Minerve into Athena. Athena assumed all contracts, rights, assets and liabilities of Conserverie Minerve after the merger. Athena was a holding company with no operations and its only asset was the equity of Conserverie Minerve. On August 8, 2015, the merger was completed. In April 2016, Athena ceased operations as discussed above.
Products 
 Our products are categorized into the following three segments: 
 
 | Chestnut products, 
--+-------------------------------
 | Convenience food products, and
 | Frozen food products. 

 We produced 214 products in 2016, including 1 new product in frozen food products. We also discontinued 25 products in 2016 in the convenience a foods products.

Chestnut Products 
 We have developed brand equity for our chestnut products in China, Japan and South Korea over the past 18 years. We produced 60 high value-added processed chestnut products in 2016. In 2016 and 2015, this segment contributed 57% and 53.6% of our total revenues, respectively. 
 Our best selling products in 2016 included our frozen chestnuts. The majority of our chestnut products are natural and do not contain chemical additives. 
 The chestnut, in contrast to many other tree nuts, contains small quantities of oil and is very high in complex carbohydrates. This makes them useful for a wider food range than other common nuts. Chestnuts are commonly steamed, boiled, sugar stir-fried, roasted or added into dishes or desserts as an ingredient. 
 We position our chestnut products as middle to high end products. We differentiate our chestnut products based on production process, high quality raw materials inputs, flavor, size and method of packaging. For instance, some of our chestnut products that are sold in Japan are packaged in plastic bags or tin cans, each considered a different product. Similarly, some of our chestnut products are processed with hot water or cold water, each considered a different product. 
 Chestnut season in China lasts from September to January. We purchase and produce raw chestnuts during these months and store them in our refrigerated storage facilities throughout the year. Once we obtain a purchase order during the rest of the year, we remove the chestnuts from storage, process them and ship them within one day of production. 
 Convenience Foods
Our convenience food products are characterized as follows: 
 
 | Ready-to-cook, or RTC, food products, 
--+-----------------------------------------
 | Ready-to-eat, or RTE, food products, and

 These products are intended to meet the current demands of our customers for safe, wholesome and tasty foods that are easily prepared. 
 RTCs can be served after a few easy cooking procedures. Typically, when preparing a RTC, customers need only to heat the food in a microwave or boil it for several minutes before eating. Our best-selling RTCs in 2016 were French fries. 
 RTEs can be served without any cooking. Our best-selling RTEs in 2016 were various bean products and various fried vegetables. 
 We produced 92 convenience food products in 2016. In 2016 and 2015, this segment contributed 20.3% and 25.3%, respectively, of our total revenues. 
 Frozen Food Products
We produce a variety of frozen foods, mostly frozen vegetables and frozen fruits. We produced 62 frozen food products in 2016. Our best-selling frozen food products in 2016 was sweet corn products. 
 Our frozen food business allows us to mitigate the significant production seasonality of chestnut products and to increase the utilization rate of our production capacity. Through our sales network, we are seeking to further penetrate into domestic and overseas market for our frozen food segment as it may not only raise our spare production capacity without additional heavy capital investment, but also boost our brand equity as we are selected to be the provider for international fast food giants. The frozen foods accounted for in our total revenue increased from 21.0% in 2016 to 22.7% in 2015. Gross margins in this segment are lower than the margins for chestnut products and convenience foods.

Our Manufacturing Facilities
General
We currently manufacture our products in four facilities in China, two of which are located in Junan County, Shandong Province, one in Luotian County, Hubei Province, and one in Miyun County, Beijing. As described above, in 2016, we ceased operations in France, Dongguang and Shandong. 
 The following table indicates the year that operations commenced at each of the facilities and the size of the facilities. 
 
 | Year Operations Facility Size 
------------------+------------------------------------
Facility | Commenced | (square meters)
Junan Hongrun | 2002 | 38,865 
Beijing Lorain | 2003 | 21,000 
Luotian Lorain | 2003 | 9,558 
Shandong Greenpia | 2010 | 9,179 

 Production Lines
We currently manufacture our products using 29 production lines. Except Chinese doughnuts production lines, each production line is used to produce between 10 and 50 products. We currently run four types of product lines: 

 | Deep-freezing lines, which are used to freeze raw materials for year-round production and to produce frozen food; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Canning lines, which are used to produce canned products, including chestnut products; 
 | Convenience food lines, which are used for producing RTCs and RTEs, all of which have nitrogen preservation capacity; and 
 | Chinese doughnuts lines, which are used to produce Chinese doughnut products. 

 The production process for our chestnut products initially involves sorting and cleaning the raw chestnuts purchased during the chestnut season. We then store the raw chestnuts in our refrigerated storage facilities throughout the year. Once we obtain a purchase order, we remove the chestnuts from storage and process them by steaming, decladding and deep-freezing the chestnuts, depending on the particular product. We then package and ship the processed chestnuts within one day of production. 
 The production process of our convenience products generally involves various steps, including soaking, boiling, coating, drying, deep freezing, packing, sealing and sterilizing. 
 The following table shows the number and types of production lines, the types of products produced and the production capacity at each facility: 
 
Facilities | Production Lines | Product Portfolio | 2016 Capacity 
------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Junan Hongrun | 3 Deep-freezing line 4 Convenience food lines 4 Canning lines 4 Chinese doughnut lines | Chestnut products, frozen foods, beans, bean paste | Multi-purpose production lines with 74,000 tons of production capacity Chinese doughnut lines with 2000 tons production capacity 24,900 tons of cold and frozen storage 
Beijing Lorain | 6 Convenience food lines 1 Deep-freezing line | Chestnut products, frozen foods | Multi-purpose production lines with 34,000 tons of production capacity 4,650 tons of cold and frozen storage 
Luotian Lorain | 3 Convenience food lines 2 Deep-freezing lines | Chestnut products, convenience foods, frozen foods | Multi-purpose production lines with 24,000 tons of production capacity 6,500 tons of cold and frozen storage 
Shandong Greenpia | 2 Convenience food lines | Chestnut products, convenience foods | Multi-purpose production lines with 9,000 tons of production capacity 1,500 tons of cold and frozen storage

* Shandong Lorain relocated its convenience food product line, completed in December 2016, to Junan Hongrun due to the local government land seizures requirement. 

 We allocate our production lines based upon the location of our facilities to take advantage of efficiencies in the transportation of required raw materials. For example, Junan Hongrun and Shandong Lorain, which manufacture primarily chestnut and frozen products, are located in Shandong Province, which is Chinas largest supplier of fresh products by volume. Shandong Province is also a major chestnut producing region. 
 Our production lines and facilities have all been designed to meet the standards and requirements of our largest customers in South Korea and Japan, with Japan being our top overseas markets in value term. 

 We employ advanced methods of quality control and have obtained various certifications for many of our products, packages and processes, including ISO 9000 or ISO 9001 certification for certain of our chestnut and frozen vegetable products, BRC certification for certain of our frozen fruit and vegetable products and HACCP certification for certain of our frozen vegetable, fruit and chestnut products and our bottom-open chestnuts. We believe that our quality controls and standards of products distinguish us from other manufacturers in both domestic and international markets. 
 With limited exception, we operate our production lines year round. In the past, when our production was focused almost exclusively on chestnuts, we experienced seasonal underutilization of our product lines. However, our current facilities have multiple-function designs allowing us to use our production lines for our convenience and frozen products when we are not producing chestnuts at full capacity. Consequently, as we have increased our processed and convenience food offerings over the last several years, we have generally been able to run our production lines at increasing efficiency. 
 We believe our facilities are adequate for our current levels of production. We anticipate, however, that we may require additional facilities and/or product lines as our business grows. We are exploring the possibility of alliances with one or more OEM partners for the production, in the short-term, of some of our convenience food products and frozen products should our facilities be inadequate to meet increasing demand. We are also exploring the possibility of leasing additional production lines to expand our production capacity. We did not lease any production facility during 2016. We may decide to lease additional facilities in 2017, should circumstances require and subject to acceptable costing. In the long-term, we plan to increase our own production capacity by acquiring or building new facilities, subject to the availability of adequate sources of funding. 
 Storage Capacity
Storage of our raw materials and inventory is a critical element of our business. Our raw materials and partially finished products need to be preserved in frozen storages (-18ºC to -20ºC) or constant temperature storages (-5ºC to 5ºC). Storage is particularly critical for our chestnut products because chestnuts are a seasonal fruit. 
 The following table illustrates on a facility by facility basis the type and capacity of our storage resources: 
 
 | | Number of | Capacity 
------------------+----------------------+---------------+--------------
Facility | Storage Type | Storage Units | (metric tons)
Junan Hongrun | Frozen Storage | 19 | 20,100 
 | Constant Temperature | 11 | 5,300 
Beijing Lorain | Frozen Storage | 6 | 2,850 
 | Constant Temperature | 3 | 1,800 
Luotian Lorain | Frozen Storage | 8 | 4,500 
 | Constant Temperature | 4 | 2,000 
Shandong Greenpia | Constant Temperature | 4 | 1,500 
TOTAL | | 60 | 41,050 

 * Shandong Lorain move its convenience food product line, completed in December 2016, to Junan Hongrun due to the local government land seizures requirement. 
 All of the listed storage facilities are owned by us. We did not add to our storage capacity during 2016.

Agricultural Operations
We grow or set up agricultural co-ops with local farmers to supply ourselves with a small portion of chestnut, fruit and vegetable products. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the supplies coming from agricultural operations is still a low proportion of the total. We believe that we will continue to develop more agricultural facilities in the long-term. We anticipate that self-grown agricultural products and agricultural products grown in cooperation with local farmers will enable us to assure adequacy of supply, promote quality and reduce cost, particularly for our high margin offerings. For example, by growing Korean cultivar chestnuts domestically, we expect to significantly reduce our supply costs for this premium product, while ensuring superior quality. 
 Lands in which we grow our agricultural products for such products are shown in the following table. 
 
 | Area | Location
-------------------------------------------------------------+---------+---------
Harvest | (acres) | (PRC) 
Chestnut (South Korean, Japanese, Australian cultivar) | 1,052 | Shandong

 We began growing chestnuts in Shandong Province in 2003. Unlike most vegetables and fruits, chestnut trees have a 3-5 year growing phase before they can be harvested. Our current chestnut planting base has been self-supplying limited quantities of chestnuts to our production since 2007. In the end of 2016, we leased two woods in Junan County Shandong Province, China to plant more chestnuts trees, which we expect will expand the production of our self-supplied chestnuts in a near future. However, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in that regard. 
 We began growing strawberries in 2008 in Shandong and peaches, apricots, pears and blackberries in 2009 in Beijing. We use these fruits in some of our frozen fruit products. 
 We plan to continue to expand our agricultural operations over the next a few years. Among other things, we plan to increase our self-production in China of Korean cultivar chestnuts. We expect to obtain funding for this expansion through a combination of commercial and government loans, including loans under Chinese government programs to promote agricultural industrialization. There is no assurance, however, that adequate funding for these purposes will be available to us. 
 Raw Materials 
 In 2015 and 2016, approximately 78% and 85% of our procured raw materials, respectively, consisted of agricultural products, including primarily chestnuts and vegetables, approximately 7% and 6%, respectively, consisted of packaging materials and approximately 15% and 9% consisted of condiments such as sugar, salt and flour. 
 Our Supply Sources
Our business depends on obtaining a reliable supply of various agricultural products, including chestnuts, vegetables, red meat, fish, eggs, rice and flour. Because of the diversity of available sources of these raw materials, we believe that our raw materials are currently in adequate supply and will continue to be so in the future. 
 9

We obtain our agricultural raw materials from three sources: domestic procurement (excluding self-supply), overseas markets, and self-supply. Domestic and overseas procurement accounted for 91% and 6.8%, respectively, of our total raw material costs in 2016, while self-supply accounted for 2.2% . We obtained substantially all of our agricultural raw materials from domestic sources during 2016. 
 In 2016 and 2015, respectively, we procured approximately 31,892 and 44,383 metric tons of chestnuts and approximately 32,487 and 53,106 metric tons of vegetables and other raw materials from a number of third party suppliers, domestic and overseas, and produced approximately 438 and 568 metric tons of chestnuts and other products from our own agricultural operations. 
 We select suppliers based on price and product quality. We typically rely on numerous domestic and international suppliers, including some with whom we have a long-term relationship. Our top 10 suppliers accounted for 13.4% and 13.6% of the total procurement in 2015 and 2016 in value terms respectively. We purchase from suppliers and farmers pursuant to supply contracts and underlying purchase orders. We have not entered into any long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. 
 Our suppliers generally include wholesale agricultural product companies, agricultural associations and distributors. Some raw materials must be imported at higher costs, however. Occasionally, we also work directly with farmers. For instance, we operate an initiative which involves a series of cooperation and lease agreements between Shandong Lorain, Beijing Lorain and local farmers. This initiative involves approximately 1,000 acres of land which is used primarily to produce Japanese and Korean style chestnuts, sticky corn and pumpkins for our operations. 
 Procurement Cost and Quality Control 
 To control procurement costs, we have built our facilities near domestic sources of agricultural raw materials. For example, Junan Hongrun and Shandong Lorain are located in Shandong Province, which is Chinas largest supplier of fresh products by volume. Shandong Province is also a major chestnut producing region. Local procurement reduces our costs, especially transportation costs. It also gives us first-hand harvest and market information, which provides us with an advantage in price negotiations with suppliers. 
 Some raw materials must be imported at higher cost. As discussed, we have begun to develop our agricultural capabilities in order to control costs, particularly with respect to imported raw materials such as Korean-style chestnuts. 
 Pricing for agricultural products reflects several external factors, such as weather conditions and commodity market fluctuations, which are beyond our control. We obtain contemporaneous information on local harvests and collect daily reported price information on harvests in other markets from which we procure our products. We also attempt to predict harvest yields in advance based on our information gathering. We use this harvest information to negotiate best pricing with our suppliers. 
 We impose strict standards on our suppliers. During the harvest season, our internal procurement function personnel may visit our sources of supply to assure that the products we are purchasing comply with our standards. 
 Our Customers 
 Our products are sold in Chinese domestic markets as well as exported to foreign countries and regions such as Japan and South Korea. In 2015 and 2016, approximately 80.1% and 82.1%, respectively of our sales were made domestically in China and approximately 19.9% and 17.9% were to international customers, primarily Japan and South Korea. Our top ten customers contributed 12.3% and 12.1% of our total revenues in 2015 and 2016 respectively. 
 Domestic
In China, we sell our products through our own sales team and through third-party distributors. We have 26 sales offices in 31 provinces in China. In 2015 and 2016, we sold approximately 60.0% and 72.6%, respectively, of our products directly to our Chinese and overseas customers and approximately 40.0% and 27.4% through third-party distributors. In view of a significant decline in our sales volume in 2016, we decided to cut spending. By comparison, the performance of our third-party distributors is far from expected, and our direct-selling business is the main source of revenue. In addition, due to the low demand of the market, the third-party distributors need less the products, which result that our relationship not as close as the previous years, leading to the increase of bad debts. Therefore, we decided to reduce the proportion of third-party distributors and enhance our own sales team. 
 10

We sell our products in all first-tier cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou. Our sales team sells our products directly to supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, large wholesalers and others in these markets. In second-tier and third-tier cities, we currently sell our products to third-party distributors, such as food companies or trading companies with established distribution channels in such regions, rather than through our own sales team, in order to enable us to penetrate such markets more quickly without spending significant capital. We also sell to small customers through independent sales representatives. 
 The terms of a typical sales contract between us and our distributors provide that we are responsible for transportation costs and the distributors are responsible for storage costs. Furthermore, the distributors have the right to return products that fail to satisfy specified quality standards, at our cost. The majority of such contracts require the distributors to pay us in cash in full upon delivery, and the remaining contracts provide for short-term credit, usually two to three weeks. In addition, we typically offer distributors performance-based incentives, such as a cash bonus equal to 1% to 1.5% of total revenues generated by such distributor which exceed previously established sales targets. 
 International
Our export sales destinations include: 

 
 | Asia pacific, primarily Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, but also Singapore, Philippines, and Australia; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Europe, primarily France and Portugal, but also Belgium; 
 | the Middle East, primarily Israel; 
 | North America, including the United States 

 Outside China, sales in Europe decreased by 95.4% in 2016 as a result of a bad sales performance in France and Portugal and the shutdown of Athena Group. Sales in Asia countries also decreased by 19.2% due to weak demand in Asia countries. 
 We sell our products to international markets primarily through export and trading agents and companies in China, as well as our own sales team located in China and Japan. Our sales team sells directly to wholesalers, food processors and mass merchandisers. Many of our customers are well known in their local food market. We have established long-term relationships with many international customers, especially in Japan and South Korea. 
 Our Sales and Marketing Efforts
We seek to expand our customer base by: 
 
 | Direct sales communications with our large customers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Sales through distributors to new customer bases; 
 | Referrals from existing customers; and 
 | Participation in domestic and international food exhibitions and trade conferences. 

 We have not spent a significant amount of capital on advertising in the past, and our advertising budget continues to be limited. In 2016 our marketing and branding efforts included supermarket advertising and internet advertising. 
 We intend to increase our advertising and branding efforts given the consumer nature for many of our products. For the near future, our marketing efforts will continue to focus primarily on the domestic Chinese, Japan and South Korea markets for our chestnut and convenience food products. 
 Competition and Market Position 
 The overall food market is diverse, both globally and in China. We do not have a significant market share in any of our business segments. 
 Chestnut Products
We compete in the chestnut market primarily on the basis of the uniqueness of our products, quality, price and brand recognition. We also utilize our proprietary, patented and patent-pending technology in the production of our chestnut products to our competitive advantage. 
 11

The world market for chestnut products is highly fragmented. Our principal competitors in the chestnut product market are currently Hebei Liyuan, a Chinese company, and Foodwell Corporation, a South Korean company and Concept Fruit, a European company. 
 Convenience Food Products
The market competition for convenience food products is based mostly upon quality and product variety. We attempt to use our modern food processing technology, such as nitrogen preservation, to produce a wide variety of high quality convenience foods. 
 The convenience food market in China is highly fragmented and we do not face competitive pressure from any particular competitor or small group of competitors. 
 Frozen Food Products
In the frozen food product market, competition is based primarily upon quality, ability to provide a reliable product supply and customer relationships. 
 Our strongest competitors in the frozen food products market are currently Beijing Liliangzi Food Co. Ltd., Hangzhou Dadi Food Co. Ltd. and Tianjin Jinkaili Food Co. Ltd., all of which are located in China. 
Competitive Advantages 
 We believe that we enjoy a number of competitive advantages, both domestically and internationally. 
 We have developed brand equity for our chestnut products in China, Japan and South Korea over the past 18 years. Our customers are willing to pay a premium for some of our chestnut products because of our brand equity. In addition, we believe that we have a strong distribution channel for our products in the markets in which we currently operate. 
 We believe that we are able to provide our customers with greater selection and a more reliable supply than many of our competitors, which is especially important for our supermarket chain and large wholesaler customers. We produced 60 chestnut products in 2016. We believe that we are the only provider of certain bottom-open chestnut and sweetheart chestnut products in China. 
 Labor is a large portion of total operating costs for food companies. We believe that we have a lower labor cost structure and a more abundant labor supply than many of our international competitors. 
 We are focused on managing our costs in other ways as well. We seek to locate our production facilities in close proximity to our main domestic sources of raw material supply to reduce transportation costs and give us first-hand knowledge of market factors affecting our cost of raw material supply. Our agricultural self-supply program, while modest at present, is expected to grow and to become a significant element of our cost containment efforts. 
 We use modern food processing technology and innovation in our formulation and manufacturing processes to create high quality products. Nitrogen preservation in particular, used in the production of convenience foods, is an innovative technology which has not been widely applied in China. 
 We are dedicated to innovation of our products. From 2012 to 2016, we were successfully granted 4 new patents. We applied for three patents to State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC during 2015. In addition, As of December 31, 2016, we possessed 16 patents for utility models and 15 patents for appearance design. See Intellectual Property below. We believe that our technology gives us an advantage over our Chinese and international competitors, allowing us to produce chestnut and convenience food products that are superior in quality and to offer more product varieties. 
 We believe that our reputation for quality contributes to our competitiveness. We maintain high food safety standards, in order to satisfy both domestic and international requirements. We also regularly conduct tests for quality of our products and compliance with standards.

Trademarks
 We have registered in the PRC the trademark 
which we use on all of our products sold in China. 
 Patents 
 We were granted two patents by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC during 2012, including the preparation of aerated snack beans and frozen bottom open chestnuts. One patent for preparation of liquor preserved fish and soup was approved in 2013. In 2014, our patent application during 2012 for the preservation, storage and processing procedures for chestnuts was approved. We made application for three patents to State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC during 2015. 
 In addition to the above-mentioned patents, we also possess 16 patents for utility models and 15 patents for appearance design. 
 We take reasonable steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, such as limiting disclosure of proprietary plans, methods and other similar information on a need-to-know basis and requiring employees with access to our proprietary technology to enter into confidentiality arrangements. We believe that our proprietary technology and trade secrets are adequately protected. 
 Our Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,425 employees. Approximately 1,075 of our full-time employees are directly employed by our subsidiary companies and the remaining employees are employed by outsourcing agents that we use to meet our staffing needs. Compared to 2015, the total employees decreased by 54.8% due to our significant production capacity declining and bad operating performance. All of the departments were hit as a result of huge loss, especially the production department and domestic sales department, because (a) all the part-time employees belong to production department. Since our revenue from main business decreased significantly, we dismissed almost all of part-time workers, approximately 1,500 workers in 2016. (b) we shut down 12 sales offices in 2016 to reduce the personnel and administrative expenses. As required by Chinese law, all employees are party to a written employment contract. We compensate the employees outsourced from agents directly and pay agents a service fee. Agents are responsible for the pension and social insurance benefits of the leased employees, as described below. 
 The following table sets forth the allocation of employees, both direct and leased, by job function.

 We believe that the relationship between management and our employees is good. We have not experienced any significant problems or disruption to our operations due to labor disputes, nor have we experienced any difficulties in recruitment and retention of experienced staff. 
 Our Shandong Lorain subsidiary has an employee relations department for the purpose of advancing employee welfare, encouraging employee participation in decision making and enhancing relations among employees and between employees and our management team. 
 We compensate our production line employees by unit produced (piece work) and compensate other employees with a base salary and bonus based on performance. We also provide training for our staffs from time to time to enhance their technical and product knowledge, including knowledge of industry quality standards.

Our employees participate in state pension scheme and various types of social insurance organized by municipal and provincial governments. Outsourcing agents are responsible for contributions on behalf of the leased employees. 
 Our Research and Development Activities 
 Our research and development efforts are focused on three objectives: 
 
 | Superior product safety and quality; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------
 | Reduction of operating costs; and 
 | Driving growth through the development of new products.

 We have research and development staffs at each of our facilities. In total, 32 employees are dedicated to research and development. 
 We rely heavily on customer feedback to assist us in the modification and development of our products. We also utilize customer feedback to assist us in the development of new products. In 2016, we added 1 new product in our frozen foods segments. 
 The amount we spent on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was not a material portion of our total expenses for those years. 
 Government Regulation 
 As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to regulations of Chinas Agricultural Ministry and Ministry of Health. This regulatory scheme governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food. It also regulates manufacturing practices, including quality assurance programs, for foods through its current manufacturing practice regulations, and specifies the standards of identity for certain foods. 
 We have obtained approvals from Chinese authorities for products that requires the approval under regulations, including chestnuts, frozen vegetables and fruits, fish, and canned products. Production of new products that do not fall into categories of products would require separate approval from the appropriate Chinese authorities. We have consistently obtained such approvals for our newly developed products in the past and do not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining new approvals in the future if needed. 
 In addition, we are required to obtain governmental approval, and to register with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, in order to open a new facility in China. We have consistently obtained such approvals, and made such registrations, for our new facilities in the past and do not anticipate any difficulties in filing new registrations and obtaining new approvals in the future if needed. 
 Under the relevant PRC sanitation laws governing food export, unless an exporters products are exempted from inspection, products must be inspected in accordance with the Law of the PRC on Import and Export Commodity Inspection. We have not been exempted from inspection. In the past, we were authorized by the relevant authorities to conduct self-inspection of certain of our export products. However, currently, the relevant authorities have imposed tighter food safety control in China, and as a result, all of our exported food products must be inspected by relevant government agencies. We believe that all of our exported products are currently in compliance with such requirements and we do not anticipate any difficulties in complying with such rules in the future. 
 In addition, we are required to obtain a license from the local branch of the Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau of China for our exported products. We have consistently obtained such licenses in the past and we do not anticipate any difficulties in obtaining such licenses in the future.
