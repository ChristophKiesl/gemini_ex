ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL

ePlus inc., sometimes referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “we,” “our,” “us,” “ourselves,” or “ePlus.”, was founded in 1990. We conduct our operations through two business segments. Our technology segment sells IT hardware products, third-party software and maintenance contracts, our own and third-party advanced professional and managed services, and our proprietary software. Our financing segment operations primarily consist of the financing of IT equipment, software and related services. Both segments sell to commercial entities, state and local governments, government contractors, and educational institutions.
OUR BUSINESS

We are a leading solutions provider that delivers actionable outcomes for organizations by using IT and consulting solutions to drive business agility and innovation. Leveraging our engineering talent, we assess, plan, deliver, and secure solutions comprised of leading technologies and consumption models aligned with our customers’ needs. Our expertise and experience enable ePlus to craft optimized solutions that take advantage of the cost, scale and efficiency of private, public and hybrid cloud in an evolving market. We also provide consulting, professional and managed services, IT staff augmentation, and complete lifecycle management services including flexible financing and solutions in the areas of security, cloud, networking, data center, collaboration and emerging technologies. We have been in the business of selling, leasing, financing, and managing IT and other assets for over 30 years.

Our primary focus is to deliver integrated solutions that address our customers’ business needs, leveraging the appropriate technologies, both on-premise and in the cloud. Our approach is to lead with advisory consulting to understand our customers’ needs, and then design, deploy and manage solutions aligned to their objectives. Underpinning the broader areas of Cloud, Security, Networking, Data Center and Collaboration are specific skills in orchestration and automation, application modernization, DevOps, data management, data visualization, analytics, network modernization, edge compute and other advanced and emerging technologies. These solutions are comprised of world class leading technologies from partners such as Amazon Web Services, Arista Networks, Check Point, Cisco Systems, Citrix, Commvault, Dell EMC, F5 Networks, Fortinet, Gigamon, HPE, Juniper Networks, Lenovo, Microsoft, NetApp, Nutanix, NVIDIA, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Pure Storage, Rubrik, Splunk, Varonis, and VMware, among many others. We possess top-level engineering certifications with a broad range of leading IT vendors that enable us to offer multi-vendor IT solutions that are optimized for each of our customers’ specific requirements. Our hosted, proprietary software solutions are focused on giving our customers more control over their IT supply chain, by automating and optimizing the procurement and management of their owned, leased, and consumption-based assets.

Our scale and financial resources have enabled us to continue investing in engineering and technology resources to stay on the forefront of technology trends. Our expertise in core and emerging technologies, buttressed by our robust portfolio of consulting, professional, and managed services, has enabled ePlus to remain a trusted advisor for our customers. In addition, we offer a wide range of consumption options including leasing and financing for technology and other capital assets. We believe our lifecycle approach offering of integrated solutions, services and financing, asset management and our proprietary supply chain software, is unique in the industry. This broad portfolio enables us to deliver a unique customer experience that spans the continuum from fast delivery of competitively priced products, services, subsequent management and upkeep, through to end-of-life disposal services. This approach permits ePlus to deploy sophisticated solutions enabling our customers’ business outcomes.

Our go-to-market strategy focuses primarily on diverse end-markets for middle market to large enterprises. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the percentage of revenue by customer end market within our technology segment includes 25% for the telecommunications, media and entertainment industry, 17% for the technology industry, 16% for state and local government, and educational institutions (“SLED”), 13% for healthcare, and 13% for financial services. Sales to a Verizon Communications Inc. represented 19% and 15% of our net sales for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales to no one customer exceeded 10% of net sales for the year ended March 31, 2019. We sell to customers in the United States (“US”), which accounts for most of our sales, and to customers in select international markets including the United Kingdom (“UK”), the European Union (“EU”), India, and Singapore. Our technology segment accounted for 96% of our net sales, and 71% of our operating income, while our financing segment accounted for 4% of our net sales, and 29% of our operating income for the year ended March 31, 2021.

 

OUR INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND MARKET OPPORTUNITY

We have identified and focused on several specific trends that we believe will create higher growth in the broader US IT market:


• | Multi-Cloud Strategy. Over the past several years, public, private and hybrid cloud architectures and cloud-enabled frameworks have become a core foundation of modern IT. Our strategy is to assist our customers in aligning cloud strategy with business objective, creating an enterprise cloud foundation, enabling multi-cloud capabilities, accelerating cloud migrations, modernizing the datacenter and extending to the cloud, and optimizing cloud deployments along with their associated costs. We focus on being a guide to customers on their Journey to Modernization of applications, data, and platforms. This strategy leverages our strength in deploying private clouds, extending them to public cloud and incorporating the necessary elements of networking and security. By understanding our customers’ environment, applications, and business requirements, we deploy solutions that leverage the most appropriate technology on the most appropriate platform with the most appropriate consumption model. For example, we may build a private cloud solution to host mission critical applications, while utilizing a public cloud solution for development, collaboration, or disaster recovery. As the market matures, we will continue to build and acquire skills that align with agile development (DevOps), application refactoring, and analytics. Our cloud strategy is tightly aligned with all our key strategic initiatives, including data center, security, networking, collaboration, and emerging technology.

• | Increasing sophistication and incidences of IT security breaches and cyber-attacks. Over the last decade, cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated, numerous, and invasive. Organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to effectively safeguard their information assets and business operations from a constant stream of advanced threats. Cyber-threats have shifted from uncoordinated individual efforts to highly coordinated and well-funded attacks by criminal organizations and nation-state actors. Additional drivers include data privacy concerns of both user data and machine data as companies continue to pursue digital transformation efforts. For most organizations, it is no longer a matter of if a cyber-attack will occur; the question is when and what impact it will have on the organization. We believe our customers are focused on all aspects of cyber security, including information and physical security, data protection, intellectual property, and compliance requirements related to industry and government regulations. To meet current and future security threats, enterprises must identify their risks, implement security controls and technology solutions that leverage integrated products and services to help monitor, mitigate, and remediate security threats and attacks while ensuring a data-centric security model that is scalable to meet today’s digital demands.

• | Disruptive technologies are creating complexity and challenges for customers and vendors. The rapid evolution of disruptive technologies, and the speed by which they impact organizations’ IT platforms, has made it difficult for customers to effectively design, procure, implement, and manage their own IT systems. Moreover, increased budget pressures, fewer internal resources, a fragmented vendor landscape and fast time-to-value expectations make it challenging for customers to design, implement and manage secure, efficient, and cost-effective IT environments. Customers are increasingly turning to IT solutions providers such as ePlus to implement complex IT offerings, including managed services, software defined infrastructure, cloud computing, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, big data analytics, and flash storage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer IT decision-making is shifting from IT departments to line-of- business personnel. As IT consumption shifts from legacy, on-premise infrastructure to agile “on-demand” and “as-a-service” solutions, customer procurement decisions are shifting from traditional IT personnel to lines-of-business personnel, which is changing the customer engagement model and types of consultative services required to fulfill customer needs. In addition, many of the services create recurring annuity revenue streams payable over time, rather than upfront revenue. Our partners are also evolving by developing more annuity models through subscription and consumption-based models operating both on-premises and the cloud.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of sufficient internal IT resources at mid-sized and large enterprises, and scarcity of IT personnel in certain high-demand disciplines. We believe that IT departments at mid-sized and large enterprises are facing pressure to deliver emerging technologies and business outcomes but lack the properly trained staff and the ability to hire personnel with high in-demand disciplines such as security and data analytics. At the same time the prevalence of security threats, increased use of cloud computing, software-defined networking, new architectures, and rapid software development frameworks, the proliferation of mobile devices, dispersed workforces, employees working from home, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies, and complexity of multi-vendor solutions, have made it difficult for IT departments to implement high-quality IT solutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduction in the number of IT solutions providers. We believe that customers are seeking to reduce the number of solutions providers they do business with to improve supply chain and internal efficiencies, enhance accountability, improve supplier management practices, and reduce costs. As a result, customers are required to select IT solutions providers that can deliver complex multi-vendor IT solutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing need for third-party services. We believe that customers are relying on third-party service providers, such as ePlus, to manage significant aspects of their IT environment, from design, implementation, pre- and post-sales support, to maintenance, engineering, cloud management, security operations, and other services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPETITION

The market for IT solutions is highly competitive, subject to macro-economic cycles and the entry of new competitors. Additionally, the consolidation of existing market participants can create significantly larger competitors and is also affected by disruptive technologies and other market activities of industry participants. We expect to continue to compete in all areas of our business against local, regional, national, and international firms, including vendors, international, national, and regional resellers and service providers. Some of our competitors are direct marketers with little value add and sell products as commodities, which can place downward pressure on product pricing. In addition, many IT vendors may sell or lease directly to our customers, and our continued ability to compete effectively may be affected by the policies of such vendors. We face indirect competition from potential customers’ internal development efforts and must overcome potential customers’ reluctance to move away from legacy systems, processes, and solution providers. As IT consumption shifts from IT personnel and legacy infrastructure to line-of-business based outcomes using off-premise, on-demand, and cloud solutions, the legacy resale model is shifting from an upfront sale to a recurring revenue model.

The leasing and financing markets are also competitive and subject to changing economic conditions and market activities of leading industry participants. We expect to continue to compete against local, regional, national, and international firms, including banks, specialty finance companies, private-equity asset managers, vendors' captive finance companies, and third-party leasing companies. Banks and other large financial services companies sell directly to business customers, particularly larger enterprise customers, and may provide other financial or ancillary services that we do not provide. Vendor captive leasing companies may use internal transfer pricing to effectively lower lease rates and/or bundle equipment sales and leasing to provide highly competitive packages to customers. Third-party leasing companies may have deep customer relationships with contracts in place that are difficult to displace; however, these competitors typically do not provide the breadth of product, service, and software offerings that we provide to our customers. Our competitors also may have access to more capital to fund more originations than us.

In all our markets, some of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and customer requirements. Many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional marketing and advertising activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do.

OUR SOLUTIONS

Technology Segment


• | IT Sales: Our offerings consist of hardware, perpetual and subscription software, maintenance, software assurance, and internally provided and outsourced services. We believe that our customers view technology purchases as integrated solutions, rather than discrete product and service categories, and the majority of our sales are derived from integrated solutions involving our customers’ data center, network, security, and collaboration infrastructure. We hold various technical and sales-related certifications from leading manufacturers and software publishers, which authorizes us to market their products and enables us to provide advanced professional services. We actively engage with emerging vendors to offer their technologies to our customers. Our flexible platform and customizable catalogs facilitate the addition of new vendors’ products with minimal incremental effort.

OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

Large Addressable Market with Long-term Growth Opportunities Driven by Increasing IT Complexity

We sell IT solutions focusing on the data center, network, cloud, security, virtualization, and mobility segments of the industry, facilitated by our professional and managed service solutions. We primarily target our sales efforts toward middle-market and large commercial entities, state and local governments, education, and healthcare customers throughout the US and in certain markets in Europe and Asia. We believe IT departments in these organizations are facing pressure to deliver higher service levels with fewer resources, increasing their reliance on third-parties who can provide complex, multi-vendor technology solutions, such as our company.
Broad and Diverse Customer Base across a Wide Range of End Markets

We have a broad and diverse customer base of over 3,500 customers across a wide range of end-markets, including education, financial services, healthcare, media and entertainment, state and local government, technology, and telecommunications.
Differentiated Business Model Serving Entire IT Lifecycle – Procurement, Solutions, Services, Software, Financing

We believe we are a trusted IT advisor, delivering differentiated products and services to enable our customers to meet increasingly complex IT requirements. We are able to provide complete, turn-key solutions aligned to the entire IT lifecycle – procurement, products, services, software, and financing. We provide upfront assessments, design and configuration capabilities, installation and implementation, and ongoing services to support our customers’ solutions.
Deep Expertise in Advanced Technology to Address Cloud, Security, Digital Infrastructure and other Emerging IT Trends

We believe our customers choose us for their complex IT infrastructure needs based on our track record of delivering best-of-breed solutions, value-added services, and close relationships with both established and emerging vendors. We focus on obtaining and maintaining top-level engineering certifications and professional services expertise in advanced technologies of strategic vendors that we leverage to help our customers achieve positive business outcomes. We have over 650 employees that collectively hold approximately 2,200 certification titles, across more than 60 vendors, with a heavy concentration in our top vendors.
Strategic Ability to Design and Integrate Cloud Solutions Across Multiple Vendors

We believe our expertise across both Data Center and Cloud architectures allows us to provide differentiated offerings in assisting our customers with their journey to the cloud. Combined with our established practices in Networking and Security, we are uniquely poised to help customers adopt a multi-cloud strategy utilizing our cloud cost management framework to help overcome the inherent challenges. We leverage our strategic partnerships with leading vendors such as Amazon Web Services, Cisco Systems, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, NetApp, and VMware in conjunction with our professional, managed and lifecycle services to help our customers achieve their desired business outcomes.
Proven Track Record of Successfully Integrating Acquisitions and Accelerating Growth

We view acquisitions as an important factor in our strategic growth plan. Since 1997, we have successfully integrated nearly 30 acquisitions. Most recently, we have been active in tuck-in acquisitions to broaden our product offerings, sector reach, and geographic footprint.

We generally integrate acquired firms into the ePlus platform immediately, which allows us to maintain customers and vendor relationships, retain key employees from acquired firms, and accelerate growth.

We continue to review new acquisition opportunities to expand our global footprint and expand our offerings.

Financial Performance Characterized by Growth and Profitability

We have focused on achieving top-line revenue growth while maintaining industry-leading gross margins – with a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% on net sales and 7.0% for consolidated gross profit, respectively, from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2021.

 

Through our organic expansion and acquisitions, we have increased our employee base by 33.0% from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2021. The increase in our employee base has largely been in customer facing roles, which represented 92.5% of the total increase in headcount over the same period, as we continue to build our sales and services team while leveraging our operational infrastructure.

GROWTH STRATEGY

Our goal is to continue to grow as a leading provider of technology solutions. The key elements of our strategy include the following:

Be Our Customers’ Partner of Choice for Comprehensive IT and Lifecycle Solutions, Including Consulting, Managed and Professional Services, and Financing

We seek to become the primary provider of IT solutions and flexible financing solutions for each of our customers, whether on-premise, cloud, hybrid or managed services-based. We strive to provide excellent customer service, pricing, availability, and advanced professional and managed services in an efficient manner. We believe the increasing complexity of the IT ecosystem and the emergence of new technologies, vendors, licensing, and service options are factors that will lead to a growing demand from existing customers. We have many experienced pre-sales engineers who engage with customers about the most advanced technologies. Our account executives are trained on our broad solutions capabilities with access to many, category-focused subject-matter experts, which allow them to sell in a consultative business outcome-based manner that increases the likelihood of cross-selling our solutions. Our account executives are supported by experienced and professional inside sales representatives. We believe that our bundled offerings are an important differentiating factor from our competitors.

We focus on gaining top-level engineering certifications and professional services expertise in advanced technologies of strategic vendors. This expertise helps our customers develop their cloud capabilities including private, public, and hybrid infrastructures. We are providing virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications, collaboration, networking, security, storage, big-data, mobility, converged and hyper-converged infrastructures, and managed services offerings, all of which remain in high demand. We believe our ability to deliver advanced professional services provides benefits in two ways. First, we gain recognition and mindshare of our strategic vendor partners and become the “go-to” partner in selected regional markets as well as the national market. This significantly increases direct and referral sales opportunities for our products and services and allows us to offer competitive pricing levels. Second, within our existing and potential customer base, our advanced professional services are a key differentiator against competitors who cannot provide services or advanced services for these key technologies or across multiple vendor product lines.

Our managed services portfolio expanded this year to include Managed SDWAN, Service Desk, Carrier Expense Management, Cloud Cost Optimization, Vulnerability Management as a Service (VMaas), Managed UCM, Hyperflex, Nutanix and Aruba monitoring and management. We have further increased our breadth and depth of engineering expertise through the integration of recent acquisitions, supplementing our Cisco service offerings, expanding our Netapp SSC/EMS portfolio, and security solutions releases. We have also enhanced our Managed Services and consolidated all ePlus annuity-based service solutions into a single service management platform to enhance customer experience. Likewise, we have increased automation of Service Level Target reporting to ensure remediation and response are top-of-mind.

Build Our Geographic Footprint

We intend to increase our direct sales and go-to-market capabilities in each of our geographic areas. We actively seek to acquire new account relationships through personal relationships, electronic commerce, leveraging our partnerships with vendors, and targeted demand-generation activities to increase awareness of our solutions. We also seek to broaden our customer base, expand our geographic reach, and improve our technology and professional services delivery capabilities. During the last fiscal year, we continued to expand our sales and delivery capabilities across multiple international markets as we see more demand for solutions within this market.
Recruit, Retain, and Develop Employees

Based on our prior experience, capital structure, and business systems and processes, we believe we are well positioned to hire experienced sales people and engineers, make strategic acquisitions that expand our customer facing talent, broaden our customer base, expand our geographic reach, scale our existing operating structure, and/or enhance our product and service offerings. Part of our growth strategy is to hire purposefully and enhance our technical and skill base through strategic acquisitions. Once recruited, we believe that that our culture, competitive performance-based compensation, policies and labor practices contribute to strong relations with our employees. We offer a range of affordable and flexible benefits options to assist with health and well-being. As our employees are an important resource to us, we invest in their ongoing professional development. Our education program provides financial support for employees who want to participate in undergraduate and graduate studies, continuing education, skill building including technical certifications, and other professional enrichment related to their position with ePlus. 
Improve Operational Efficiencies

We continue to invest in our internal technology infrastructure and software platforms to optimize our operations and engage in process re-engineering efforts to become more streamlined and cost effective.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We incur software development costs associated with maintaining, enhancing, or upgrading our proprietary software, which may be performed by internal IT development resources or by an offshore software-development company that we use to supplement our internal development team or various US-based consultants.
SALES AND MARKETING

We focus our sales and marketing efforts on becoming the primary provider of IT solutions for each of our customers. We actively seek to acquire new account relationships through personal relationships, electronic commerce, leveraging our partnerships with vendors and targeted demand-generation activities to increase awareness of our solutions. We target middle-market and large commercial entities and state and local governments, and educational institution. We currently have over 3,500 customers. We undertake direct marketing and leverage digital marketing and social media campaigns to target certain markets in conjunction with our primary vendor partners, who may provide financial reimbursement, outsourced services, and personnel to assist us in these efforts.

Our sales representatives are compensated by a combination of salary and commission, with commission becoming the primary component of compensation as the sales representatives gain experience. To date, we acquired a majority of our customers through the efforts of our direct sales force and acquisitions. We market to different areas within a customer’s organization, including business units as well as the IT department, or finance department, depending on the solutions.

As of March 31, 2021, our sales force consisted of 589 sales, marketing and sales support personnel organized regionally across the US, UK, India, and Singapore.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

Our success depends in part upon proprietary business methodologies and technologies that we have licensed and modified. We own certain software programs or have entered into software licensing agreements to provide services to our customers. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret protection, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our documentation and other written materials and confidential corporate information under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection.

For example, we currently have patents in the US and Canada. We cannot provide assurance that any patents, as issued, will prevent the development of competitive products or that our patents will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through the administrative process or litigation.

In the US, our registered trademarks include e+®, ePlus®, Procure+®, Manage+®, Docpak®, Viewmark®, OneSource®, Where Technology Means More® and GRIT: Girls Re-Imagining Tomorrow ®. We also have registered IGXGlobal®, and IGXGlobal an ePlus Technology, inc. Company® and certain variations thereon in the United Kingdom and the European Union (“EU”). We intend to use and protect these and our other marks, including common-law marks, as we deem necessary. We have over 20 registered copyrights, in addition to unregistered copyrights in our website content, software, marketing and other written materials. We believe our trademarks and copyrights have significant value and are an important factor in the marketing of our products.

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around our proprietary intellectual property.

 

FINANCIAL AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

Inventory Management: We have drop-shipment arrangements with many of our vendors and distributors, which permit us to offer products to our customers without taking physical delivery of the equipment. Ingram Micro, Arrow Enterprises, Tech Data, and Synnex Corporation are our largest distributors. Using the distribution systems available, we frequently sell products that are shipped from the vendors or distributors directly to our customers’ location, which allows us to keep our inventory of any product and shipping expenses to a minimum. For the year ended March 31, 2021, our four largest distributors accounted for over 30% of our purchases related to our technology segment net sales.
Risk Management and Process Controls: We use and maintain conservative underwriting policies and disciplined credit approval processes in both our technology and financing segments. We have an executive management review process and other internal controls in place to evaluate transactions’ potential risk.

In our technology segment, we manage our risk by using conservative credit quality analysis and periodic monitoring of customer financial results or third-party risk evaluation tools; monitoring customer accounts receivable balances and payment history; proactively pursuing delinquent accounts; ensuring we have appropriate contractual terms and conditions; perfecting security interests when practicable; requiring prepayment or deposits if indicated; performing fraud checks for new accounts; and evaluating general economic as well as industry specific trends. Our systems automatically decrease trade credit lines based on assigned risk ratings.

In our financing segment, we manage our risk in assets we finance by assigning the contractual payments due under the financing arrangement to third-parties and the continued monitoring of our customers’ credit profile. We also use agency purchase orders to procure equipment for lease to our customers and otherwise take measures to minimize our inventory of financed assets. When our technology segment is the supplier of the assets being financed, we retain certain procurement risks. Our financing arrangements with our customers are generally fixed rate.

As a result of COVID-19, we have tightened our credit lines with many of our customers, particularly in the customer end markets under significant duress such as retail. Some customers have requested extended terms which we are assessing on a case by case basis. In our financing segment, we reduced our exposure by transferring certain transactions on a non-recourse basis.

Credit Risk Loss Experience: During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we increased our allowance for credit losses by $1,436 thousand and incurred actual credit losses of $178 thousand. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we increased our allowance for credit losses by $1,004 thousand and incurred actual credit losses of $429 thousand.
BACKLOG

We rely on our vendors or distributors to fulfill a large majority of our shipments to our customers. As of March 31, 2021, we recorded customer commitments to purchase products or services that remain open until either executed or canceled (“open orders”) of $476.8 million and deferred revenue of $99.1 million. As of March 31, 2020, we had open orders of $277.6 million and deferred revenues of $72.2 million. We expect that most of the open orders and approximately 75% of deferred revenue as of March 31, 2021 will be recognized within the next 12 months.
HUMAN CAPITAL

Our employees’ collective dedication and talent enable us to be a trusted advisor to our customers.

As of March 31, 2021, we employed a total of 1,560 employees, including 1,510 in the US, 18 in the United Kingdom, 30 in India, and 2 in Singapore. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees, and none are represented by a labor union.
Our Culture

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Chief Executive Officer introduced the motto of “Be Safe, Be Smart, and Be Kind.” to convey the timeless qualities that embody the culture we have spent 30 years building and have been even more important during this past year. Through our Code of Conduct, policies, our training, and the everyday actions of our leadership, we expect our employees to treat each other, our customers, and all our business partners consistent with the “Be Safe, Be Smart, Be Kind” motto, with respect and equality for all persons.

 

Corporate social responsibility is also an important part of our culture and focus efforts around supporting the communities in which we live and work. A sample of our efforts include participating in One Tree Planted, Habitat for Humanity, and Be the Match. Since 2017, we have sponsored GRIT: Girls Re-Imagining Tomorrow in partnership with Cisco Systems, Inc. GRIT exists for the sole purpose of introducing diverse groups of middle school girls to technology-focused career possibilities, with an emphasis on cyber security and artificial intelligence.

Covid-19 Safety

During the past year, considering COVID-19, we implemented a flexible work from home strategy for all our offices, and provided training, policies and face coverings for our employees who perform essential services onsite with customers and in our integration centers, supporting critical infrastructure sectors. Our flexible work from home strategy during the pandemic is designed to keep our employees and their families as well as our communities safe, and to support those who cannot return to the office due to childcare responsibilities while schools and day care centers are closed.
Attracting Talent

While we operate in a competitive labor environment, we believe that that our culture, competitive performance-based compensation, policies and labor practices contribute to strong relations with our employees.
