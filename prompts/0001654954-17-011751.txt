  Item 1.       Business
  
  Track Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation since 2016 and previously incorporated in 1995 as a Utah corporation, has its principal place of business at 200 E. 5th Avenue Suite 100, Naperville, Illinois 60563. Our telephone number is (877) 260-2010. We maintain a corporate website at www.trackgrp.com. Our common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”), is currently listed for quotation on the OTCQX Premier marketplace (“OTCQX”) under the symbol TRCK. Unless specified otherwise, as used in this Form 10-K, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Track Group” or the “Company” refer to Track Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 Company Background
  
  The Company designs, manufactures, and markets location tracking devices and develops and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions, and monitoring applications. Our products and services include a full-range of one-piece GPS tracking devices, a device-agnostic operating system, a portfolio of software applications including smartphone, alcohol and predictive analytics, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. Our products and services are currently available worldwide and are sold through our direct sales force, as well as through value-added resellers. The Company sells to government customers on federal, state and local levels in the US and to members of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) internationally. Track Group’s device-agnostic platform and expanded portfolio of integrated and complimentary monitoring-related services help reduce risk and make the administration of justice better, faster, and less expensive for taxpayers. As of September 30, 2017, The Company’s products and platform are used to monitor over 30,000 individuals globally.
 Business Strategy
  
  We are committed to helping our customers improve offender rehabilitation and re-socialization outcomes through our innovative hardware, software, and services. We treat our business as a service business. Although we still manufacture patented tracking technology, we see the physical goods as only a small part of the integrated offender monitoring solutions we provide. So, rather than receiving a stream of ongoing revenue just for a piece of manufactured equipment, the Company is now receiving a steady stream of revenue for ongoing device agnostic subscription contracts. As part of our strategy, we continue to expand our device-agnostic platform to not only collect, but also store, analyze, assess and correlate location data for both accountability and auditing reasons, as well as to use for predictive analytics and assessment of effective and emerging techniques in criminal behavior and rehabilitation. We believe a high-quality customer experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of our products and services greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain customers. Therefore, our strategy also includes building and expanding our own direct sales force and our third-party distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a world-class sales and post-sales support experience. In addition, we are developing related-service offerings to address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors. We believe continual investment in research and development (“R&D”), including smartphone applications and other monitoring services is critical to the development and sale of innovative technologies and integrated solutions today and in the future.

  Recent Developments
  
 Marion County Agreements
 
The Company is working on finalizing two contracts with Marion County Community Corrections (“Agency”), the largest county in the state of Indiana. On October 19, 2017, the Agency’s Advisory Board approved a multi-year contract for the Company to provide electronic monitoring services (“Monitoring Contract”) across the full range of sentences under the Agency’s oversight. On November 28, 2017, the Marion County Information Technology Board approved both the Monitoring Contract and a multi-year contract for the Company to provide analytics software.
 
 Contract with the Gendarmeria de Chile

The previous multi-year agreement signed between Gendarmeria de Chile, the Republic of Chile's uniformed prison service, and Track Group in 2013, ended in October of 2017 although services have continued uninterrupted. In March 2017, a public tender process commenced as required. After submissions and reviews were complete, the results of the tender were suspended by the Chilean Court of Public Buyers following formal complaints filed by the Company and another competitor. The Company's Chilean subsidiary and Gendarmeria de Chile signed a new agreement on December 7, 2017 ("New Agreement") to provide electronic monitoring of offenders commencing on October 18, 2017 for a period of 365 days to supply monitoring services totaling up to approximately $10.6 million. The New Agreement is subject to approval by the Oficina de la Contraloria General de la República which the Company anticipates receiving within the next 30 days.
 
 Debt Exchange Agreement
 
On October 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Debt Exchange Agreement with Conrent Invest S.A. (“Conrent”), a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg regarding total debt and unpaid interest of approximately $34.7 million as of October 31, 2017 (the “Debt”) (the “Debt Exchange”). The Debt Exchange called for the Company to exchange newly issued shares of preferred stock for the entire Debt subject to approval by the investors who purchased securities from Conrent to finance the Debt (the “Noteholders”). On November 2, 2017, Conrent convened a meeting of the Noteholders to approve the Debt Exchange; however, the quorum required to approve the Debt Exchange was not achieved. Management continues to negotiate with Conrent regarding terms for the Debt Exchange acceptable to Noteholders with the objective of reaching an agreement acceptable to both Conrent and the Noteholders before the Debt matures on July 31, 2018.
 Restructuring Plan
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, the Company completed a restructuring (the “Restructuring Plan”) to streamline operations by consolidating our headquarters from Salt Lake City, Utah into our existing Chicagoland office. The Restructuring Plan also included the build-out and development of a new outsourced monitoring center located in the Chicagoland area that allowed us to upgrade operators and management, improve training, lower future expenses, and improve our ability to align workforce costs with customer demands.
 Sapinda Loan Agreement Amendment Number One
 
On March 13, 2017, the Company and Sapinda Asia Limited (“Sapinda”) entered into an agreement to amend the Loan Agreement executed by the parties on September 25, 2015 (“Amendment Number One”). Amendment Number One extends the maturity date of all loans made pursuant to the Loan Agreement to September 30, 2020. In addition, we began accruing penalties since Sapinda has not funded the remaining amount of approximately $1.5 million available on the loan on or before March 31, 2017. The penalties totaled approximately $183,000 at September 30, 2017, and the daily penalties currently exceed the daily interest due Sapinda. Further advances under the Loan Agreement are not currently expected to be forthcoming, and therefore no assurances can be given that the Company will obtain additional funds to which it is entitled under the Loan Agreement, or that the penalties accruing will ever be paid.

   The Beacon™ is a completely self-contained, short-range transmitting station that provides a Radio Frequency (RF) signal communicating with assigned offender GPS devices to increase the ability to maintain critical offender location information and provide agencies with an effective way to more accurately “tether” an offender to a specific location.
  
  Product Support and Services
  
  Monitoring Centers
   Our monitoring centers provide live 24/7/365 monitoring of all alarms generated from our devices, as well as customer and technical support. Our monitoring center operators play a vital role, and as such, are staffed with highly trained, bi-lingual individuals. These operators act as an extension of agency resources receiving alarms, communicating and intervening with offenders regarding violations, and interacting with supervision staff, all pursuant to agency-established protocols. The facilities have redundant power source, battery backup and triple redundancy in voice, data, and IP. We have assisted in the establishment of monitoring centers for customers and local partners in the United States, Chile and other global locations.
 Customer Care
   We offer a range of support options for our customers. These include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, online support including comprehensive product information, as well as technical assistance.
 Research and Development Program
  
  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we incurred research and development expense of $1,784,867, compared to $2,415,924 recognized during fiscal year 2016. The $631,057 decrease in research and development cost reflects plans implemented to lower contract labor, curtail outside services and reduce payroll costs. However, the Company also strategically invested in enhancing the firmware and software to improve the customer experience and completing the new software platform to increase scalability and add new features requested by government agencies. As a result of these investments and improvements, $2,416,804 was capitalized as developed technology during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. This represented an increase of $325,842 over the $2,090,962 capitalized as developed technology during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.
 Competition
  
  The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and we are confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of our business. These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and technological advances. Our competitors selling tracking devices have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to us include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong software ecosystem, service and support, and corporate reputation.
  
  Our specific competitors vary from market to market and we compete against other international, national and regional companies, some of whom use local partners who have more knowledge of the local markets and the government decision making process. Some of our competitors are owned by large public companies and may have access to more resources than we do, while others are backed by private equity firms with large funds, or in some cases, work as part of consortium with extensive international experience. We expect competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of our products and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with third-party providers to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.

  Competitive Strengths
  
  Industry leading Analytics Software. Remains the only fully functioning, revenue generating analytics software on the market today, specifically designed for the offender monitoring market. Several state department of corrections, county probation agencies and Sheriff’s offices have utilized this solution for more than two years.
  
  Device Agnostic Software Platform. The Company’s software platform is device agnostic and currently accommodates offender monitoring of new products that we introduce, integrates with case management software utilized by sheriff, probation and pre-trial departments, and adds devices manufactured by competitors.
  
  Smartphone Monitoring Pioneers in Criminal Justice. Today’s prison system incarcerates too many individuals who pose little threat to public safety, at far too great a cost. They serve their sentences in overcrowded, outdated institutions that expose them to hardened criminals. Upon release, their opportunities and lives have changed forever. Now, low-risk offender populations can serve their sentences virtually, holding jobs and taking care of family members, yet still feeling the weight of their punishment while seeing a clear path to avoiding trouble in the future. And taxpayers gain a clear cost advantage. Today, we have developed apps targeting alcohol monitoring, domestic violence and our core monitoring platform.
  
  Experienced Senior Management Team. Our top executives have extensive experience in both the offender monitoring marketplace and their specific fields of expertise whether that be sales, customer care and technology. We also benefit from a diverse and experienced Board of Directors.
  
  Recurring Revenue. The Company’s revenue is generated in large part by long-term customer contracts based on the size of the offender monitoring program throughout each month which creates a predictable, recurring revenue stream.
  
 
  Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers. The Company has developed strong relationships with federal, state and county customers within the United States and with Ministries of Justice internationally.
  
  Extensive Product Suite. The Company has a large variety of products that appeal to a broad range of government customers and greatly enhances our ability to attract and retain clients. These products include different GPS devices, alcohol monitoring and new smartphone applications including those that address adjacent market opportunities in both the public and private sectors and analytics software.
  
  National Footprint with International Presence. The Company operates in approximately 42 states as well as select international locations including Chile. Our presence both within the United States and abroad better positions the Company to compete for new and expiring government contracts.
  
  Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
  
  We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of our product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
 Dependence on Major Customers
  
  We had sales to entities, two of which represents more than ten percent of gross revenues, as follows for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016:
  
 
 | 2017 | % | 2016 | % 
-----------+------------+-----+------------+----
Customer A | $8,747,338 | 29% | $7,543,116 | 28%
Customer B | $3,743,508 | 13% | $2,013,929 | 7% 
Customer C | $2,326,318 | 8% | $1,573,959 | 6% 


 
  No other customer represented more than 10 percent of the Company’s total revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 or 2016. (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

  Concentration of credit risk associated with our total and outstanding accounts receivable as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are shown in the table below: 
  
 
 | 2017 | % | 2016 | % 
-----------+------------+-----+------------+----
Customer A | $1,657,316 | 30% | $2,476,168 | 36%
Customer B | $641,973 | 12% | $899,428 | 13%
Customer C | $394,253 | 7% | $548,867 | 8% 

 Dependence on Major Suppliers
  
  We purchase cellular services from several major suppliers. The cost to us for these services during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 was $2,178,895 and $1,581,219, respectively. The 38% increase in cellular service expense in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted from increased costs associated with higher revenue and resulting cost of sales and the consolidation of smaller suppliers into national suppliers, partially offset by lower pricing on contracts negotiated in fiscal 2017.
  
  During the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, we also purchased a significant portion of our inventory and monitoring equipment from certain suppliers. The cost during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 of these purchases was $1,838,779 and $1,488,515, respectively. The 24% increase was due to the shut-down of the 2G cellular network resulting from the one-time replacement of these 2G units and higher demand due to growth for products purchased from these suppliers.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software and services. The Company has registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries. Although we believe the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
  
  The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design, and are currently pursuing numerous patent applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world. The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of our products and services. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting our products. The Company believes the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.
  
  Many of the Company’s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses can be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of technological changes in the industries in which we compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our products, processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. 
  
  Trademarks. We have developed and use trademarks in our business, particularly relating to our corporate and product names. The Company owns 10 trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, plus one trademark registered in Mexico and one in Canada. In addition, we have the Track Group trademark and design registered in various countries around the world.

  The Company will file additional applications for the registration of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions as our business expands under current and planned distribution arrangements. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration in the United States.

  Trade Secrets.  The Company owns certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
  
  The Company intends to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
  
  Government Regulation
 
  Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations.
 Seasonality
  
  Given the consistency in recurring domestic monitoring revenues by customers throughout 2017, we detected no apparent seasonality in our business. However, as in previous years, incremental domestic device deployment opportunities typically slow down in the months of July and August. We believe this is due to the unavailability of judicial and corrections officials who observe a traditional vacation season during this period.
 Employees
  
  As of December 8, 2017, we had 154 full-time employees and two part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and management believes that relations with employees are good.
