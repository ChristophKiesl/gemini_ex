Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on pioneering a new approach to treat complex diseases using compositions of endogenous metabolic modulators, or EMMs. Our product candidates are comprised of multiple EMMs that are engineered in distinct combinations and ratios with the goal of simultaneously impacting multiple biological pathways. Our pipeline includes lead therapeutic candidates for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, for the treatment of Long COVID (also known as Post COVID-19 Condition and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19, or “PASC”) associated fatigue, and for the reduction in risk of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy, or OHE. 
Using our discovery platform, we have efficiently designed product candidates that are comprised of amino acids and their derivatives, which have a general history of safe use. The orally administered EMM compositions that we have tested clinically to date in our development model have shown the potential to generate multifactorial effects in our initial Clinical Studies. For instance:
•In our AXA1125-003 Clinical Study, AXA1125 was well tolerated in subjects with presumed NASH, and no significant safety signals were observed in patients dosed with this candidate. Additionally, sustained reductions versus placebo over 16 weeks were noted across key biomarkers of metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis, including magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and propeptide of type III collagen (ProC3). Among subjects with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the study (~40% of the overall study cohort), reductions in most biomarkers tended to be of a higher magnitude compared to the overall cohort. Based on AXA1125’s multi-targeted design and these data, we believe this candidate holds the potential to serve as a first-line NASH monotherapy for both adult and pediatric patients and be used in combination with other agents if required.
•In our AXA1665-002 Clinical Study, AXA1665 was well tolerated in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic insufficiency and no significant safety signals were observed in patients dosed with this candidate. Additionally, dose dependent changes were noted across measures of amino acid metabolism and neurocognition over 12 weeks. These included statistically significant (p <0.05) improvements in the Fischer Ratio and the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) in the AXA1665 high dose arm versus placebo. Additionally, clinically relevant trends were seen in certain measures of nitrogen/ammonia handling and physical function in the AXA1665 arms versus placebo. Based on AXA1665’s differentiated, multi-targeted design and these data, we believe this candidate holds the potential to reduce OHE events and improve the quality of life for cirrhotic patients.
Based on the strength of these results, in 2021:
•An investigational new drug (IND) filing was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for AXA1125. This enabled us to initiate our EMMPACT Phase 2b Clinical Trial in NASH. EMMPACT is a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that is evaluating the efficacy and safety of AXA1125 in approximately 270 patients with biopsy-confirmed F2/F3 NASH. This trial is now enrolling patients globally.

•A clinical trial authorization (CTA) filing was cleared by the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for AXA1125 in Long COVID, enabling us to initiate our Phase 2a Clinical Trial. This is a 28-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXA1125 in approximately 40 patients with exertional fatigue related to Long COVID. This trial is now enrolling patients in the United Kingdom.
•An IND filing was cleared by the FDA for AXA1665. This enabled us to initiate our EMMPOWER Phase 2 Clinical Trial in OHE. EMMPOWER is a global 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that is evaluating the efficacy and safety of AXA1665 in approximately 150 patients who have experienced at least one prior OHE event and have neurocognitive dysfunction at screening. This trial is now enrolling patients globally.
About Endogenous Metabolic Modulators (EMMs)
EMMs encompass a broad set of molecular families, including amino acids, bile acids, other intermediary substrates, and hormones. Together, these molecules can serve as master regulators and signaling agents, driving multiple pathways to elicit multifactorial effects, including mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics, nutrient sensing and handling, immune response and inflammation, reactive oxygen response, vascular function, neurotransmitter signaling, tissue repair, and autophagy.
Metabolic dysregulation results from a disruption in human homeostasis that is core to optimal functioning and consequently, health. Maintenance of this equilibrium requires an orchestration of multiple metabolic pathways and inter-organ signaling, evolved over billions of years, and is carried out by signaling intermediates and endogenous mediators. EMMs are a critical subset of such endogenous elements that regulate metabolic function. More recently, the role of various EMMs, including amino acids, in nutrient sensing and cellular signaling have been elucidated.
The loss of homeostasis can be manifested in many conditions and complex diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, or T2D, NASH and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, Long COVID, OHE, and muscle atrophy. As an example, dysregulation in the metabolic processes and pathways controlled by the liver, such as de novo lipogenesis or gluconeogenesis, can lead to an inability to adequately handle fuel substrates such as fats or carbohydrates. This ultimately results in fatty liver and insulin resistance, key features of NASH. Similarly, a complex cascade of substrate dysregulation within skeletal muscles, a key organ involved in glucose disposal and utilization of amino acids as substrates for protein synthesis, can result in insulin resistance, intramuscular fat infiltration and muscle mass loss, thus decreasing muscle function. Muscle mass loss, or sarcopenia, is increasingly linked to clinical outcomes and overall survival, such as in end-stage liver disease (cirrhotic sarcopenia).
We believe that our EMM compositions have the potential to address system-wide metabolic dysregulation to restore, improve, support and/or maintain homeostasis in complex diseases where more than one pathway may be dysregulated. For example, in NASH, there are disordered pathways causing dysregulated metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. We believe these biologies can be regulated via multiple pathways using AXA1125, a proprietary combination of six amino acids and derivatives.
In addition to their known biological impacts, amino acids also have a long history of general safe use across a wide spectrum of ages and underlying medical conditions. As a result, we believe our EMM compositions will have limited off-target effects in humans as compared to traditional pharmaceutical agents and will have limited potential to cause drug-drug interactions. All the above factors taken together provide the potential to bring about a transformation in treating complex diseases and/or supporting health.

Our EMM Composition Design Approach
Our systems biology and discovery platform allow us to efficiently design and test multi-targeted EMM compositions with the aim of restoring and maintaining cellular and system-wide homeostasis in multiple biologies and pathways. This platform integrates advanced data science, cell biology capability, and expertise, leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data sets that are available both publicly and through institutional human data registries. This data-rich environment, combined with our internal discovery and data science tools, provides for the rapid identification of potential new biological applications and the design of EMM compositions to target specific biologies. 
Our platform integrates digital knowledge of amino acid and related molecules and the ecosystem of internal and external data on disease, pathways, genes, and our existing and in-development EMM compositions. As part of our cell biology capability, our human primary cell systems directly inform multiple biological mechanisms implicated in disease and metabolic dysregulations. All of this is supported by a comprehensive EMM safety database derived from the literature and our previous Clinical Studies and ongoing Clinical Trials. The data and learnings generated through this process further enrich and anchor our design process against clinically relevant biologies. 
Through a combination of biological and data science capability, program and disease-specific data can subsequently be utilized to elucidate the stoichiometric ratios for EMM compositions, more accurately characterize their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and develop a biomarker strategy. The data is also utilized to build a variety of translational models to facilitate the pharmacologic and treatment response characterization, paving the way for translation into the clinic. 
Rapid Advancement into Human Clinical Trials
Nonclinical Research
Upon prioritization of an area of interest for clinical development, we leverage internal data and external human data registries to elucidate biological and phenotypic features to design multi-targeted EMM compositions against relevant canonical and non-canonical pathways. This allows us to leverage the appropriate primary human cell models and in vitro assays to provide data that can be assessed in a translationally relevant way. We conduct our model systems in environments that aim to simulate physiological levels of biofluids and nutrients. These models include multiple cell types to deconstruct dysregulated metabolism or disease conditions and isolate effects of EMM compositions on subsets of metabolic pathways. The throughput of these models enables us to test individual EMMs, simple combinations of EMMs as well as complete EMM compositions to identify and understand interactions and characterize the function of each of the utilized constituents.
Preclinical pharmacology, biology experiments, and advanced modeling capabilities inform the design of our EMM compositions (i.e., amounts and ratios), the development of a biomarker strategy, and translation into the clinic. We also evaluate whether existing in-vivo models can inform our design and translation process, de-risking our translation into the clinic. Animal models are commonly used in drug development with the primary goal of investigating safety. Given the generally regarded as safe (GRAS) status of the EMMs utilized in our compositions, we are able to avoid many of these costly and time-intensive models, which we believe provides us with additional development efficiencies.

Clinical Development Approach 
Once a product candidate is designed, we then decide whether to evaluate the candidate in a Clinical Study or under a Clinical Trial. We conduct our Clinical Studies under the FDA’s September 2013 Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) entitled “Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND,” which we believe allows for Clinical Studies to be conducted to assess a food product’s safety, tolerability and effect on normal structures or functions in humans in healthy and diseased subjects. Our Clinical Studies include a substantial number of biomarkers that may improve our understanding of biologies relevant to the healthy structures and functions of the body as well as the safety, tolerability and dose-response relationship on relevant biologies. The ability to interrogate the effect of an EMM composition directly in human biologies makes the process of candidate selection both time and resource efficient. These Clinical Studies are not designed or intended to evaluate a product candidate’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease or other health condition. 
To date, we have completed clinical investigations of our product candidates in Clinical Studies. Based on initial Clinical Study results, we decided to pursue further development of AXA1125 and AXA1665 as therapeutics via Clinical Trials under INDs and a CTA. These Clinical Trials, which have been initiated, are, therefore, evaluating each product candidate’s ability to treat targeted diseases. 
On average, it has been estimated that it takes seven or more years for a therapeutic to progress from product candidate design to Phase 2 development. Our approach has enabled us to rapidly design and investigate our product candidates, providing meaningful insights into their safety, tolerability, and biological activity in diseased human subjects. As a result of our approach, we were able to initiate our Phase 2 trials approximately four years after finalizing the design of our lead product candidates, which we believe validates the speed and efficiency of our approach.

AXA1125 for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)
AXA1125 is currently being developed as an oral product candidate for the treatment of NASH. In 2021, our IND for this candidate was cleared by the FDA, enabling us to proceed directly into a global Phase 2b Clinical Trial that was initiated in the second quarter of 2021. We branded this global trial EMMPACT based on the potential for AXA1125, an EMM composition, to deliver meaningful, multifactorial clinical benefits to patients with NASH. Based on AXA1125’s differentiated, multi-targeted design and data from our earlier Clinical Studies, we believe this candidate holds the potential to serve as a first-line NASH monotherapy for both adult and pediatric patients and be used in combination with other agents if required.
About NAFLD and NASH
While the pathologies of NAFLD and NASH manifest primarily in the liver, they are systemic diseases driven by multifactorial systemic dysregulation of pathways associated with metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Dysfunctional lipid metabolism associated with insulin resistance and hepatocyte lipotoxicity increases liver cell death. Systemic and chronic inflammation at the cellular and cytokine level drives tissue damage and activates fibrogenic pathways. Activation of stellate cells then causes accumulation of collagen in the liver and leads to progressive fibrosis.
NAFLD is one of the most common causes of liver disease in the United States. It is characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver, typically resulting from obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. In addition, in association with the rise of childhood obesity, NAFLD emerging as a significant medical need in children.
NAFLD can progress to NASH, which is characterized by necroinflammation and fibrosis, and may ultimately lead to life-threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer, requiring liver transplant. According to the Global Liver Institute’s U.S. NASH Action Plan published in December 2020, up to 40 million people in the U.S. alone are living with NASH and approximately 10% of U.S. children are afflicted with this disease. Incidence is expected to continue increasing in parallel with the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics. This same report estimates that the lifetime costs for all U.S. NASH patients now exceeds $300 billion, reflecting the severity of this public health issue and its substantial burden on the overall healthcare system. 
A combination of dietary modifications and increased physical activity remains the standard of care for management of NAFLD and NASH. Currently, there are no approved drug therapies for NASH in the United States. 
To date, most compounds in development have focused on single key targets within metabolic, inflammation or fibrosis pathways. Few, however, have demonstrated therapeutic benefit, which by current regulatory standards is defined as steatohepatitis resolution with no worsening of fibrosis or improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis. Moreover, safety and tolerability are paramount in this chronic condition and in this patient population, which suffers from a range of comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Significant challenges to this approach include the potential for compounding of overlapping side effect profiles, drug-drug interactions and high development and treatment costs. 
We believe a multitargeted agent that impacts metabolism/liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis, is orally administered, and that is safe, well tolerated and without drug-drug interactions would be well positioned for first-line use in both pediatric and adult NASH. 
AXA1125 in NASH
AXA1125 is an oral product candidate that contains six amino acids and derivatives. This product candidate, which has been granted a Fast Track Designation for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis, targets multiple pathways that affect metabolism, inflammation and fibrogenesis, providing the potential to treat patients with NASH.
Table of Contents


Underlying Biology | Potential Benefits of AXA1125 Treatment 
Metabolism | Lower lipotoxicity, improve insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function by enhancing fatty acid beta-oxidation via activation of pathways such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and AMPK
Inflammation | Modulate apoptosis, macrophage function, reduce hepatic inflammatory mediators and improve gut epithelial integrity 
Fibrosis | Reduce hepatic stellate cell activation and proliferation and decrease hepatic fibrogenesis by downregulating certain pathways, including TGFβ and Hif1α 

Most Recent Completed Clinical Study: AXA1125-003
We have conducted two prior Clinical Studies of AXA1125 in subjects with presumed NASH. AXA1125 was generally well tolerated in both of these studies with meaningful and sustained reductions shown in key measures of hepatic fat, insulin resistance, inflammation and fibrosis. In 2020, Axcella completed its most recent Clinical Study of AXA1125, AXA1125-003. This was a 16-week (with a two-week follow-up), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Clinical Study to assess safety, tolerability and impact on the liver structure and function of two distinct EMM compositions, AXA1125 and AXA1957, in 102 adult subjects with NAFLD. Key inclusion criteria for this study included having at least 10% fat by MRI-PDFF and a corrected T1, or cT1, a measure of liver injury by multiparametric MRI, of at least 830 mSec. Subjects were stratified by the presence or absence of T2D. In this study, subjects received either AXA1125, two different doses of AXA1957 or a calorie-matched placebo control twice a day, or BID (see figure below).

2. Calorie matched placebo control.
Table of Contents

Results from the study showed that AXA1125 and AXA1957 were generally well-tolerated, with sustained reductions noted for both product candidates versus placebo in key biomarkers of metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis over 16 weeks. Overall, as compared to placebo, AXA1125 demonstrated larger and more consistent reductions in clinically relevant biomarkers than AXA1957. Among subjects receiving AXA1125, 39% achieved a ≥30% relative reduction in liver fat content (MRI-PDFF), 39% achieved a ≥17 U/L reduction in alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), and 35% achieved a ≥80 mSec reduction in corrected T1 (cT1). Among the 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes receiving AXA1125, a greater proportion achieved each of these thresholds. Emerging evidence suggests that these thresholds of activity increase the likelihood of histopathological improvement in NASH subjects. 
Notably, the above results were seen without impacting mean body weight or serum lipids. The adverse events (AEs) experienced in ≥10% of subjects were gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, reduced appetite) and upper respiratory infection. Gastrointestinal AEs were generally mild and transient, self-resolving in two to three weeks on average. Two serious adverse events were reported, both of which were determined to be unrelated to study product administration.
Ongoing Phase 2b EMMPOWER Clinical Trial
Following FDA clearance of an IND application for AXA1125, we initiated our EMMPACT Phase 2b Clinical Trial for this candidate in the second quarter of 2021. This global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Clinical Trial is evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of AXA1125 in adult patients with biopsy-confirmed F2/F3 NASH. Approximately 270 patients will be enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 45.2 or 67.8 grams per day of AXA1125 or a matched placebo in two divided doses for 48 weeks, with a four-week safety follow-up period. Patients will be stratified based on the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes.
The Clinical Trial’s primary endpoint will assess the proportion of patients with a biopsy-confirmed ≥2-point improvement in their NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) after the 48-week treatment period. Secondary endpoints will include the proportion of patients achieving biopsy-confirmed resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis and the proportion of patients achieving a ≥1 stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH, as well as a range of non-invasive markers, such as MRI-PDFF, vibration controlled transient elastography (Fibroscan™), liver enzymes and measures of insulin resistance.

AXA1125 for the Treatment of Long COVID
AXA1125 is also currently being developed as a product candidate for the treatment of Long COVID. In October 2021, we announced that our CTA for this candidate was cleared by the MHRA in the United Kingdom, enabling us to proceed directly into a Phase 2a Clinical Trial, which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021. Based on AXA1125’s differentiated, multi-targeted design and data from our earlier Clinical Studies, we believe this candidate holds the potential to serve as a first-line Long COVID therapy for patients.
About Long COVID 
Long-term effects, particularly fatigue, have been reported with a variety of viral infections, including West Nile, Zika, Dengue, Zika, seasonal flu as well as the other corona-related viruses such as MERS and SARS-1. Long COVID, also known as Post COVID-19 Condition and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19, or PASC, has generally been defined as a condition, experienced by patients at least 12 weeks after COVID-19 infection, in which they experience a range of symptoms that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Emerging research indicates that Long COVID can be experienced by anyone who has contracted COVID-19, regardless of the variant with which they were infected, whether their illness was mild or severe, or whether the individual was vaccinated or unvaccinated. 
It is generally estimated that between 20-30% of all people who are infected by COVID-19 will experience Long COVID. While this condition encompasses dozens of symptoms, fatigue is the most predominant of them, impacting a majority of Long COVID patients. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly being implicated in published studies as an overarching mechanism of Long COVID fatigue and muscle weakness. In this setting, mitochondrial dysfunction includes dysregulated energetics, increased inflammation and oxidative stress, as well dysregulated lipid and amino acid metabolism. It is hypothesized that the COVID-19 virus can trigger a cascade within cells that may include a fuel switch to inefficient glycolysis, compromises cellular bioenergetics and respiration, an increase in oxidative stress, causing compounding inflammation, and an impairment in immune response. Ultimately, this virally mediated cellular reprogramming is believed to contribute to the symptoms of exertional fatigue and muscle weakness that can be persistent, severe, and debilitating. The sheer number of COVID-19 infected patients throughout the world, occurring contemporaneously, may enable better mechanistic insights into mitochondrial dysfunction not only in Long COVID, but also across a range of post-viral syndromes.
AXA1125 in Long COVID
In two prior successful Clinical Studies and in preclinical models, we believe AXA1125 has demonstrated an ability to restore mitochondrial function, providing the potential to treat patients with Long COVID. 

Underlying Biology | Potential Benefits of AXA1125 Treatment 
Dysregulated energetics, with a switch to inefficient glycolysis | Increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced glycolysis 
Increased oxidative stress and inflammation | Reduced inflammation, restoration of reactive oxygen species, improved vascular perfusion
Dysregulated fatty acid and lipid metabolism | Restored fatty acid and lipid metabolism, upregulated beta-oxidation

Phase 2a Long COVID Clinical Trial
Following clearance of a CTA filing by the United Kingdom’s MHRA, we initiated a Phase 2a Clinical Trial of AXA1125. The Phase 2a trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXA1125 in patients with exertional fatigue related to Long COVID. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled and randomized evenly to receive either 67.8 grams per day of AXA1125 or a matched placebo in two divided doses for 28 days, with a one-week safety follow-up period. This same daily dose of AXA1125 already been investigated in a 12-week Clinical Study in subjects with presumed NASH and was generally well tolerated.
The Phase 2a trial’s primary endpoint will assess the improvement of mitochondrial function within the skeletal muscle as measured by changes in phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery time, as measured by 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), from baseline to Day 28. PCr recovery time is a well-established and highly sensitive measure that has been strongly correlated with the 6-minute walk (6MW) test, a functional measure that has been used as a registrational endpoint in several other diseases in which fatigue and muscle weakness play a central role. Key secondary endpoints include lactate levels, a 6MW test, fatigue scores, and safety and tolerability. The Clinical Trial is being conducted with researchers at Oxford University’s Radcliffe Department of Medicine in the United Kingdom.
AXA1665 for the Reduction in Risk of Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy (OHE) Recurrence
AXA1665 is currently being developed as a product candidate for the reduction in risk of OHE recurrence in adult patients with liver cirrhosis. In 2021, we announced that our IND for this candidate was cleared by the FDA, enabling us to proceed directly into a Phase 2 Clinical Trial, which was initiated in the second quarter of 2021. We have branded the Phase 2 trial EMMPOWER based on the potential for AXA1665, an EMM composition, to help patients, physicians and other caregivers overcome significant challenges associated with cirrhosis and OHE. Based on AXA1665’s differentiated, multi-targeted design and data gathered to date, we believe this candidate holds the potential to reduce OHE events and improve the quality of life for cirrhotic patients.

About OHE and Cirrhosis
Long-term damage to the liver from various causes, such as alcohol, hepatitis B or C viral infections, NASH, or autoimmune hepatitis, can lead to permanent scarring, a condition called cirrhosis. It has been reported that prevalence of cirrhosis in the United States is approximately 0.27%, corresponding to nearly 700,000 adults, of which 69% reported that they were unaware of having liver disease. Decompensated cirrhosis is a serious systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction, resulting in a variety of significant complications, including HE, bacterial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, and ascites, which is the build-up of excess fluid in the abdomen. Transition from compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis reportedly occurs at a rate of approximately 5% to 7% per year.
HE is one of the most common complications of cirrhosis with multiple contributing factors, such as amino acid imbalance, ammonia toxicity, muscle wasting, infections and constipation, all of which ultimately result in diminished brain function. Emerging data suggest that muscle mass and function are key independent factors associated with progression to and severity of overt HE, or OHE. It is estimated that up to 60% of cirrhosis subjects have sarcopenia and, separately, 40% have HE symptoms. OHE refers to the presence of neurological abnormalities that are clinically apparent and do not require specialized psychometric testing. By contrast, minimal, or covert, HE is less severe and requires specialized testing for its diagnosis, including psychometric tests. OHE is well-established as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the cirrhotic population and is an area that continues to have unmet medical needs.
Furthermore, muscle depletion and muscle fat infiltration occurring during cirrhosis independently increase the risk of both overt and minimal HE with increased mortality. Decline in muscle mass can also hamper the alternative pathway of ammonia detoxification, and hyperammonemia may further worsen sarcopenia, generating a vicious cycle. The highly interdependent complications of cirrhosis, sarcopenia and OHE constitute a significant disease burden and can have an impact on irreversible morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. We estimate that approximately 63,000 to 130,000 individuals may be affected at any given time with both cirrhotic sarcopenia and OHE in the United States.
While there are three approved therapies for OHE, each focuses primarily on ammonia reduction, and despite their use, many patients continue to experience OHE breakthrough events. We believe there is a strong need for additional OHE treatment options, particularly those that have the potential to address the systemic complications of cirrhosis, including frailty.
AXA1665
AXA1665 is a composition of eight amino acids and derivatives that is administered orally and holds the potential to influence multiple metabolic pathways intersecting key organ systems (liver, muscle and gut) to treat patients with OHE.

Underlying Biology | Potential Benefits of AXA1665 Treatment 
Plasma amino acid imbalance | Maximize proteogenesis and reduce systemic aromatic amino acids 
Dysregulated ammonia handling | Stimulate urea cycle function, intestinal and renal nitrogen metabolism, and induce intramuscular ammonia detoxification
Muscle wasting | Increase muscle protein synthesis by addressing metabolic demand and stimulating mTORC1 
Neurocognitive impairment | Improve neurocognition and reduce OHE events

Most Recently Completed Clinical Study: AXA1665-002
We have conducted two prior Clinical Studies of AXA1665 in subjects with mild (Child Pugh A) and moderate (Child Pugh B) hepatic insufficiency. AXA1665 was generally well tolerated in both studies, with multifactorial effects seen in subjects. In 2020, Axcella completed its most recent Clinical Study of AXA1665, AXA1665-002. This was a 12-week (with a four-week follow-up) randomized, placebo-controlled Clinical Study to assess AXA1665’s safety, tolerability and impact on normal liver and muscle structures and functions in approximately 60 subjects with mild (Child A) and moderate (Child B) hepatic insufficiency.
1. Study design for AXA1665-002. This Clinical Study was initiated prior to determination of AXA1665 as a therapeutic product candidate.
Results from the study showed that AXA1665 demonstrated dose dependent improvements across all three psychometric tests that were utilized. These included a statistically significant (p <0.05) improvement for the high dose arm vs. placebo in the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), which is a highly specific assessment to diagnose minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). A higher proportion of subjects in the AXA1665 arms also achieved a ≥0.3 absolute reduction in liver frailty index, or LFI, versus placebo. Previous studies suggest that a ≥0.3 reduction in the LFI score may correlate with an improved ability to conduct activities of daily living in subjects with end-stage liver disease. Additionally, a dose dependent and statistically significant (p <0.05) increase from baseline in Fischer Ratio (FR; a measure of branched chain amino acids ÷ aromatic amino acids) was seen in the AXA1665 arms relative to placebo, which was sustained over 12 weeks. Despite the increased nitrogen load delivered via the amino acids in AXA1665, fasted plasma ammonia levels remained stable in the active arms over the 12-week dosing duration. In a subset of subjects with evidence of MHE at baseline as assessed by PHES, a mean reduction from baseline in fasted plasma ammonia levels was observed in subjects receiving both doses of AXA1665 at week 12.
Both doses of AXA1665 were generally well tolerated. Rates of adverse events (AEs) were low, mostly unrelated to study product and generally mild or moderate. There were five serious adverse events reported in the study and two deaths (one due to complications of COVID-19; one due to a myocardial infarction during the study run-in period prior to dosing), none of which were determined to be related to AXA1665.

Ongoing Phase 2 EMMPOWER Clinical Trial
Following FDA clearance of an IND application for AXA1665, we initiated our EMMPOWER Phase 2 Clinical Trial for this candidate in the second quarter of 2021. This global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center investigation is evaluating the efficacy and safety of AXA1665 in patients who have experienced at least one prior OHE event and have neurocognitive dysfunction at screening. Approximately 150 patients on lactulose ± rifaximin (stratified by rifaximin use) will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 53.8 grams per day of AXA1665 or a matched placebo in three divided doses for 24 weeks, with a four-week safety follow-up period.
The Clinical Trial’s primary endpoint will assess the proportion of patients with a ≥2-point increase in the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) after the 24-week treatment period. Key secondary endpoints will focus on the proportion of patients experiencing an OHE breakthrough event and time to first OHE breakthrough event, including time to hospitalization. Other secondary endpoints include changes in physical function and patient-reported outcomes. 
Future Pipeline Opportunities 
Many EMMs, including amino acids, are well established agents used to support health. Single EMMs and simple EMM combinations are already approved as treatments for sickle cell disease, dyslipidemia, inborn errors of metabolism and other conditions. We believe EMM compositions have the potential to address a variety of diseases and conditions, including areas related to metabolism, muscle atrophy, mitochondrial biology, neuroprotection, inflammation, and immunology. We intend to continue to target biologies and disease areas driven by regulation of metabolic pathways in which we can potentially leverage the vital role that EMMs play in regulating metabolic function.

Intellectual Property
We are establishing a broad, global intellectual property portfolio for our technology and have already received 9 issued U.S. patents, including both composition of matter and method of use claims. This is notable considering the speed of our development model and establishes a foundation for the large number of submitted applications for our pipeline (277 patents pending worldwide as of December 31, 2021). Our matrixed approach to IP is inclusive of trade secrets and trademarks and encompasses our product candidates (various constituents and amounts); indications; the development platform; manufacturing processes and technologies; and formulations. In our patents for compositions and methods of use, we seek claims of broad and narrow scope. For instance, some claims cover any composition containing a minimum of specified EMMs with activity, while other claims expressly cover specific product candidates by naming all the EMMs present.
We seek to create a multi-dimensional intellectual property portfolio as a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or through collaborations, or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to file patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of leveraging EMMs for treating complex diseases and improving health. We additionally rely on regulatory-related protections such as data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, and where appropriate, plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements. Please see the section on "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property." 
As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio consisted of 21 patent families, 9 granted U.S. patents and 277 worldwide patents pending. To date, all of our patent rights are owned by us. Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications to protect our product candidates and certain aspects of our development platform, manufacturing processes, formulations, and insights into amounts, uses, and features of our EMM compositions.
In addition, we own a portfolio of legacy patents and patent applications related to recombinant proteins for nutrition and therapeutics, including 11 granted U.S. patents and 3 pending U.S. patent applications, and 7 granted foreign patents and 7 pending foreign patent applications.
Examples of the product candidate and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below.
Indication-Related Intellectual Property
The indication-related patent rights in our intellectual property portfolio relate to conditions and disorders associated with dysregulated metabolism and provide coverage for product candidates to specifically address those conditions and the associated disease states, as well as structure and function of normal organs in the context of dysregulated metabolism. The indication-related patent applications for our lead programs cover novel product candidate compositions and their uses broadly and, with respect to individual product candidates, in detail. Often, we are able to exemplify even our earliest product candidate inventions with human as well as animal and in vitro data. Each of the indication-related patent rights and applications described below are owned by us and are not licensed from any third party.
Table of Contents

Notably, while our intellectual property covers drug and non-drug areas, to date, each initial product candidate has been first tested as a food in order to better understand safety, tolerability and the impact on normal human physiology and metabolic pathways. After such initial testing, a decision may be made to deem the product candidate a drug product candidate, and subsequent studies on disease endpoints are conducted under INDs. 
Compositions and Methods for Treatment of Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19)
Our patents on compositions of matter covering AXA1125 include its use in a Long COVID indication. Currently, patent rights relating specifically to Long COVID and related conditions include 2 U.S. provisional patent applications. We would expect any granted patent based on this portfolio to expire in 2042, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
Compositions and Methods for NAFLD/NASH
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for fatty liver disease, including our drug product candidate AXA1125. Currently, patent rights relating to AXA1125 and related compositions and their uses in fatty liver disease include 4 granted U.S. patents, 1 U.S. patent application, and over 40 foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2037, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
A second family of applications directed more specifically to related compositions and uses currently includes 1 U.S. patent application and 2 foreign national patent applications. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Cirrhosis
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for cirrhosis, including our drug product candidate AXA1665. Currently, patent rights relating to cirrhosis include 2 granted U.S. patents, 1 pending U.S. patent application, and over 40 foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2038, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
A second family of applications directed to unique features and uses of AXA1665 and related compositions currently includes 1 PCT patent application. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2040, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Compositions and Methods for Blood and Sickle Cell Disease
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for blood health and sickle cell disease. Currently, this family of applications includes 1 granted U.S. patent, 1 U.S. patent application and over 35 foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
A second family of applications directed more specifically to related compositions and uses currently includes 1 PCT patent application. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2040, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Compositions and Methods for Acute Muscle Atrophy
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for muscle atrophy. Currently, patent rights relating to muscle atrophy include 1 U.S. patent application and over 35 foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this family to expire in 2037, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
Table of Contents

A second family of applications directed to unique features and uses of related compositions currently includes 2 granted U.S. patents, 1 U.S. patent application, and 6 foreign national patent applications. We expect the patent applications in this second family, if issued, to expire in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Compositions and Methods for Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury and Stroke
Our patent applications cover a class of compositions for traumatic brain injury and stroke. Currently, patent rights relating to traumatic brain injury include 2 U.S. patent application and over 20 foreign national patent applications. We expect any granted patent based on this portfolio to expire in 2038, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Additional AXA Combination-Related Patents
Our patent applications cover combinations of particular product candidates and EMM combinations with particular NAFLD/NASH drugs and drug candidates, and some novel EMM compositions. Currently, related patent rights include 2 PCT patent applications. We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire in 2040 and 2041, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Platform-Related Intellectual Property
In addition to the indication-related intellectual property, our intellectual property portfolio also includes know-how and patent applications directed to our development platform and other technologies developed internally. Exemplary platform technologies that are the subject of such patent applications include:
•manufacturing processes for complex EMM compositions (currently 1 U.S. patent application and 18 foreign national patent applications);
•taste formulations (currently 1 allowed U.S. patent application, 1 pending U.S. patent application and 18 foreign national patent applications); and
•unique formulations of candidate compositions (1 U.S. patent application, 1 PCT patent application, and 2 foreign national patent applications).
Our development platform iterates and integrates data from literature, including patents, in vitro experiments, animal studies and our own Clinical Studies, giving us significant competitive advantages. Our development platform, which is protected by trade secrets, is core to maintaining our first mover advantage. These advantages translate into a unique understanding of metabolism, development of many new product candidates, and creation of intellectual property around our product candidates and development platform technologies.
These development platform technologies, and our intellectual property protection related thereto, are broadly applicable to our product candidates. Our patent applications directed to platform-related technologies, if issued, would expire beginning in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extensions we may obtain.
Therapeutic Modality Intellectual Property
Our proprietary knowledge and insights into the behavior of EMMs have yielded inventions related to categories of metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrosis. Our patent applications directed to these underlying modalities, if issued, would expire in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extensions we may obtain.
Table of Contents

We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. We will also prosecute patent applications owned by or co-owned with third party licensors. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we plan to file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, and South Korea.
Individual patent terms depend upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States and most other countries have patent terms that expire 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of a regulatory review period, although patent term restoration in the United States applies to a new chemical entity, so may not apply to some EMM compositions. In Europe, any patentee can obtain a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, on the basis of approval of a therapeutic product covered by the patent based on a full clinical development program. Any restoration period is limited to a maximum restoration time (five years in the United States and Europe) and total effective patent life of the approved drug product (14 years in the United States and 15 years in Europe). The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and local decisions about the validity and enforceability of the patent.

Regulatory Exclusivity
Under certain circumstances, approval of a drug product by a health authority will result in a period of data exclusivity and/or market exclusivity (together considered as regulatory exclusivity) for the product. Data exclusivity means that no party can file for approval of a drug product based on the original drug approval application data. Market exclusivity (such as orphan drug exclusivity) means that the health authority may not be permitted to give final approval to a drug product for a defined period of time, absent certain conditions. In the United States, five-year data exclusivity is only available upon initial approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which may not apply to some EMM product compositions. Moreover, if an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or 505(b)(2) application is filed with a “Paragraph IV certification” referencing a product protected by NCE exclusivity and Orange Book-listed patent(s), FDA may accept such application for filing four years after the reference product’s approval rather than five years. A new drug application with a Paragraph IV certification provides an opportunity for initiating patent litigation, and FDA cannot grant final approval of the application until the earlier of resolution of the patent litigation in the applicant’s favor or 30 months from the Paragraph IV notice date. Three-year market exclusivity may also be granted upon approval of applications (including supplements) containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies), conducted by the applicant and essential to the FDA’s approval of new versions or conditions of use of previously approved drugs, such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or other conditions of use. However, the scope of such exclusivity is generally limited to the particular basis of the approval (e.g., the new indication or dosage form). In the EU, the period of regulatory exclusivity for a drug product approved based on a full stand-alone dossier consisting of quality, pre-clinical and clinical trial data is 10 years, which consists of eight years of data exclusivity which prevent generic applicants from referencing the innovator's data when applying for market authorization and two additional years of market exclusivity where the generic product (even if approved) cannot be marketed until the full 10-year exclusivity or protection period has expired. This 10-year of exclusivity or protection period can be cumulatively extended to 11 years even during the first eight years of the protection/exclusivity period, the marketing authorization holder has obtained approval of one or more new therapeutic indications that are held to bring about a significant benefit as compared with existing therapies. We believe that our products, if approved, should be entitled to the full 10 years of regulatory data exclusivity in Europe. Orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. is seven years. See “Orphan Drug Designation” for further information. Conducting a pediatric study in response to, and in compliance with the conditions of, a written request from FDA extends every form of existing regulatory exclusivity as well as patents by 6 months in the U.S. provided that the data is submitted in a timely manner. For orphan indications, the product is eligible for a period of 10 years of orphan market exclusivity in the EU, during which the EU regulatory authorities are not permitted to accept an application for or approve a "similar medicinal product" in relation to the approved orphan indication. This period can be extended to a maximum of 12 years if the marketing authorization holder has conducted and provided data in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan and has not secured an SPC on the basis of the product approval. Orphan drug exclusivity in Japan is 10 years. 
Trademark Protection
As of December 31, 2021, our trademark portfolio contains more than 50 registrations and pending applications. We have trademarks in over 18 countries, including the European Union. For the marks AXCELLA and the Axcella LOGO, we have International Registrations designating China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia. In the United States we have registrations for the Axcella LOGO and AXCELLA marks, and pending applications for the AXCELLA HEALTH mark.

Trade Secrets
We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and aspects of our development platform. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secret technology, e.g., AxcellaKB, confidential product candidates, and commercial plans in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. To learn more about risks related to trade secrets for our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
Manufacturing
To date, we have rapidly designed and efficiently manufactured product candidates and believe our process is readily scalable. We continue to make enhancements to our product candidates to make them even more patient-friendly, including in their formulation (e.g., taste and texture), packaging (e.g., easy to open sachets) and administration (e.g., water soluble). Our product candidates are supplied in a dry powder form, which is dissolved in water and then administered orally as an orange-flavored drink. Our formulation enables us to deliver high concentrations of dry powder materials at appropriate administration volumes. This covers a wide range of raw material characteristics, and we believe will enable us to deliver multiple oral dosage forms to meet Clinical Study and Clinical Trial needs, as well as commercial needs.
Any product candidates that we decide to develop as drug candidates under INDs will be manufactured at a well-known contract manufacturing organization (CMO) under pharmaceutical current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to produce the dry powder forms in sealed foil sachets. Chemical and microbiological testing of product candidates will be performed by this same CMO per defined product specifications and Certificate of Analysis will be issued for each batch. Chemical and microbiological testing will be performed using validated test methods. We believe these processing steps enable us to readily provide high quality Clinical Trial Material, or CTM, product to support multiple Clinical Trials conducted under INDs and that are readily scalable to support commercial drug product requirements, if any of our product candidates regulated as drugs receive regulatory approval.
Government Regulation
Our ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and potential marketing of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs for initial and subsequent therapeutic indications or commercialization of non-drug products and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA for marketing as a drug in the United States. In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products as well as non-drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution and import and export, of these products. 
For our product candidates developed as drugs, the process required by the FDA before such products can be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
Table of Contents

•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human Clinical Trials may begin;
•approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each Clinical Trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human Clinical Trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other Clinical Trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA, to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potential FDA inspection of the Clinical Trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA and/or us as Clinical Trial sponsor;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA (unless a fee waiver applies);
•agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS);
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources.
Regulation of Drug Product Candidates and Drugs
Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Once a product candidate is identified for development as a drug, it generally enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate the potential for adverse events, which must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data as well as the results of our Clinical Studies, would be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans for a therapeutic indication and must become effective before human Clinical Trials for such purpose may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the Clinical Trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the Clinical Trial can begin. Submission of an IND does not ensure that FDA will allow Clinical Trials to commence at all or on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive Clinical Trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, and IRB approval(s) must be obtained before each Clinical Trial can begin.
Table of Contents

Such Clinical Trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human volunteers under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical Trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the Clinical Trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol for our product candidates which we decide to market through the drug development pathway must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each investigator site proposing to participate in a Clinical Trial must also review and approve the Clinical Trial, including its protocol and informed consent form, before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the Clinical Trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a Clinical Trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing of drug product candidates also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
Human Clinical Trials to support NDAs, for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In certain circumstances, where sufficient evidence of safety and tolerability are collected from preclinical studies and other human experience with a product, subject to discussions and acceptance by the FDA, such as our non-IND human clinical studies, we believe that for the development of such drug candidate, a human Clinical Trial may begin at Phase II, or combined Phase I/II, rather than starting at Phase I. We would expect to discuss with the FDA such proposal to initiate the clinical development program of a drug candidate in a later phase study without first conducting a Phase I Clinical Trial or Trials.
•Phase I — Phase I Clinical Trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase II — Phase II Clinical Trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
•Phase III — Phase III Clinical Trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed Clinical Trial sites. These Clinical Trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and product labeling.
Progress reports detailing the results of the Clinical Trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with Clinical Trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. FDA may require such testing to occur on a lot-by-lot basis in order to release product for clinical use. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including research tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. Clinically superior means that a drug is shown to provide a significant therapeutic advantage over and above that provided by an approved drug that is otherwise the same drug in one or more of the following ways: greater effectiveness than the approved drug, greater safety in a substantial portion of the target populations, and in unusual cases, where neither greater safety nor greater effectiveness has been shown, a demonstration that the drug otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase I, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Table of Contents

Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. In addition, if a sponsor submits an NDA for a product intended to treat certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases or for use as a medical countermeasure for a material threat and that meets other eligibility criteria, upon approval, such sponsor may be granted a priority review voucher that can be used for a subsequent NDA. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Additionally, products for treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the FDA for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
U.S. Marketing Approval for Drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing of our product candidates for drug uses, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and Clinical Trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored Clinical Trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the 60-day filing date for a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. 
Table of Contents

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it historically has tended to follow such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are compliant with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the Sponsor product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more Clinical Trial sites and/or the Clinical Trial sponsor to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and Clinical Trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Table of Contents

Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV Clinical Trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or information on reduced effectiveness, requirements for post-market studies or Clinical Trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. 
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.

Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Factors that payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
•safe, effective and medically necessary; 
•appropriate for the specific patient; 
•cost-effective; and 
•neither experimental nor investigational.
The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the Company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Other Healthcare and Privacy Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
•The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, provide or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order, arrangement or prescription of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute.
Table of Contents

•Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty laws including the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; or knowingly making a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or knowingly concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, with respect to drug products, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product, or promoting a product off-label. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Any future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for drug products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rules published January 2013, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for information related to certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. 
•Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs.
Table of Contents

•Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers
•Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. These laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies implement compliance to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. Data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions may also be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018).
Current and Future Healthcare Reform Legislation
In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business. 
Table of Contents

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” which will shift costs for name brand drugs away from Part D participants back to the manufacturers, which could have a negative effect on our profits in the event any of our products receive FDA approval and CMS reimbursement. Similarly, CMS recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Additionally, CMS has finalized a rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was became effective January 1, 2019.
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
•On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.
•On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.

Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Compliance with Other Federal and State Laws or Requirements; Changing Legal Requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which the Company or its products may be subject.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Other U.S. Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws and Regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.

Foreign Regulations
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, we were subject to MHRA regulations for approval of our clinical trial of AXA1125 in Long COVID. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 27-Member States of the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized procedure or one of the procedures administered by the competent authorities in the EU Member States (e.g. the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology processes, advanced-therapy medicines (i.e. gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines); designated orphan medicinal products or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications, namely the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions. The centralized procedure is optional for products that contain a new active substance for any other indications, which are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and whose authorization would be in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing authorization application is submitted to the EMA where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). A favorable opinion by the EMA typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid across all EU Member States, and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway),  within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” Member States based on an assessment of an application performed by one Member State, known as the “reference” Member State. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference Member State and concerned Member States. The reference Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference Member State’s assessment report, each concerned Member State must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a Member State does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all Member States involved. Where a product has already received a marketing authorization in one Member State, another Member State can recognize that marketing authorization under the mutual recognition procedure.

When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation. This requires among other things, that the prior authorization of an independent Ethics Committee and the submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each Member State before commencing a clinical trial in that Member State. In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on 31 January 2022. It overhauls the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all European Union Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic or biosimilar product. For example, in the EU, if any of our products receive marketing authorization, we expect that we will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of marketing exclusivity. An additional one-year extension of marketing exclusivity is possible if, during the data exclusivity period, we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that is deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EU and prevents generic or biosimilar applicant from referencing the innovator’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of eight years to apply for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization. After eight years, a biosimilar marketing authorization application may be submitted and the sponsoring companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data, but the product cannot be marketed until the expiry of the two-year market exclusivity period. 
As in the United States, a sponsor may apply for designation of a product as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. A product can be designated as an orphan product in the EU if its sponsor can establish: (1) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (i) the prevalence of the condition is not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the product has to be of a significant benefit compared to products available for the condition. Orphan medicinal products in the EU enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication, except for in limited circumstances such as if another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized orphan-designated product.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.

On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. The transition period during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK ended on December 31, 2020. The EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the UK clinical trials legislation is currently based on the now repealed EU Clinical Trials Directive. The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the United Kingdom will mirror the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation that has come into effect is not yet known, however the MHRA has opened a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the United Kingdom clinical trials legislation. Such consultation is open until 14 March 2022. Currently, in order to conduct a clinical trial of a medicinal product in the UK, a clinical trial authorization application must be submitted to and approved by the MHRA. The application must also be approved by an independent ethics committee. The sponsor of a clinical trial in the UK must be established in the UK or the European Economic Area or, if this is not the case, the sponsor must have a legal representative who is so established. 
As a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized EU marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland. A separate marketing authorization is, however, required in order to place medicinal products on the market in Great Britain. On January 1, 2021, all medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure, or ECDRP. Under the ECDRP, submission of a marketing authorization application can be submitted to the MHRA at any time after the approval of an EU marketing authorization, however a delay in submission may affect the delivery of a decision within the specified timelines. Where a submission is made within five days of a positive opinion issued by the CHMP, the MHRA will aim to determine the Great Britain marketing authorization as soon as possible after European Commission approval, and by day 67 at the latest provided that the European Commission decision has been received.
The MHRA also offers a 150-day assessment timeline for all high-quality applications for a UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland marketing authorization. The 150-day timeline does not include a “clock-off” period which may occur if issues arise or points require clarification following an initial assessment of the application.

Human Capital
Our employees are among our most important assets and are key to achieving our goals and expectations. Our human capital resource priorities and competitive equity and cash compensation and benefits programs focus on attracting, recruiting, retaining and incentivizing existing and new employees. We consider our human capital resources strategy to be comprehensive, and we foster strong relationships with and among our employees through ongoing efforts such as employee surveys, training and development programs, regular townhalls, social interactions, and other programs built around our core values: ownership, determination, collaboration, and learning. We plan to continue to evolve and add to our suite of human capital resources as we grow.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 59 full-time employees, 40 of which were engaged in research and development activities and 19 of which were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources, legal functions, or administrative support. More than half of our employees as of December 31, 2021 had obtained Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and most of our employees were based in Cambridge, MA. No employees were represented by labor unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We also engage consultants and temporary workers when needed. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Inclusion & Diversity
We are committed to developing policies that promote awareness and behaviors to ensure fair treatment and equality of opportunity, building a culture of diversity and inclusion, and proactively addressing inequality. In line with our core value of collaboration as noted above, we strive to foster an inclusive culture and actively seek diverse perspectives as we believe diverse experiences and expertise enriches our way of thinking and is essential to achieving our goals. This includes policies and practices that uphold these principles throughout the sourcing, hiring, compensation and assessment of candidates and the retention of our employees. As an example of this commitment, we have joined the MassBio Open Letter 2.0 CEO Pledge for a More Equitable and Inclusive Life Sciences Industry.
Addressing pay equity is important to us. In making compensation decisions, our policy is to not consider race; color; creed; religion; national origin; age; ancestry; nationality; marital, domestic partnership or civil union status; sex, gender, gender identity or expression; affectional or sexual orientation; disability; veteran or military status or liability for military status. We include pay equity as a component during our bi-annual review of all employee compensation plans.
As of December 31, 2021:
•49% of our workforce was female. 
•38% of our workforce was ethnically or racially diverse.
•60% of our Executive Committee members were female.

Compensation & Benefits
Our compensation philosophy is to pay at the fiftieth percentile for most roles. Our compensation package is comprised of three components: base pay, incentive pay and equity awards. For the base pay cash components, we review all salaries twice annually and make adjustments as needed to maintain our position against the market by role. In addition to base pay, all employees are eligible for an annual bonus with amounts determined by a bonus target defined by the level of the role. The third pay component is equity, which is generally granted in the form of stock options that vest over time and is used to incrementally incentivize our employees. Additionally, we offer a competitive benefits package to all of our full-time and part-time (20+ hours/week) employees. 
COVID Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our commitment to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, we activated our applicable business continuity plans, including creating an employee committee under our human resources function to recommend and implement policies consistent with U.S. Government, Massachusetts, City of Cambridge, and industry standard regulations and guidance. In addition, our management, human resource, and legal professionals participated in function networks around the COVID-19 response. 
From mid-March 2020 until early 2022, the vast majority of our employees were working exclusively from home. We recently reopened our office in a hybrid working environment in which employees are able to work in the office and from home. We have put appropriate safety measures in place, including implementing occupancy limits, restricting business travel, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, daily health screening, cleaning and visitor protocols, and easy access to COVID-19 testing. Our measures have been effective to date, and we have had no known infections from exposure at our workplace.

We lease a facility containing 19,200 square feet of laboratory and office space, which is located at 840 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The lease expires in April 2024, subject to an option to extend the lease for an additional three years.
