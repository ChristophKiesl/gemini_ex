Overview
 
The 2020 year was challenging for us. Originally, we set out to provide hydrogen energy systems for residential users. The original business plan, established in April 2016, focused on developing the market for residential off grid hydrogen energy systems while simultaneously acquiring companies that possessed technicians who could be trained in the design and deployment of these hydrogen energy systems.
 
In February 2020, we decided to adopt another approach in market development, which was to pursue the one market that was establishing momentum, hydrogen production on a plant-size scale. In order to achieve our new strategic business model, we decided to sell both our subsidiaries because they were not producing enough profit and were not a strategic fit with our goal of developing the market for hydrogen energy systems. Further, the hydrogen energy market for residential users was not developing at all based on cost inefficiencies, and debt levels were beginning to impact us adversely.
 
Beginning in March 2020, the following steps were undertaken to implement the business transition plan:
 

● | March 2020 - Commenced discussions with investor regarding financing options for our company and strategic acquisitions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | April 20, 2020 - Concluded the disposition of the PVBJ subsidiary 
● | May 2020 - Commenced discussions and diligence for an investment in a hydrogen production project in the Netherlands, known as Volt H2 
● | May 18, 2020 - Concluded the disposition of The Pride Group subsidiary 
● | July 2020 - Concluded 2nd and 3rd tranches of debt financing with proceeds earmarked for an investment in Volt H2. 
● | August 12, 2020 - Concluded acquisition of an equity interest in Volt H2 
● | September 30, 2020 – Moved the Company’s headquarters from Dallas, Texas to Jersey City, New Jersey

● | October 6, 2020 – Changed the company name to Vision Hydrogen Corporation and effected a twenty-for-one reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | January 2021 – Closed on the sale of 12,500,000 shares of common stock in a registered offering, resulting in gross proceeds of $2.5 million. 

 
With the initial investment into the hydrogen production market via Volt H2, the first step in transitioning our hydrogen business focus has been completed. We now will continue to operate the business in a manner that is aligned with our primary hydrogen business strategy.
 
Recent Transactions
 
Sale of PVBJ
 
On April 21, 2020, we sold PVBJ back to PVBJ pursuant to the terms as follows: (a) Benis Holdings applied the $221,800 earn-out liability as consideration towards the purchase of PVBJ; (b) Paul Benis applied the remaining salary due to him, as prorated from the closing date to the expiration date of his employment agreement (January 31, 2021), to the purchase of PVBJ by Benis Holdings as additional consideration thereof, and as a result, we have no further salary obligation to Paul Benis, who resigned as our executive officer; and (c) as additional consideration for the purchase of PVBJ by Benis Holdings, PVBJ assumed responsibility for the line of credit agreement with Thermo.
Sale of Pride
 
On May 18, 2020, we executed the Agreement with Turquino providing for our sale of 100% of Pride’s outstanding stock Pride to Turquino in return for Turquino’s assumption of the $550,000 principal balance of Notes and the debt obligations and accrued interest related thereto. In conjunction therewith, Hidalgo and Doyle assigned the notes to Turquino, at which time Turquino became responsible for the debt obligations under the Notes and we had no further note obligations to Hidalgo or Doyle, and we reduced our debt by approximately $600,000, or 65% of the corporate debt obligations. The Agreement provided that the parties mutually release one another and discharge and release the other party (and their respective current and former officers, directors, employees, shareholders, note holders, attorneys, assigns, agents, representatives, predecessors and successors in interest), from any and all claims, demands, obligations, or causes of action.
Volt Investment
 
On August 12, 2020, pursuant to a Seed Capital Subscription Agreement, we made an equity investment into VoltH2 Holdings AG (“VoltH2”), a Swiss corporation developing scalable green hydrogen production projects primarily in Europe. VoltH2 is currently developing a 25MW green hydrogen production site near Vlissingen, Netherlands. The investment was for a total purchase price $175,000, and we received a 17.5% equity interest in VoltH2.
Name and Symbol Change and Reverse Stock Split
 
We filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State, which as of effective October 6, 2020, changed our name from H/Cell Energy Corporation to Vision Hydrogen Corporation. In addition, pursuant to that amendment, we effectuated a twenty-for-one reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. We believe that the name change better represents our vision for the company and communicates our commitment to hydrogen energy. As well, our stock symbol changed from “HCCC” to “VIHD” effective November 2, 2020. All share and per share amounts in this annual report on Form 10-K reflect the reverse stock split.
Public Offering
 
In October 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whereby we registered 12.5 million shares of our common stock for sale as a company offering. The registration statement was declared effective in October 2020. In January 2021, we sold all of the shares for gross proceeds of $2.5 million.

Market Potential
 
As the world’s fossil fuel supply continually diminishes while causing harm to the planet, we believe that climate hydrogen is the most reliable alternative to carbon fossil fuels, as it leaves zero greenhouse gas residues and can be used at any time of the day or night, as well as in any weather conditions, unlike renewable energy from solar and wind.
 
Hydrogen is fast becoming a significant factor in the planning of future energy production and is anticipated by energy analysts to become more widely competitive as an alternative energy source by as early as 2030 as economies of scale drive-down the cost of fuel cells and electrolysers with the addition of lower costs for wind and solar power. According to the Grand View Research report on future hydrogen growth, published in February 2020, the global hydrogen market is expected to reach $154 billion by 2027.
 
Technology Overview
 
There are great benefits to hydrogen energy. The use of hydrogen as a fuel produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Unlike fossil fuels, the sole emission from hydrogen fuel is chemically pure water. Hydrogen can be extracted from water using renewable energy from the sun and unlike batteries, hydrogen energy can be stored indefinitely. There is no drilling, fracking or mining required to produce hydrogen energy. We believe it is safe and efficient, and the cleanest energy source on the planet.
 
Hydrogen can be produced from a large number of primary energy sources and by various technical processes. Electrolysis is the cleanest option for hydrogen production from renewable resources. Electrolysis is the process of using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Electrolysis occurs through the use of an electrolyzer, which can range in size from a small unit suited for low end hydrogen production to large-scale units for central production facilities that could be tied directly to renewable or other non-greenhouse, gas emitting forms of electricity production.
 
Developments in electrolyzer technology have allowed for a reduction in research and development requirements with a stable network of suppliers for turn-key equipment solutions. The key inputs to hydrogen production are water and electricity supply, as such, proximity to both is essential. Electrolyzers, and the various ancillary components can be purchased from various suppliers as pre-built packages. They will be assembled at our sites with the assistance of the suppliers, but will not require in-house technical knowledge for the assembly.
 
Growth Strategy
 
We intend to aggressively grow our business, through investments and acquisition of strategic target sites. Investment opportunities and target sites will be strategically positioned for power supply, storage, transportation, and fueling infrastructure in geographic regions that have customer and government support for hydrogen markets. Target customers will be industrial users, fleet operators, and various industries looking to replace and/or offset their current carbon-based energy consumption. Delivery and logistics will be unique to each site, but may involve pipeline, rail, and truck supplies.
Competition
 
Given the increasing focus on renewable energy, and hydrogen specifically, to offset the environmental problems caused by fossil fuels, the renewable energy industry is highly competitive, and rapidly evolving. Our major competitors include leading global companies, and other regional and local energy providers.
 
In the markets where we plan to conduct business, we will compete with many energy producers including electric utilities and large independent power producers. There is also competition from fossil fuel sources such as natural gas and coal, and other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. The competition depends on the resources available within the specific markets. However, we believe that our target approach will allow us to compete favorably with traditional utilities and other renewable energy systems in the regions we service.
 
Although the cost to produce clean, reliable, renewable energy is becoming more competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources, it generally remains more expensive to produce, and the reliability of its supply is less consistent than traditional fossil fuel. Deregulation and consumer preference are becoming important factors in increasing the development of renewable energy projects.
 
However, as a company with only a short operating history, substantially all of our competitors have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, technical, management or other resources in particular markets or in general.
 
Government Regulations; Regulatory Matters
 
Given the industrial nature of our planned operations, water access restrictions, and high level of electricity needs, we expect to operate in an area that is highly regulated by local and possibly national government bodies. We anticipate that our operations at will be subject to oversight and regulation at the federal, state and local level in accordance with statutes and ordinances relating to, among others, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections and hydrogen siting. The level of regulation may depend, in part, upon where a system is located.

Other than these requirements, at this time we do not know what additional requirements, if any, each jurisdiction will impose on our operations. We also do not know the extent to which any new regulations may impact our ability to distribute, install and service our products. The federal, state, local or foreign government entities may seek to impose regulations or competitors may seek to influence regulations through lobbying efforts.
 
Government Incentives
 
We intend to focus on states on regions whose government supports a regulatory standard that promotes hydrogen production and consumption. These governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to accelerate and promote the use of hydrogen as renewable energy sources. These incentives may take the form of support for infrastructure and hydrogen transportation versus monetary incentives. For example, in June 2020, as part of its economic COVID-19 stimulus package, Germany announced €9.0 billion of funding earmarked for expansion of hydrogen production. Funding is still to be determined, but specific areas could include, infrastructure conversions and new pipeline development.
Employees
 
As of March 11, 2021, we had two full-time employees, which are our executive officers. We plan to hire employees on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
