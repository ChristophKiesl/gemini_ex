Item 1.    Business 
Overview
We were incorporated in Delaware in April 2018 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Parent under the name HS Spinco, Inc., and subsequently changed our name to Covetrus, Inc. We are a global animal-health technology and services company dedicated to supporting the companion, equine, and large-animal veterinary markets. Our mission is to provide the best products, services, and technology to our Customers across the globe, so they can deliver exceptional care to their Animal Owners when and where it is needed. 
Transactions that formed Covetrus:
Separation. In anticipation of the spin-off, affiliates of Covetrus purchased from certain minority holders their ownership interests in the applicable operating companies of the Animal Health Business. On February 7, 2019, Henry Schein completed the spin-off of its Animal Health Business and transferred the applicable assets, liabilities, and ownership interests to us 
Share Sale. Also, on February 7, 2019 and prior to the Distribution, we sold $361 million in shares to accredited institutional investors. The proceeds from the Share Sale were paid to us and distributed to our Former Parent
Distribution. All the shares of our common stock that were then owned by Henry Schein were distributed to its stockholders of record as of January 17, 2019. Concurrent with the Distribution, we paid a cash dividend of $1.2 billion to our Former Parent from loan proceeds from our newly established credit facility (see Note 7 - Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings, Net)
Acquisition. We then acquired Vets First Choice in an all-stock transaction, and the following day, our shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CVET”
Purpose of founding Covetrus. We combined the complementary capabilities of the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice, bringing together innovative practice management software and supply chain and distribution businesses with a technology-enabled prescription management platform and related pharmacy services.

We are now two years into our three-year strategy, see Our Strategy as discussed below, and we believe our approach to the market supports the delivery of improved veterinary care and the health of our customers' veterinary practices while driving increased demand for our products and services. We believe that building lasting relationships between our Customers and Animal-Owners is an important component to our future success in our three-year stated strategy and beyond.

Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

Our strategic roadmap to an all-in-one solution for the veterinary market prioritizes providing our supply chain services, compounding services, PIMS, and the prescription management platform, all through one operating system. In January of 2022, we announced our veterinary operating system, Covetrus Pulse™, that we expect to launch in our North America segment in the second quarter of 2022. 
Our future success largely depends on our ability to grow and adapt to the changes in the veterinary market. We expect to focus for 2022 and beyond on the faster-paced growth and higher margin areas of our business in our effort to create a similar product, service, and technology offerings across our segments.
Segments
We manage our organization geographically in three reportable segments: (i) North America, (ii) Europe, and (iii) Asia Pacific (APAC) & Emerging Markets. Historically, the business was focused on driving growth through specific product and service offerings to our Customers; the Transactions allowed us to bring together the different products and service offerings, along with prescription management, data analytics, and insights through veterinary practice management software, into one multi-channel veterinary platform. We will continue to focus on delivering this collection of products and services to our Customers on a geographical basis. We disaggregate our net sales based on our major product categories: supply chain services, software services, and prescription management. See below, Item 7- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segments, Note 3 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and Note 2 - Segment Data.
Acquisitions and Divestitures 
Equity Method Investments
In April 2020, we completed the previously announced combination of our subsidiary, SAHS, with Distrivet. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Equity Method Investments.
Acquisitions 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed acquisitions of VCP, a leading platform in veterinary wellness plan administration, and AppointMaster, a provider of integrated communications solutions for veterinary practices, for an aggregate purchase price of $85 million. These acquisitions are intended to provide our Customers with new tools to foster stronger relationships with their Animal Owner clients by delivering better business and healthcare outcomes. See Note 4 - Business Acquisitions.

Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

In October 2020, we announced a strategic investment in VSG which was consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2020. This relationship brings together two highly complementary organizations each dedicated to veterinary practices and committed to driving enhanced patient care, empowering veterinarians to run better businesses, and advocating for the veterinary profession. This investment is an opportunity to accelerate our strategic initiative on driving increased customer alignment. See Note 4 - Business Acquisitions.
Divestitures
In April 2020, we completed the divestiture of our scil business to Heska for approximately $100 million, net of deal-related fees and other transaction items. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Equity Method Investments.
Our Products, Services, and Technologies 
Covetrus exists to help our Customers drive better health for animals and their Animal-Owners as well as business outcomes. We believe the integration of our products, programs, services, and technologies will provide an all-in-one platform for our Customers to utilize across their practices. 

Our current product and service offerings across our segments:
North America Segment: Has the most expansive collection of products, services, and technologies for our Customers and Animal-Owners. In broad categories, we offer supply chain services, software services, and prescription management.
Europe Segment: We offer supply chain services and software services to our Customers and Animal-Owners.
Asia-Pacific and Emerging Markets Segment: We offer supply chain services and software services to our Customers and Animal-Owners. 
Our major products and services categories are described below. See Note 3 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers for a breakdown of our net sales by segment and product or service categories.
Supply Chain Services

Logistics and in-clinic supply | Proprietary Brands | Membership Organizations


Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products, services, and value-added solutions to our Customers for enhancing practice revenue, operating efficient practices, and delivering high-quality animal care. By combining our global scale and logistical expertise with robust software and ordering tools, a broad product offering at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, we strive to be an indispensable and trusted partner for our Customers’ evolving needs. We are also continuing to grow our portfolio of Covetrus-branded and proprietary-branded products. These are products and solutions we develop and manufacture, both in-house and using third party contract to manufacturers, that we market and sell under Covetrus-owned branding. Currently, our main proprietary brands are Vi, Kruuse, SmartPak, and Calibra, along with Covetrus-branded products. 

Software Services

Software and e-commerce | Wellness Plans

We develop, provide, and support veterinary practices with a wide range of veterinary software systems. These technology solutions include practice management software, data-driven applications, client communications tools, and related services, which are designed to increase staff efficiency and improve business health, allowing veterinarians and their staff more time to provide patient care. We also offer solutions that integrate with our software platforms, including client communication services, reminders, data backup services, hardware sales and support, and credit card processing. These integrated veterinary marketing services leverage practice-level data and consumer insights to deliver highly personal, relevant, and timely communications, strengthening the veterinary-client patient relationship and improving Animal Owners' loyalty to their veterinarian. Our payment solutions also help veterinarians save time and money with credit card processing services, which are integrated into our veterinary software systems to streamline workflow.
Prescription Management (currently in our North America Segment only)

Prescription Management


Through the integrated product and service offerings available on our prescription management platform, we seek to enable our Customers to manage the lifecycle of a prescription to create new revenue opportunities, adapt to changing Animal-Owner purchasing behaviors, and strengthen their client relationships through the convenience of our e-commerce, auto-ship services, and access to accredited veterinary pharmacies for standard prescriptions, preventatives, diets, and custom-compounded medications. These products and services ultimately allow our Customers to improve the quality of animal care that is provided.
Our Customers can access our accredited veterinary pharmacies to fulfill compounded, specialty, patient-specific customized medications, and in-clinic use medications through our prescription management platform. As discussed below, our strategy includes investing to further develop the capabilities of our prescription management platform and to grow our high margin custom-compounding medications. 

Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

We are building the infrastructure in the U.S. necessary to support growth of our pharmacy presence. As of December 31, 2021, we own or lease properties which are integral to our global operations as well as necessary infrastructure for our future growth. We also have 503A pharmacies as well as an FDA registered outsourcing facility under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We initiated a legal-entity rationalization in 2021 that was completed in the first quarter of 2022, and as a result of that process we are re-licensing our pharmacies and facility under one legal-entity, Covetrus North America, LLC. Certain of our pharmacies have completed the re-licensing process for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We currently anticipate to complete this re-licensing process in all 50 states in the first half of 2022. Obtaining licensure for our pharmacies is an important factor in our strategic focus for expanding our pharmacy infrastructure. 
Our Customers
Our customer base for our products, programs, services, and technologies is comprised principally of animal-health and veterinary practices and clinics in the companion-animal, equine, and large-animal markets in North America, Europe, and APAC & Emerging Markets. These veterinary practices consist of both small, privately owned businesses and an increasing number of corporate-owned practices. We also serve animal-health providers and producers and pet specialty retail stores. Our major product categories service customers in the following markets:
•Supply chain customers in North America, Europe, and APAC & Emerging Markets
•Software services customers in the U.S., U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and certain other countries
•Prescription management and pharmacy services customers in the U.S
COVID-19 and Our Return to Work 
To protect the health and safety of our employees, we implemented workplace regulations and guidelines recommended from government and public health authorities related to COVID-19. In March 2020, we transitioned a large portion of our teams to working remotely and implemented staggered schedules in our distribution facilities. We created a COVID-19 information portal on our intranet that provides best practices for working at home and staying connected, communications from our leadership team, internal contacts for any COVID-19 questions, and helpful external reference links.
We adhere to regulations and guidelines instituted by local authorities in our areas of operations and make judgments with the best available information at the time. For example, in the U.S., we issued safety protocols for our employees based on their vaccination status. These protocols are applicable for our employees who are working in our offices and facilities as well our employees who are working remotely. 
In our effort to return to work in our offices in 2022, we will be offering hybrid work schedules, to reduce the number of employees in a facility at any given time. The hybrid work arrangement allows employees to split the workweek between remote work on certain days and onsite work on certain days. To support our managers in this hybrid environment, we will provide online training on how to manage remote workers, implement a telecommuting policy, and develop etiquette guidelines for hybrid meetings.
We are continuing to actively monitor how COVID-19 and related variants are impacting our business operation and the industry and may take further actions to alter our business operations in the best interests of our employees, Customers, partners, suppliers, and other stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.

Our Strategy
Our current three-year strategic plan prioritizes the following:

2020 | 2021 | 2022 
Streamline | Synchronize | Accelerate 
Focus Our Business | Harmonize Our Capabilities | Expand Our Offering

Technology Roadmap
Our offerings to our Customers are centered on helping them drive better health and business outcomes in their practices. During 2021, our primary technology focus was on the development of an all-in-one cloud-based veterinary operating system, Covetrus Pulse™, which was announced at the 2022 Veterinary Meeting & Expo and is expected to be released in our North America segment during the second quarter of 2022. Covetrus Pulse™ is intended to unite the applications veterinary practices rely on into one secure cloud platform driving improved efficiencies in business operations, animal health, and client experiences. With Covetrus Pulse™, we expect to enable our Customers to create, renew, and approve prescriptions, communicate with Animal Owners and coworkers, personalize dashboards used in practice management, and customize in-clinic and Animal Owner experiences using a suite of preferred third-party applications. Included within the Covetrus Pulse™ launch for the second quarter of 2022 in our North America segment, are the offerings from our 2021 acquisitions, VCP and AppointMaster. 
Covetrus Pulse™ combines our previously separate offerings in a cloud solution for an easier to use experience for our Customers. For example, an Animal-Owner can book an appointment via our online booking tool. This appointment is followed up with text and email reminders from our communication platform. Once at a Customers' practice, a veterinarian manages this patient using our PIMS which provide medical record storage, treatment paths and workflow solutions. From within the veterinary operating system, at the point of care, veterinarians can proactively prescribe medication and have those medications delivered via our prescription management solution straight to the Animal-Owners home. Through our prescription management solution, Animal-Owners can sign up for auto-ship programs and receive personalized medication from our compounding pharmacy. To drive compliance and provide financial visibility to pet parents, a Customer can enable care plans via our wellness plan administration solution creating a subscription relationship with the Animal-Owner. Then the Animal-Owner can shop online with their veterinarian, our Customer, and manage their prescriptions and communicate with their veterinarian via our telehealth platform.
2021 Organization Harmonization
In order to create “one face to our customer”, we combined our commercial organizations within our North America segment in late 2020, and we completed the integration of these organizations during 2021. We also took similar actions to combine our commercial organizations in our Europe segment, with particular focus on our U.K. and Germany regions during 2021. In addition, we created a global operations enablement function to drive continuous improvement, consistent performance, and improved efficiencies across our segments. 
Accelerating in 2022:
Our strategic priorities in 2022 build on the foundational capabilities we have developed to accelerate our ability to serve Customers through improved and expanded offerings. These key priorities are expected to also drive growth in revenues and operating margin and include:

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had voluntary turnover of 20% as compared to voluntary turnover of 16% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021, we also internally promoted 478 people of our workforce and 756 moved laterally within our organization.
In 2020, we created a global diversity, equity, and inclusion program, which includes a global advisory board and a number of global, business unit, and regional diversity and inclusion leads dedicated to driving our commitments and strategic focus areas as well as to ensure local support. The executive sponsors of program are Sharon Wienbar (member of our Board of Directors) and Ben Wolin (President and Chief Executive Officer). We identified five diversity and inclusion commitments to drive lasting change within five years: (i) diversity-focused recruitment, (ii) diversify the animal-health industry, (iii) employee education and training, (iv) inclusion & employee resource groups, (v) transparency. We are one year into our 5 year diversity and inclusion commitment; and in line with our expectation for public accountability we have disclosed our workforce by gender to drive increased accountability and comparability in future periods.

Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

Occupational Health & Safety
At our facilities, first aid and CPR training is held annually on a volunteer basis to address the safety of employees in the case of emergencies. All Covetrus facilities have standard operating procedures created by dedicated safety committees that address industry best practice, cleaning procedures, site security, equipment, material handling, and use of PPE.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have created subcommittees to review and reinforce PPE use and safety protocols. While health, safety, and quality have always been priorities, an emphasis on hygiene has helped keep our employees safe while at work and at home. Any employee who is re-entering Covetrus office space is required to complete a return-to-work training and COVID safety protocol.
Talent Attraction and Retention 
We design our benefits on the basis of creating rewards programs that support a high-performance culture and attract and retain talent. We also prioritize aligning our high-performance culture with a focus on health. We are driving a clear intention on wellness throughout our organization. Our goal for our employees well-being is that their lives are improved, their lives are healthier, life spans are longer, productivity is increased, and medical claims cost is reduced.
Our offerings to our employees, depending on location, also includes: resilience and wellness training, employee assistance programs, dog-friendly office environments, ESPP, identity theft, and pet insurance. In 2022, we started offering legal insurance to our employees. 
We believe we maintain positive relations with our employees. In certain countries, we are bound by union agreements negotiated by the employer's association with the respective union representatives. We are also party to shop agreements on workplace-related issues, negotiated with works councils at individual facilities that relate to those facilities.
Our Competition
The market for providing products, services, and technology to the global animal-health industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added services, service and delivery levels, credit terms, and customer support. Substantially all of the products we sell are available to Customers from a number of distributors, manufacturers and suppliers and, increasingly, some are being sold directly to Animal Owners and, as a result, significant price reductions by our competitors or changes in how products are ultimately procured by Animal Owners could result in competitive harm.
Our principal competitors include:
•Animal Health Divisions of Traditional Distribution Companies: the MWI Animal Health division of AmerisourceBergen Corporation and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc., and other national, regional, and local full-service distributors
•Animal Health Practice Management Service Providers: IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and several regional and local veterinary software vendors, including those offering cloud-based solutions
•Animal Health-focused E-Commerce Companies: Amazon.com, Inc. and zooplus AG, retail and online pharmacy providers such as Chewy, Inc., PetMed Express, Inc., and Strategic Pharmaceutical Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a Vetsource), as well as manufacturers of animal-health products that sell directly to veterinary practices and retailers, thereby eliminating or reducing the role of distributors
Additionally, the growth in online and brick-and-mortar retailers offering certain animal-health products and services directly to Animal Owners continues to impact our Customers and, in turn, our business given our strategic alignment with the veterinary community. COVID-19 has accelerated this trend. Our operating results may be materially adversely affected should this trend continue to accelerate. 

Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

Seasonality
Our quarterly sales and operating results have varied from period to period in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future. In the companion-animal market, sales of parasite protection products have historically tended to be stronger during the spring and summer months, primarily due to an increase in vector-borne diseases during that time, which correlates with our second and third quarters given that most of our business is in the northern hemisphere. Parasite protection products represented 23% of our net sales in 2021. The following chart reflects our quarterly parasite protection product sales compared to our net sales in 2021.
Buying patterns can also be affected by manufacturers’ and distributors’ marketing programs or price increase announcements, which can cause veterinarians to purchase animal-health products earlier than when those products are needed. This kind of early purchasing may reduce our sales in the quarters these purchases would have otherwise been made. The sales of animal products can also vary due to changes in the price of commodities used in manufacturing the products and weather patterns, which may also affect period-over-period financial results. We expect our historical seasonality trends to continue in the foreseeable future.
Working Capital
Our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs, debt service, strategic investments, and capital expenditures. We require substantial working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations in the level of accounts receivables and inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands throughout the year. We extend credit to many of our customers globally in the ordinary course of business, which increases accounts receivable balances within our business segments and is dependent, to an extent, on seasonal demand. Our sales terms vary from due immediately for credit card payments to significantly longer periods generally offered to larger customers. Inventory purchase activity and stock levels are also dependent on sales activity and seasonal demand, however, on occasion, we consider special inventory buy-in opportunities to achieve better purchase terms and earn larger rebates. 
Laws and Regulations
The sale of certain animal-health products is also governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products.
Our prescription management and pharmacy services business, which currently operates only in the U.S., is regulated by federal and state laws governing, among other things, the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, marketing, and labeling of prescription and non-prescription drugs and related services. In addition, we are subject to FDA, DEA, and comparable state regulations affecting the pharmacy and pharmaceutical industries, including state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards, state and federal controlled substance laws, and statutes and regulations related to FDA approval 

Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

of the sale and marketing of new pharmaceuticals. State pharmacy laws require pharmacies to be licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense prescription medications.
We are authorized to dispense prescription medication in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. As we expand our pharmacy infrastructure, obtaining licensure in all 50 states and the District of Columbia is an important aspect of our growth strategy for higher-margin aspects of our business and delays or failures to obtain licenses may disrupt our near-term strategic objectives. Non-resident pharmacies are licensed similar to resident pharmacies. As such, each prescription for a medication that is fulfilled by one of our pharmacies is generally covered by the laws of the state where the Animal Owner is located. The laws and regulations relating to the sale and delivery of prescription medications vary from state to state but generally require that prescription medications be dispensed with the authorization from a prescribing veterinarian. 
U.S.
FDA - the regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal-health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the CVM housed within the FDA. 
•Generally, all animal-health pharmaceuticals are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be safe, effective, and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
•If the drug is for food-producing animals, potential consequences for humans are also considered
•Animal supplements generally are not required to obtain pre-market approval from the CVM, although they may be treated as a food. Any substance that is added to, or is expected to become a component of, animal food must be used in accordance with a food-additive regulations, unless it is generally recognized as safe, under the conditions of its intended use. Alternatively, the FDA may consider animal supplements to be drugs. The FDA has agreed to exercise enforcement discretion for such supplements if each such supplement meets certain conditions
USDA - the regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary biologics, such as vaccines, is the USDA. 
•The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal-health vaccines, including immunotherapeutics. Marketing of imported veterinary biological products in the U.S. requires a U.S. Veterinary Biological Product Permit. Veterinary biologics are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious, as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. The USDA requires post-licensing monitoring of these products
EPA - the main regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary pesticides is the EPA. 
•The EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals
•Animal-health pesticides are subject to pre-market review and must not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
•Within the U.S., pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies
DEA - under the Controlled Substances Act, distributors of controlled substances are required to obtain, and renew annually, registrations for their facilities from the DEA.
•Distributors are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times
•Distributors are subject to inspection by the DEA
FTC - the FTC regulates advertising pursuant to its authority to prevent “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” under the Federal Trade Commission Act
•Advertising and promotion of animal-health products that are not subject to approval by the CVM may be challenged by the FTC, as well as by state attorneys general and by consumers under state consumer protection laws
•The FTC will find an advertisement to be deceptive if it contains a representation or omission of fact that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is material, and if the advertiser does not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis, such as competent and reliable evidence, substantiating the claim
•The FTC may address unfair or deceptive advertising practices through either an administrative adjudication or judicial enforcement action, including preliminary or permanent injunction
•The FTC may also seek consumer redress from the advertiser in instances of dishonest or fraudulent conduct

Covetrus, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K

State Registration - states may require registration of animal-drug distributors and wholesalers. 
•Additional requirements may apply when the product is also a controlled substance. States work closely with the AAFCO in their regulation of animal food
•The AAFCO’s annual Official Publication contains model animal and pet-food labeling regulations that states may adopt
•The publication is treated deferentially by the federal and state government agencies that regulate animal food. Many states require registration or licensing of animal-food distributors 
•States may also review and approve animal-food labels prior to sale of the product in their state
Rest of world
Country-specific laws have provisions that include requirements for licensing, regulatory approvals, certain labeling, safety, efficacy, and manufacturers’ quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. Many other countries’ regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, European Union regulatory agencies, and other international animal-health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
Other regulations
Through our 503A and 503B compounding pharmacies, we are subject to U.S. anti-kickback statutes. Anti-kickback statutes prohibit among other things the exchange of anything of value, in an effort to induce the referral of business reimbursable by federal health care programs and state health programs. We maintain an annual compliance program to educate our employees on these risks. 
Veterinary compounding pharmacies must remain mindful of compliance with state and federal laws that govern the relationship between pharmacies and referral sources. The AKS imposes criminal penalties against individuals and entities that pay or receive remuneration in return for referring an individual for service paid under a federal health care program. Veterinary compounding pharmacies have historically avoided scrutiny under the AKS because no federal programs are involved in veterinary compounding funding. However, most states have enacted statutes and regulations that mirror the AKS and, in some cases, are even broader than the AKS.
Various states have enacted business and insurance regulations prohibiting referral arrangements that result in the offer or acceptance of any rebate, refund, commission, discount or other consideration as compensation or inducement for referring patients, clients or customers. These regulations often encompass all health-care related professions, including pharmacies and veterinary practices. Penalties for violations of these state anti-kickback regulations may include imprisonment as well as substantial fines.
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. See Risk Factors - We are subject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
