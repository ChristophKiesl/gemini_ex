•Long-term license contracts.
We have approximately 2,500 customers globally. Our customers consist of companies engaged in the process industry and other capital-intensive industries such as energy, chemicals, engineering and construction, as well as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, transportation, power, metals and mining, pulp and paper, and consumer packaged goods.
Industry Background
The process manufacturing industries consist of companies that typically manufacture finished products by applying a controlled chemical process either to a raw material that is fed continuously through the plant or to a specific batch of raw material.
Process industry characteristics and dynamics are complex and the scale of operation is very large; therefore, any small improvement in the high-volume feedstocks used, or to the chemical process applied, for example, can have a significant impact on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of manufacturing operations. As a result, process manufacturers, as well as the engineering and construction firms that partner with these manufacturers, have extensive technical requirements and need sophisticated, integrated software to help design, operate and maintain their complex manufacturing assets. The unique characteristics associated with process manufacturing create special demands for business applications that frequently exceed the capabilities of generic or non-process manufacturing software packages.
Industry Specific Challenges Facing the Process Industries
Companies in different segments of the process industries face specific challenges driving their need for software solutions that design, operate and maintain manufacturing environments more effectively:
Energy. Our energy markets are comprised of three primary sectors: Exploration and Production, also called "upstream," Oil and Gas Production and Processing, also called "midstream," and Refining and Marketing, also called "downstream":
•Companies engaged in Exploration and Production explore for and produce hydrocarbons. They target reserves in increasingly diverse geographies involving geological, logistical and political challenges. They need to design and develop ever larger, more complex and more remote production, gathering and processing facilities as quickly as possible with the objective of optimizing production and ensuring regulatory compliance.
•Companies engaged in Oil and Gas Production and Processing produce and gather oil and natural gas from well heads, clean it, process it, and separate it into oil, dry natural gas, and natural gas liquids in preparation for transport to downstream markets. The processing capacity of oil and gas processing plants in North America has increased significantly in recent years to process the oil and gas extracted from shale deposits.
•Companies engaged in Refining and Marketing convert crude oil through a thermal and chemical manufacturing process into end products such as gasoline, jet and diesel fuels and into intermediate products for downstream chemical manufacturing companies. These companies are characterized by high volumes and low operating margins. In order to deliver better margins, they focus on optimizing feedstock selection and product mix, reducing energy and capital costs, maximizing throughput, and minimizing inventory, all while operating safely and in accordance with regulations.
Chemicals. The chemicals industry includes both bulk and specialty chemical companies:
•Bulk chemical producers manufacture commodity chemicals and compete primarily on price; they seek to achieve economies of scale and manage operating margin pressure by building larger, more complex plants located near feedstock sources.
•Specialty chemical manufacturers, which primarily manufacture highly differentiated customer-specific products, face challenges in managing diverse product lines, multiple plants, complex supply chains and product quality.
Engineering and construction. Engineering and construction firms that work with process manufacturers compete on a global basis by bidding on and executing on complex, large-scale projects. They need a digital environment in which optimal plant designs can be produced quickly and efficiently, incorporating highly accurate modeling, analysis and cost estimation technology. In addition, these projects require software that enables significant collaboration internally, with the manufacturer, and in many cases, with other engineering and construction firms.
Other Industries.  We recently embarked on a new strategy to market our products and solutions to support companies in the pharmaceuticals and metal and mining industries. These industries desire a far more connected digital infrastructure than the one they have now, and are seeking asset optimization solutions that help them improve their processes, reduce costs and improve quality. Companies in the consumer packaged goods, power, and pulp and paper industries are also seeking asset optimization solutions that help them deliver improved financial and operating results in the face of varied process manufacturing challenges.
Organizations in the process industries now also view sustainability efforts as being a more urgent necessity due to a variety of factors including governmental regulations, environmental stewardship, and new market opportunities. Achieving sustainability goals requires organizations to focus on their environmental footprints, which include everything from reducing the use of non-renewable resources, such as water for feedstocks or energy generation, to decreasing carbon emissions related to standard business operations. Key techniques used to meet these goals can include sustainability tracking, enhanced waste management, process intensification, process redesign and making better use of energy and water. AspenTech products are solutions for each of these techniques.
Complexity of the Process Industries
Companies in the process industries constantly face pressure on margins causing them to continually seek ways to operate more efficiently. At the same time, these manufacturers face complexity as a result of the following:
Globalization of markets. Process manufacturers are continuously expanding their operations to take advantage of growing demand and more economically viable sources of feedstocks. Process manufacturers must be able to design, build and operate plants efficiently and economically while managing and optimizing ever broadening supply chains.
Market volatility. Process manufacturers must react quickly to frequent changes in feedstock prices, temporary or longer-term feedstock shortages, and rapid changes in finished product prices. Unpredictable commodity markets strain the manufacturing and supply chain operations of process manufacturers, which must evaluate and implement changes in inventory levels, feedstock inputs, equipment usage and operational processes to remain competitive.
Environmental and safety regulations. Process companies must comply with an expanding array of data maintenance and reporting requirements under governmental and regulatory mandates, and the global nature of their operations can subject them to numerous regulatory regimes. These companies are increasingly relying upon software applications to model potential outcomes, store operating data and develop reporting capabilities in response to heightened scrutiny and oversight because of environmental, safety and other implications of their products and manufacturing processes.
Evolving Workforce. Process companies must adapt to the changing nature of the technical workforce. A generation of highly experienced plant operators and engineers is nearing retirement. New entrants to the workforce must be able to leverage effectively organization knowledge to become productive with far fewer years of experience.
Market Opportunity
Process industries have been focusing on digital transformation initiatives to improve productivity for more than 40 years. In the 1980s, process manufacturers implemented distributed control systems, or DCS, to automate the management of plant hardware. DCS use computer hardware, communication networks and industrial instruments to measure, record and automatically control process variables. In the 1990s, these manufacturers adopted enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems to streamline back office functions and interact with DCS. These systems allowed process manufacturers to track, monitor and report the performance of each plant, rather than rely on traditional paper and generic desktop spreadsheets.
Many process manufacturers have implemented both DCS and ERP systems but have realized that their investments in hardware and back-office systems are inadequate. DCS are only able to control and monitor processes based on fixed sets of parameters and cannot dynamically react to changes in the manufacturing process unless instructed by end users. ERP systems can only record what is produced in operations. Although DCS and ERP systems help manage manufacturing performance, neither of these systems can optimize what is produced, how it is produced or where it is produced. Moreover, neither can help a process manufacturer understand how to improve its processes or how to identify opportunities to decrease operating expenses, or to reduce environmental impact.
As digital transformation initiatives were extended to each aspect of asset operations, the opportunity to optimize across the full asset lifecycle came into focus. Asset optimization software focuses on the optimum design, operation, and maintenance of the manufacturing process; how the design is optimized for optimum operations and reliability, how the process is operated for optimal economic, safety, and sustainable performance, and how the design and operations impact the longevity and reliability of the equipment. By connecting DCS and ERP systems with intelligent applications, asset optimization software allows a manufacturer to make faster economic decisions, resulting in safer, greener, and more reliable asset operations. 
Examples of how asset optimization software can optimize a manufacturing environment include incorporating process manufacturing domain knowledge, supporting real-time decision making, predicting equipment failure, and providing the ability to respond and adapt to operational changes. Furthermore, these solutions can optimize the supply chain by helping a manufacturer to understand the operating conditions in each plant, enabling more efficient and optimized production decisions.
Increasingly, industrial organizations are focusing on how AI can be applied to address domain-specific industrial challenges. They are concentrating on tangible business outcomes from AI-enabled use cases to further validate the case for widespread industrial AI adoption. These initiatives involve shifting from mass data collection to more strategic industrial data management with a specific focus on data integration, mobility, and accessibility across the enterprise. As a result, integrated data management, edge and cloud infrastructure, and production-grade AI environments are in demand to build, deploy and host industrial AI applications at the appropriate speeds and scale.
AspenTech solutions help customers meet these challenges with proven domain expertise and innovative solutions. Our hybrid model methodology and capabilities in particular enhance first-principles driven models with AI. This is important because highly nonlinear processes are very difficult to model using first principles, and our software can model them using machine learning capabilities and insert empirical data models as objects into first principles-driven models to improve accuracy, safety and predictability. 
Process manufacturers employ highly skilled technical personnel specializing in areas such as process design, equipment design, control engineering, manufacturing operations, analytics, planning, scheduling, and supply chain management. To drive efficiency and improve operating margins, these personnel need to collaborate across functional areas and increasingly rely on software to enable this collaboration as well as automate complex tasks associated with their jobs. Process companies must adapt to the changing nature of the technical workforce. A generation of highly experienced plant operators and engineers is nearing retirement. As a result, we believe there is increasing demand for intelligent software applications that capture and automate expert knowledge and are intuitive and easy-to-learn.

In order to reach each of them in an effective, productive and leveraged manner we will increasingly capitalize on digital customer engagement solutions. Using webinars, digital communities, social media, videos, email and other digital means, we seek to engage our extensive user base with targeted messages intended to address the specific needs of each market, customer and user.
Our overall sales force, which consists of sales account managers, technical sales personnel, indirect-channel personnel, inside sales personnel, and marketing personnel, consisted of 543 employees as of June 30, 2021.
Software Maintenance and Support, Professional Services and Training
Software maintenance and support, or SMS, consists primarily of providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades. Customer technical support services are provided throughout the world by our three global call centers as well as via email and through our support website. For license term arrangements entered into subsequent to our transition to a subscription-based licensing model, SMS is included with the license arrangement. For license arrangements that do not include SMS, customers can purchase standalone SMS.
We offer professional services focused on implementation of our solutions. Our professional services team primarily consists of project engineers with degrees in chemical engineering or a similar discipline, or who have significant relevant industry experience. Our employees include experts in fields such as thermophysical properties, distillation, adsorption processes, polymer processes, industrial reactor modeling, the identification of empirical models for process control or analysis, large-scale optimization, supply distribution systems modeling and scheduling methods. Our primary focus is the successful implementation and usage of our software, and in many instances, this work can be professionally performed by qualified third parties. As a result, we often compete with third-party consulting firms when bidding for professional services contracts, particularly in developed markets. We offer our services on either a time-and-material or fixed-price basis.
We offer a variety of training solutions ranging from standardized training, which can be delivered in a public forum, on-site at a customer's location or over the Internet, to customized training sessions, which can be tailored to fit customer needs. We have also introduced a wide range of online computer-based training courses offering customers on-demand training in basic and advanced features of our products directly from within the products. As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of 351 employees in our customer support, professional services and training groups.
Business Segments
We have two operating and reportable segments, which are consistent with our reporting units: i) subscription and software and ii) services and other. The subscription and software segment is engaged in the licensing of process optimization and asset performance management software solutions and associated support services, and includes our license and maintenance revenue. The services and other segment includes professional services and training, and includes our services and other revenue. 
Competition
Our markets in general are competitive, and we expect the intensity of competition in our markets to increase as existing competitors enhance and expand their product and service offerings and as new participants enter the market. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profitability and loss of market share. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Some of our customers and companies with which we have strategic relationships also are, or may become, competitors.
Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services, or other incentives that we cannot match or offer. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. We believe they also have adopted and may continue to pursue more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. For example, some competitors may be able to initiate relationships through sales and installations of hardware and then seek to expand their customer relationships by offering asset optimization software at a discount. In addition, competitors with greater financial resources may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products. Furthermore, we face challenges in selling our solutions to large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions.
We seek to develop and offer integrated suites of targeted, high-value vertical industry solutions that can be implemented with relatively limited service requirements. We believe this approach provides us with an advantage over many of our competitors that offer software products that are point solutions or are more service-based. Our key competitive differentiators include:
•Breadth, depth and integration of our aspenONE software offering;
•Rapid return on investment and increase in profitability;
•Focus on software for the process industries;
•Embedded AI capabilities that create insights, provide guidance, and automate and democratize knowledge;
•Flexibility of our usage-based aspenONE licensing model;
•Consistent global support; and
•Deep domain expertise and AI to deliver Industrial AI.
Proprietary Rights
Our software is proprietary and fundamental to our business. To protect our proprietary technology and brand, and prevent unauthorized use of our software, we rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, license and confidentiality agreements, and software security measures to further protect our proprietary technology and brand. We generally seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into non-disclosure agreements with our employees and customers, and historically have restricted access to our software and source code, which we regard as proprietary information. We have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property and have registered or applied to register some of our trademarks in the United States and in selected other countries. We actively monitor use of our intellectual property and have enforced, and will continue to enforce, our intellectual property rights. In the United States, we are generally able to maintain our patents for up to 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, and to maintain our trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use. 
The laws of many countries in which our products are licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. While we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable, we do not believe that our competitive position in the industry depends solely on obtaining legal protection for our software products and technology. Instead, we believe that the success of our business also depends on our ability to maintain a leadership position by continuing to develop innovative software products and technology.
Our proprietary rights are subject to risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below. You should read that discussion, which is incorporated into this section by reference.
Licenses
In connection with our acquisition of Hyprotech Ltd. and related subsidiaries of AEA Technology plc in May 2002 and the consent decree we entered into with the Federal Trade Commission in December 2004 to resolve allegations that the 
acquisition was improperly anticompetitive, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Honeywell International Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, pursuant to which we sold intellectual property and other assets to Honeywell relating to our operator training business and our Hyprotech engineering software products. Under the terms of the transactions, we retained a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free non-exclusive license to the Hyprotech engineering software and have the right to continue to develop, license and sell the Hyprotech engineering products.
In March 1982, we entered into a System License Agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, granting us a worldwide, perpetual non-exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to use, reproduce, distribute and create derivative works of the computer program known as "ASPEN" which provides a framework for simulating the steady-state behavior of chemical processes that we utilize in the simulation engine for our Aspen Plus product. MIT agreed that we would own any derivative works and enhancements. MIT has the right to terminate the agreement if: we breach it and do not cure the breach within 90 days after receiving a written notice from MIT; we cease to carry on our business; or certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are commenced and not dismissed. In the event of such termination, sublicenses granted to our customers prior to termination will remain in effect.
Employees
As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of approximately 1,897 full-time employees, of whom 863 were located in the United States. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries labor unions or workers’ councils may represent some of our employees. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
