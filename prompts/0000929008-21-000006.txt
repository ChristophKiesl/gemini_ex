On June 22, 2020, WESCO completed its previously announced acquisition of Anixter International Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Anixter”).

On June 23, 2020, Anixter merged with and into Anixter Inc., with Anixter Inc. surviving to become a wholly owned subsidiary of WESCO.
As a result of the Merger, the Company now employs nearly 18,000 people, maintains relationships with approximately 30,000 suppliers, and serves more than 125,000 customers worldwide. With nearly 1,500,000 products, end-to-end supply chain services, and extensive digital capabilities, WESCO provides innovative solutions to meet current customer needs across commercial and industrial businesses, contractors, government agencies, institutions, telecommunications providers, and utilities. WESCO’s innovative value-added solutions include supply chain management, logistics and transportation, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, as well as kitting and labeling, limited assembly of products and installation enhancement. WESCO has approximately 800 branches, warehouses and sales offices with operations in more than 50 countries, providing a local presence for customers and a global network to serve multi-location businesses and multi-national corporations. With nearly 100 years of excellence, we have the expertise to understand customer needs, the broad product and services portfolio to meet them and a customer-first approach to ensure their long-term success.
Business Segments and Industry Overview
As a result of the Merger, the Company now has operating segments organized around three strategic business units consisting of Electrical & Electronic Solutions ("EES"), Communications & Security Solutions ("CSS") and Utility and Broadband Solutions ("UBS").
The following is a description of each of the Company's reportable segments and their business activities.
Electrical & Electronic Solutions
The EES segment, with sales in approximately 40 countries, supplies a broad range of products and supply chain solutions primarily to the construction, industrial and original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") markets. Construction and industrial customers include a wide array of contractors, and engineering, procurement and construction firms for industrial, infrastructure, commercial, and data and broadband communications projects. Specific applications include projects for refineries, railways, wastewater treatment facilities, data centers, security installations, offices, and modular and mobile homes. OEM customers require products used in the manufacturing of automotive, industrial, medical, transportation, marine, military and communications equipment. The product portfolio in this global business includes a broad range of electrical equipment and supplies, wire and cable, lubricants, pipe, valves, fittings, fasteners, cutting tools, power transmission, and safety products. In addition, OEM customers require a reliable supply of assemblies and components to incorporate into their own products as well as value-added services such as supplier consolidation, design and technical support, just-in-time supply and electronic commerce, and supply chain management. The EES segment operates in highly fragmented markets that include thousands of small regional and locally based, privately owned competitors as well as several large, multi-national companies. EES includes the “Electrical and Electronic Solutions” business acquired from Anixter and the majority of the legacy WESCO industrial and construction businesses.
Communications & Security Solutions
The CSS segment is a global leader in the network infrastructure and security markets, with sales to customers across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. The network infrastructure market is comprised of data centers, wireless products and other devices that enable network connectivity and communication. The security market includes video surveillance, fire and intrusion detection, access control and other solutions to maintain protection and safety for customers. Both the network infrastructure and security businesses are large, fragmented and diverse markets which include various industry groups such as technology, finance, telecommunications service providers, transportation, education, government, healthcare and retail. CSS sells products directly to end users or through various channels including data communications contractors, security, network, professional audio/visual and systems integrators. CSS has a broad product portfolio that includes copper and fiber optic cable and connectivity, access control, video surveillance, intrusion and fire/life safety, cabinets, power, cable management, wireless, professional audio/video, voice and networking switches and other ancillary products. In addition, CSS offers a variety of value-added supply chain solutions such as inventory management, product packaging and enhancement, and customized supply chain services. CSS includes the “Network and Security Solutions” business acquired from Anixter and the legacy WESCO data communications and safety businesses.
Utility & Broadband Solutions
The UBS segment, with operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada, supplies electrical transmission and distribution products, power plant maintenance, repair and operations supplies and smart-grid products, and arranges materials management and procurement outsourcing for the power generation, power transmission and electricity distribution industries. The UBS segment also provides value-added safety and technology solutions, which are essential to utility customers. UBS customers include investor-owned utilities, public power companies, and contractors that serve these customers. Investor-owned utility companies provide a combination of electric generation, transmission and/or distribution and are owned by investors or shareholders while public power entities are generally non-profit entities owned by their members or governed by local, state and municipal governments. These two markets serve the vast majority of utility customers in the U.S. and Canada. The UBS segment provides critical components within the core functions of generating, transmitting and distributing electricity. Products include conductors such as wire and cable, transformers, overhead transmission and distribution hardware, switches, protective devices and underground distribution, connectors used in the construction or maintenance and repair of electricity transmission and substation distribution infrastructure and supplies, lighting and conduit used in non-residential and residential construction. The UBS segment combines the “Utility Power Solutions” business acquired from Anixter, the legacy WESCO utility business, the legacy WESCO broadband business and the legacy WESCO integrated supply business.

Business Strategy
We partner with suppliers to transform products and services into cost-effective, innovative supply chain solutions. We help our customers build, connect, power and protect their businesses to improve their operations and the world we live in. We generate significant operating cash flow, which is deployed to fund organic growth opportunities, acquire companies that provide new capabilities for growth and manage our capital structure. Additionally, over the past several years, we have returned cash to stockholders through share repurchases. With our broad portfolio of products, extensive services and insights from data analysis, we expect to grow sales at a faster rate than the industry.
We utilize LEAN continuous improvement initiatives to deliver commercial and operational excellence, and we extend our LEAN initiatives to customers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and supply chains.
Our strategies align around the following six planks, each of which is comprised of a series of initiatives. We expect these initiatives to enable us to meet the current and future needs of our customers, grow our business, and drive value for our shareholders.
Digital Solutions – customer-segment specific digital solutions to unlock and enable growth
Commercial Excellence – build leading commercial capabilities that leverage data, tools and training to manage sales opportunities and customer service
Operational Excellence – use scale and technology to unlock efficiencies in the supply chain
Technology Platform – technologies to support digitizing the business, managing data and data analytics
Organization, Talent and Culture – strengthen the organization and capabilities to lead change
Portfolio and Strategic Mergers & Acquisitions – increase capabilities to drive value creation through acquisitions that consolidate the industry, expand to adjacent products and services categories, and invest in digital technologies and applications to advance the enterprise strategy
In 2020, a key element of executing our strategy was the acquisition of Anixter. The combination of WESCO and Anixter increased the portfolio of products and services to drive commercial excellence. Additionally, the added scale benefit of the combination provides us with opportunities to drive efficiencies in our supply chain and invest in digital solutions and our technology platform to better partner with our suppliers and customers.
Customers
We have a large base of more than 125,000 active customers across commercial and industrial businesses, contractors, government agencies, institutions, telecommunications providers, and utilities.

Competitive Strengths
The competitive environment is highly fragmented with hundreds of distributors and manufacturers selling products directly or through multiple distribution channels to end users or other resellers. There is significant competition within each end market and geographic area served that creates pricing pressure and the need for excellent service. Competition is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, geographic proximity and price. We believe that our broad portfolio of products, customer centered approach, global reach with local expertise, comprehensive value-added services and smart, digital solutions provide distinct competitive advantages.
Broad Portfolio of Products. We partner with industry-leading suppliers to deliver the most trusted brands in the industry. Our broad product offering encompasses automation, broadband, communications, electrical, electronics, energy, lighting, MRO, networking, renewables, safety, security, utility and wire and cable.
Customer Centered Approach. Each of our customers have unique business models, challenges and priorities. Our dedicated technical experts have extensive experience and product knowledge and are committed to providing solutions tailored to their unique needs. With specialized industry knowledge and a focus on the latest technologies, we help design and deploy solutions that address top business priorities.
Global Reach with Local Expertise. Our international operations and global sourcing capabilities enable us to service our customers wherever they may need us. WESCO has approximately 800 branches, warehouses and sales offices with operations in more than 50 countries. Our global distribution network includes 42 facilities that operate as regional distribution centers or large branch locations in key geographic areas in North America, Europe and Latin America. These facilities add value for our customers and suppliers through the combination of a broad and deep selection of inventory, online ordering and next-day shipment capabilities, and central order handling and fulfillment. Our global network allows us to enhance local customer service by tailoring individual branch products and services to local customer needs.
Comprehensive Value-Added Services. We provide a wide range of value-added services, which draw on our product knowledge and logistics expertise, to enable our customers to save time, improve productivity, mitigate risk and increase profitability. Our broad service offering includes installation enhancement, materials management, kitting and labeling, extensive MRO solutions, onsite job trailer solutions, end-to-end supply chain management and project management/execution across the project lifecycle.
Smart, Digital Solutions. Our Silicon Valley innovation center and partnerships with industry-leading technology companies bring unique capabilities in digital and information-based solutions. These solutions include global e-commerce platforms, vendor managed inventory, point of use systems, last mile optimization, supply chain engineering and intelligent automation.

Geography
Our network of branches, warehouses and sales offices consists of 506 locations in the U.S., 154 in Canada, 60 in Europe and the Middle East, 59 in Latin America and 38 in the Asia Pacific region. This includes 42 facilities that operate as regional distribution centers or large branch locations, of which 33 are located in the U.S., six are in Canada, two are in Europe and one is in Latin America. We also sell to global customers through sales offices and branch operations in various locations throughout Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region.
Human Capital
At WESCO, our people and our high-performance culture are our greatest assets. We are committed to continuous improvement and leveraging our diverse and talented workforce in pursuing WESCO’s vision to be the best tech-enabled supply chain solutions provider in the world.
The merger of WESCO and Anixter doubled the Company’s revenue, and significantly increased our employee headcount and global footprint, including the number of countries in which we operate. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had nearly 18,000 full-time employees worldwide, with more than 12,000 in the U.S. and approximately 5,800 in international locations.
Compensation and Benefits Program. WESCO provides competitive compensation and benefits packages in each of our locations around the globe. In the U.S., we provide a comprehensive benefits program that offers choices to fit our employees’ diverse needs including health and disability benefits, paid time-off, life insurance, retirement programs, and access to other services that support health and wellness. We also have an employee assistance program available to our employees and their family members.
Inclusion and Diversity. As part of WESCO's integration with Anixter, we conducted a company-wide culture survey to give all employees a voice in actively shaping the values that will define the combined organization, one of which is inclusion and diversity. The goals of WESCO’s Inclusion and Diversity program are to 1) leverage the unique experiences and perspectives of our talented workforce to support WESCO’s mission, 2) further engage employees and build an inclusive culture, 3) recruit and develop talent that bring new perspectives and thought processes to WESCO, 4) increase representation of suppliers that are owned and operated by teams with diverse backgrounds and 5) support the communities in which we operate.
WESCO has established an Inclusion & Diversity Council comprised of members of our senior management to lead the formation of four Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) that will support four identity groups – women, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), LGBTQ+, and veterans of the armed forces. These BRGs foster a sense of community and inclusion, provide opportunities to network, support advancement opportunities within the organization, and assist with recruiting. The BRGs are global and open to all employees regardless of any aspect of their personal identity.
WESCO has established relationships with several charitable organizations and encourages employees to volunteer in the community by providing one day of paid volunteer time per year. By connecting with and contributing to local charitable organizations, WESCO supports the development of strong, vibrant and diverse communities.
Safety. Safety is a core value of WESCO and we do not tolerate violations of established safety protocol. We are committed to reducing or eliminating health and safety risks through dedicated programs, leadership commitment, and employee involvement. We seek to achieve continuous improvement in the safety of our facilities and injury-leading injury rates.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating changes to ensure a safe operating environment for our employees, and to protect the communities in which we operate. As an essential business, substantially all of our distribution facilities remained open and we implemented additional safety measures for employees doing critical on-site work and required all other employees to work remotely.
Training and Development. WESCO offers several certification and training programs, some of which are required for all employees while others are voluntary or based on job role. The Company offers a tuition reimbursement program to eligible employees to encourage the pursuit of undergraduate and graduate education to prepare employees for expanded roles in the business.
The Company has had a sales development training program in place for over ten years. The program is designed to systematically train and develop new college graduates through on-the-job rotations and cohort learning and development during the first year of employment. Graduates of the program move into various sales and operations roles after completing the one-year program. The Company also sponsors a summer internship program to provide college students with real work experience and give them the opportunity to evaluate different career fields.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, patents and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We currently have trademarks, patents and service marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in various other countries. The trademarks and service marks registered in the U.S. include, among others: “WESCO®”, our corporate logo and the running man logo. The Company's "Anixter" trademark is registered in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions and its "EECOL" trademark is registered in Canada. We have also applied to register international trademarks, patents, and service mark applications in various foreign jurisdictions. While our patents have value, none is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These persons may include former, current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our owned and leased real property may give rise to such investigation, remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws. In addition, anyone disposing of certain products we distribute, such as ballasts, fluorescent lighting and batteries, must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products.
We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws. As a result, we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future.
Seasonality
Our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors. Sales during the first and fourth quarters are usually affected by a reduced level of activity due to the impact of weather on projects. Sales typically increase beginning in March, with slight fluctuations per month through October. During periods of economic expansion or contraction, our sales by quarter have varied significantly from this pattern.
