In this Annual Report, “Alliance,” “Alliance MMA,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Alliance MMA, Inc. Unless specified otherwise, the financial results in this Annual Report are those of the Company and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis.
Overview
 
Nature of Business
 
Alliance MMA, Inc. (“Alliance” or the “Company”) was formed in Delaware on February 12, 2015 to acquire companies in the mixed martial arts (“MMA”) industry. We intend to create a highly organized feeder organization to the sport's highest level of professional competition including The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Bellator MMA, World Series of Fighting and other prestigious MMA promotions worldwide. The Company plans ultimately to promote over 125 domestic events per year, showcasing more than 1,000 fighters, through regional promotions operating under the Alliance MMA umbrella.
 
On September 30, 2016, Alliance completed the initial public offering of its common stock and acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of six companies. Additionally, we acquired the seventh company, Go Fight Net, Inc. (“GFL”) through a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alliance, GFL Acquisition, Co., Inc. (“Acquisition Co”), also on September 30, 2016. The seven companies consisted of five regional MMA promotion companies, a live MMA video promotion and content distribution company, and an electronic ticketing platform serving MMA and other combat sports events (we refer to these seven companies as the “Target Companies” for all periods prior to September 30, 2016, and as the “Initial Business Units” after such date). The Initial Business Units comprise many of the premier regional MMA promotions in the United States, with CFFC and Hoosier Fight Club ranked among the top 40 of all regional MMA promotions internationally. On a collective basis, these promotions have over 65 professional MMA fighters under multi-fight contracts, and have sent over 50 professional MMA fighters to compete in UFC events. Many of the Initial Business Units’ events are televised on cable and network stations or streamed live via the Internet.
 
By joining Alliance, smaller promotions become partners in a much larger organization that intends to enhance collective market share and profitability of the businesses through increased ticket sales, incremental events, centralization of certain common business functions, and the application of best business practices across the enterprise.

Acquisition of the Acquired Assets
 
In addition to the acquisition of the Initial Business Units, we also acquired the MMA video libraries of two prominent regional promotions (which we refer to as the “Target Assets” for all periods prior to September 30, 2016, and the “Acquired Assets” after such date). The video libraries consist of the following:
 
Ring of Combat, LLC (“Ring of Combat”) – based in Brooklyn, New York, and founded by MMA icon and three-time World Kickboxing Champion Louis Neglia (34-2), Ring of Combat is currently ranked as the No. 4 regional promotion in the world by Sherdog.com, a website devoted to the sport of mixed martial arts that is owned indirectly by Evolve Media, LLC. According to Sherdog.com, its rankings are determined by several factors including (i) the size of the shows put on by the regional promotion, (ii) the quality of fighters affiliated with the promotion, (iii) the number of fighters that matriculate to the UFC and other premier promotions such as Bellator MMA, (iv) the success those fighters have once elevated to the UFC and such other premier promotions, and (v) whether the promotion has a television or other media arrangement in place.

On September 30, 2016 we acquired the exclusive rights to the Ring of Combat video library, which included professional MMA, amateur, and kickboxing events and covers approximately 200 hours of video content. Ring of Combat has sent approximately 90 fighters to the UFC including UFC World Champions Matt Serra (11-7), Frankie Edgar (19-4), and Chris Weidman (13-0), whose fights are included in the Ring of Combat fighter library. With the acquisition we also secured the media rights to all future Ring of Combat promotions.
 
Hoss Promotions, LLC “Hoss” – an affiliate of CFFC, Hoss owned the intellectual property rights to approximately 30 MMA events promoted by CFFC. On September 30, 2016, we acquired the exclusive rights to the Hoss video library, which covers approximately 100 hours of video content.
 
Consideration Paid to Target Companies, Hoss and Louis Neglia; Contingent Consideration
 
The aggregate consideration paid to acquire the businesses of the Target Companies and the Target Assets was approximately $7.8 million, consisting of cash in the amount of $1.6 million, and shares of our common stock with a market value of $6.2 million based on the price at which our common stock was sold in our initial public offering of $4.50 per share. With respect to each Target Company other than GFL, the purchase price will be adjusted upward in the event that, during the twelve-month period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017, such Target Company exceeds certain gross profit thresholds agreed upon by us and the Target Company. The upward adjustment to the purchase price will be a multiple of seven times the amount by which actual gross profit exceeds the agreed-upon gross profit threshold. As of December 31, 2017, management has determined that it’s unlikely these thresholds will be met and, therefore, the earn-out liability was adjusted to zero. If any of the Target Companies were to meet the applicable threshold,, the additional consideration would result in an increase in the purchase price, would be paid following the filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018 in shares of our common stock valued at the lesser of (i) the initial public offering price of $4.50 and (ii) the average of the closing trading price for our stock over the 20 trading days prior to the date on which we file such Form 10-Q.
 
We valued the business of each Target Company using a number of factors including historical and projected future profitability and expectations of the business of each Target Company under the Alliance brand. Factors we considered include, but are not limited to, current financial position, professional fighter rosters, customer and venue arrangements, media library and other intellectual property rights, prominence in the MMA industry, nature and extent, if any, of sponsorships, television and pay-per-view arrangements, and other relevant characteristics. During our assessment of each Target Company, we recognized that the majority of value resided in the ability of the promoters to establish credible customer and venue relationships, the breadth of each promotion’s video library and related intellectual property rights and, in the case of CageTix, its proprietary ticketing software which we intend to leverage across our platform. While each promotion brings a unique value proposition on a stand-alone basis, we believe that on a combined basis significantly greater value can be realized, particularly in the areas of television and media sponsorship.
 
Structure of Acquisitions
 
Although each acquisition agreement contained slightly different terms, we generally acquired the MMA video library and tangible assets of each of the Target Companies, but not their debt. The acquisition of GFL was structured as a merger and we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of GFL in consideration for cash and shares of our common stock. Alliance MMA, the Alliance MMA logo, and SuckerPunch are trademarks of the Company. We have licensed the trademarks of the Target Companies under perpetual, royalty-free licenses that may be terminated only in the event of a material uncured breach of the respective agreement by us.
 
Summary of the Terms of the Acquisition Agreements
 
Although the following summarizes the material terms of the acquisition agreements, it does not purport to be complete in all respects and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the acquisition agreements, a copy of each of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement for our initial public offering. Additionally, the following summary discusses the acquisition agreements in general terms and does not identify the instances where one acquisition agreement may differ from another. Other than the amount of consideration to be received, all of the acquisition agreements are substantially similar.
 
Executive Employment Agreement and Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements
 
In connection with the acquisitions of the Target Companies, each of the principal equity holders of the Target Companies entered into an employment agreement with us where such individuals now serve as our regional General Managers. Certain individuals who were previously associated with Target Companies were offered corporate positions including Rob Haydak who serves as our President, Michael Constantino who serves as Director of Business Development, Jason Robinett who serves as our Chief Technology Officer, and GFL’s David Klarman who serves as Vice President of GFL. Each employment agreement is for a three-year term, and provides for base compensation and discretionary bonuses. We may terminate an employee for cause, which includes gross negligence or willful misconduct, or without cause. Where the employee elects to terminate their agreement, where he or she is terminated by us for cause, or in the event of his or her death or disability, we will provide salary and benefits under the terms of the agreement up to the date of termination. In circumstances where we elect to terminate an employment agreement without cause, we will continue to pay his or her salary through the end of the term of the applicable agreement in accordance with our customary payroll practices.
 
In addition to executive employment agreements, each employee entered into a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement that contain restrictions prohibiting such person from soliciting our employees or conducting a competitive business in the MMA industry for a period ranging from one to three years after the termination of such executive’s employment with us for any reason. With respect to the non-competition and non-solicitation agreement we entered into with COGA’s Joe DeRobbio, the non-competition and non-solicitation prohibitions continue for a period of two years after termination of employment other than where we terminate Mr. DeRobbio without cause. With respect to the non-competition and non-solicitation agreement we entered into with Shogun’s John Rallo, the non-competition and non-solicitation prohibitions are for a period of one year after termination of employment with cause.

Trademark License Agreement
 
Upon the acquisition of each Target Company on September 30, 2016, we entered into a trademark license agreement with such Target Company, other than CageTix whose trademark rights were purchased, pursuant to which we licensed the trademarks used by the Target Company in connection with the MMA promotion business we acquired. Each agreement provides that the trademarks are licensed on an exclusive, perpetual, fully-paid, royalty-free basis and may be terminated by the licensor only in the event of our material uncured breach or under circumstances where we terminate the regional vice president without cause.
Initial Public Offering (“IPO”)
 
Alliance completed the first tranche of its initial public offering on September 30, 2016, with the sale of 1,813,225 shares of common stock with net proceeds of $7,732,280, and closed the acquisitions of all the Target Companies and Target Assets of Hoss Promotions and Louis Neglia’s Ring of Combat. The Company completed the offering in October and sold an additional 409,083 shares with net proceeds of $1,168,861. The offering was underwritten on a best-efforts basis by Network 1 Financial Securities, Inc.
 
The combination of the Target Companies and Target Assets formed our initial operations. We intend to acquire additional regional promotions over time to create a developmental league for professional MMA fighters to showcase their athletic skills with the intent of eventually graduating to compete at the highest level with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”), and other premier MMA promotions such as Bellator MMA. The combination of the acquired promotions will allow the Company to identify and cultivate the next generation of UFC and other premier MMA promotion champions, while at the same time create live original media content, attract an international fan base, and generate sponsorship revenue for the Company’s live MMA events and professional fighters.
 
The Company incurred an aggregate $4,545,850 net loss from inception to September 30, 2016, $2,595,000 of which was related to non-cash compensation in the form of shares of our common stock, which is non-recurring. To fund the Company’s startup expenses, a loan agreement was entered into with a related party, Ivy Equity Investors, LLC, in February 2015 for up to an initial $500,000 of borrowings. In May 2016, the loan agreement was amended to permit up to $600,000 of borrowings for startup expenses and in July 2016 the loan agreement was amended again to permit up to $1,000,000 of borrowings. Upon the completion of the IPO, approximately $877,000 of the proceeds were used to pay off the current balance of the note payable and accrued interest.
 
For accounting and reporting purposes, Alliance has been identified as the accounting acquirer of each of the Target Companies. In addition, each of the Target Companies has been identified as an accounting co-predecessor to the Company.
 
Subsequent Acquisition of IT Fight Series, Fight Time Promotions and SuckerPunch Entertainment
 
In addition to the acquisition of the Initial Business Units, on December 9, 2016, the Company acquired the Ohio-based MMA promotion business of Ohio Fitness and Martial Arts, LLC d/b/a Iron Tiger Fight Series (“IT Fight Series”) for an aggregate consideration of $656,665, of which $150,000 was paid in cash and $506,665 was paid with the issuance of 133,333 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $3.80 per share. In connection with the acquisition, Scott Sheeley, the sole owner of IT, placed 50,000 shares of the 133,333 shares of common stock issued as part of the purchase price into escrow to guarantee the financial performance of the IT MMA promotion business post-closing. Accordingly, in the event the gross profit of the IT Fight Series MMA promotion business is less than $107,143 in fiscal year 2017, all 50,000 shares will be forfeited.
 
IT Fight Series was founded by Mr. Sheeley in 1995, and currently hosts approximately ten MMA promotions per year in various cities throughout the Ohio region. Since launching its inaugural event in 1995, IT Fight Series has promoted more than 70 shows and has promoted more than a dozen fighters who went on to compete at the highest level of professional MMA competition with including the UFC, Bellator MMA and other premier promotions. Mr. Sheeley is a former professional fighter with over 40 bouts and 25 years of experience in various styles of martial arts. He has appeared in several major motion pictures, and has created and operated a number of successful business ventures outside of his MMA promotion.
 
On January 24, 2017, the Company acquired the MMA promotion business of Fight Time Promotions, LLC (“Fight Time”), for an aggregate consideration of $362,508, of which $84,000 was paid in cash and $278,508 was paid in shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $3.73 per share. In connection with the acquisition Karla Guadamuz-Davis, the sole selling member of Fight Time, placed 28,000 shares of the 74,667 shares of common stock issued as part of the purchase price into escrow to guarantee the financial performance of the FT MMA promotion business post closing. Accordingly, in the event the gross profit of the Fight Time MMA promotion business is less than $60,000 in the twelve months following the closing, all 28,000 shares will be forfeited. Also in connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a two-year executive employment agreement with Ms. Davis who will serve as General Manager, Fight Time Promotions. Ms. Davis will receive base compensation of $40,000 per year under the agreement.
 
Founded in 2010 by Ms. Davis and her late husband, Olympic Gold Medalist Howard Davis Jr., Fight Time has produced 34 events in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, many of which have been featured on the CBS Sports Network, Comcast Sports Net, and HBO Plus. Co-Founder Howard Davis Jr. was the 1976 boxing Olympic lightweight gold medalist, the first fighter to win the New York Golden Gloves 4-times in a row, and was awarded the Val Barker Trophy for being the most outstanding boxer of the 1976 Olympics, beating out teammates Sugar Ray Leonard and Michael Spinks.
 
On January 4, 2017 the Company acquired Roundtable Creative Inc., a Virginia corporation d/b/a SuckerPunch Entertainment, a leading fighter management and marketing company (“SuckerPunch”) through a merger between SuckerPunch and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for an aggregate consideration of $1,350,000, of which $300,000 was paid in cash and $1,050,000 was paid in shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $3.74 per share. SuckerPunch was the surviving entity in the merger. In connection with the acquisition, Brian Butler-Au, the sole stockholder of SuckerPunch, placed 108,289 shares of the 280,749 shares of common stock issued as part of the merger consideration into escrow to guarantee the financial performance of the SuckerPunch business post-closing. Accordingly, in the event the gross profit of the SuckerPunch business is less than $265,000 in the twelve months following the closing, all 108,289 shares will be forfeited.
 
Headed by Mr. Butler-Au and Bryan Hamper, SuckerPunch is a leading MMA fighter management and marketing company. SuckerPunch works with matchmakers at the UFC and other top-tier promotions to deliver top MMA talent. In some cases, regional talent is delivered to these premier promotions by Alliance MMA fight promotions, specifically when those athletes are ready for global contracts, thereby avoiding conflicts in representation. Since 2007, SuckerPunch has managed several Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) titleholders including Joanna Jedrzejczyk, Jens Pulver, Carla Esparza and, most recently, Max Holloway.
 
Company Organizational Infrastructure
 
At the closing of the IPO in October 2016, the Company was faced with the task of quickly integrating the Initial Business Units and the Acquired Assets in order to ensure the newly-formed business was able to commence functioning as a single, coherent enterprise. Towards that end, the Company endeavored to form a corporate organization designed to support attaining its stated objectives by making a significant investment in recruiting human capital. As of the date of this filing, Alliance has successfully attracted and retained a number of senior-level, highly experienced personnel whose respective skills and expertise are now being applied to ensure the greatest likelihood of achieving positive outcomes. A sampling of these key hires include:
 
Eric Del Fierro was named General Manager of Alliance MMA’s San Diego operations in October 2016. The greater San Diego area is an epicenter of fascination for the MMA sport, and is a critical major market for the Company. Throughout his distinguished MMA carrier, Mr. Del Fierro has coached more than 50 UFC fighters including Bantamweight Champion Dominick Cruz, Phil Davis, Brandon Vera, Cat Zingano, Jeremy Stephens and Alex Gustafsson. Mr. Del Fierro was also co-owner of Total Combat, a regional MMA promotion that produced 35 MMA events over a period of six years, including a performance in Mexico City that attracted more than 15,000 spectators.
 
James Platek was recruited in October 2016 as the Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Platek has more than 25 years of finance, investment and capital markets experience with leading asset management, financial services and investment banking firms, including Northeast Securities, Millennium Management and Fieldstone Capital Group. His seasoned background affords Mr. Platek the ability to clearly communicate the Company’s investment thesis to a broad investment audience, while leveraging his significant buy-side investor relationships, particularly in hedge fund, family office and asset management, to the Company’s advantage.
 
Jason Robinett joined the Company in November 2016 as our Chief Technology Officer. His assignment involves creating a fully integrated IT infrastructure that first merges the existing capabilities of Alliance's CageTix electronic ticketing platform with its Go Fight Live! (GFL) video production and content distribution operation, then based on a comprehensive technology roadmap, expand interoperative functionality between the two related businesses with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Additionally, Mr. Robinett will participate in Alliance's current implementation of Microsoft Dynamics NAV, a highly adaptable, cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution to address the company's promotional event operations, corporate purchasing, enterprise operations, accounting, tax, audit, and regulatory compliance requirements. The objective is to standardize and simplify the accounting data input function to streamline operational reporting, and to provide our Geneal Managers and corporate management with meaningful, near real-time performance metrics to assist in better managing event operations. Prior to joining Alliance, Mr. Robinett was previously employed by Expedia where he served as their Chief Information Security Officer overseeing the design and implementation of the company's first information security program, and Watermark Estate Management Services, a private entity that oversees many of Bill Gates' personal and family matters, as their Director of Technology Services.
 
Ira Rainess, a highly regarded sports marketing expert, was retained by Alliance MMA in November 2016 to focus primarily on athlete contracts and sponsorship agreements. Rainess’ unique major league sports experience working with sports icons including Cal Ripken, Jr. and Ray Lewis, along with corporate partners including Red Bull, EA Sports, Pepsi-Cola, Nike and Under Armour, will be relied upon as Alliance MMA continues acquiring regional promotions in major markets across the country. Rainess will collaborate with corporate counsel to provide strategic perspective on several aspects of the talent organization, and will assist in optimizing existing and future third-party relationships.
 
Scott Viscomi, a veteran of combat sports marketing, joined the Company in December 2017 as Director, Event Sales & Marketing. In this essential role, Viscomi is assigned to work closely with the Company’s General Managers to create incremental revenue through local and regional sponsorships, which in turn will assure we are maximizing the profitability of each of our promotions. He has an extensive background in sales and business development, and a successful track record of driving incremental revenue, most recently serving as the Managing Director USA of Adidas Combat Sports.
 
Scott Sheeley, an accomplished professional martial artist and former owner of Iron Tiger Fight Series, was appointed Director for Emerging Markets in February 2017. In this capacity, Mr. Sheeley will capitalize on his extensive off-shore experience and personal network to form a foundation on which the Company expects to generate additional revenue streams outside of the United States. While Alliance’s near-term plan is to first secure a persistent presence in the top 20 domestic media markets, our longer-term intent is to begin simultaneously exploring emerging market opportunities outside the United States. Towards that end, the company intends to make the necessary investment in Mr. Sheeley’s position now in order to capitalize on his international industry experience and vast personal contacts, recognizing and acknowledging pursuit of those business opportunities overseas typically takes time and patience. As such Alliance MMA is initiating action now in order to be ready to execute such prospective endeavors once our local objectives have been successfully attained.
 
James Byrne joined Alliance MMA in February 2017 in the capacity of Chief Marketing Officer. His background has been spent primarily in arena sports marketing working closely with some of sports storied impresarios including both Vince McMahon as the senior marketing executive for World Wrestling Entertainment during the “Attitude Era,” and more recently working alongside Dana White and Lorenzo Fertitta in the same capacity for the Ultimate Fighting Championship organization. Mr. Byrne most recently served as Chief Marketing Officer for Glory Sports International, headquartered in Singapore, where he succeeded in securing kickboxing’s place in the worldwide fight sport ecosystem. Mr. Byrne’s responsibilities at Alliance include creating a an effective brand strategy for the enterprise, securing national brand sponsorships, and leveraging all of the company’s assets to create desire among the fight-consuming public for all of the Company’s products and services.

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to identify and cultivate the next generation of fighters and champions for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and other prestigious MMA promotions worldwide. With some of the leading regional MMA promotions under the Alliance MMA umbrella, we aim eventually to host in excess of 125 live MMA events per year, showcasing more than 1,000 fighters. We are also dedicated to generating live original sports media content, attracting an international fan base, and securing major brand sponsorship revenue for live MMA events, digital media and Alliance MMA fighters. To achieve these objectives, we intend to employ the following strategies:
Acquiring Additional Regional Promotions and Expanding Existing Promotions
 
The Company expects to acquire up to 12 additional MMA promotions over the next eight months and to increase the number of events that our existing seven regional promotions presently conduct. It is our intention to host approximately 125 events over the next 12 to 18 months in top media markets across the US.
Licensing our Original Content
 
We intend to leverage the existing MMA fight media libraries of the Initial Business Units, including the GFL media library which has over 10,000 hours of original fight content, to create programming that we will offer through the www.gfl.tv website as well as through other distribution arrangements. We believe this content has value that has not been monetized primarily due to the limited financial resources of the Initial Business Units on a stand-alone basis. The media libraries of the Initial Business Units contain valuable footage of the determining bouts of many MMA stars from early in their professional careers. The UFC has recognized the value in historic MMA content and recently launched its UFC Fight Pass subscription service that complements its live event and pay-per-view business. We also intend to produce original MMA programming at MMA events that we promote, and monetize this content through domestic and international distribution arrangements. Several of the Initial Business Units have established live and delayed television arrangements with a variety of networks, including CBS Sports Network and Comcast Sports Net.
Obtaining National Sponsorships
 
Presently, the Initial Business Units rely primarily on local and regional sponsors for their live events, although several have established sponsorship and advertising arrangements with larger organizations such as Adidas, MHP and Bud Light. We are in discussions with several prominent sports marketing agencies experienced in identifying, negotiating and procuring sponsorship agreements between mixed martial arts fighters and prospective sponsors, and are presently working to increase sponsorship revenue at each of our events. We are also interviewing several prominent sports marketing and advertising firms with a view towards increasing or expanding existing regional sponsorship arrangements.
Increasing Profitability Through the CageTix Ticketing Platform
 
As is customary in the MMA industry, the fighters appearing on an event fight card will sell a majority of the tickets sold for that event, an amount that routinely exceeds 70% of total live gate ticket sales. Referred to as “fighter consigned” tickets, sales are generally made in face-to-face cash transactions. Often, ticket proceeds are delivered to the regional MMA promoter on or close to the day of the event, making forecasting and budgeting difficult. Since the acquisition of CageTix, we have aggregated control of the ticketing sales chain by instituting the use of the CageTix platform across all of the Target Companies. We believe that using CageTix will allow us to increase the profitability of the Acquired Business’ events, while capturing valuable demographic customer information that will facilitate subsequent sales and marketing efforts. Utilizing proprietary software that is formatted to accommodate a range of mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, Android), the CageTix platform can significantly enhance promoter profitability by offering the security of credit/debit card sales processing; immediate revenue recognition; real time sales reporting; and sales audit and compliance tracking for taxing and regulatory authorities.

Securing More Favorable Event Venues
 
We intend to migrate the MMA promotional events of certain Initial Business Units from paid event venue arrangements to venues that will compensate the promotions for hosting events, such as community sponsored civic auditoriums and casino venues. We expect that the relocation of the Target Companies to paid venues will increase our profitability.
Identifying and Signing Top Prospects
 
We intend to continue the Initial Business Units’ history of securing highly-regarded professional fighters to multi-fight agreements, arrangements which will enhance our reputation and the value of our live MMA programming content. By conducting a greater number of professional MMA events than other regional promotions, and by televising these events, we are able to provide prospects with multi-fight opportunities and the visibility they seek when affiliating with a promotion. Currently, CFFC has over 50 professional fighters signed to exclusive multi-fight contracts including Shane Burgos, Jared Gordon, and Dominic Mazzotta, whose professional records are 7-0, 10-1, and 11-1, respectively. Hoosier presently has over ten professional fighters signed to exclusive multi-fight promotional agreements, including top prospects Nick Krauss, Kevin Nowaczyk, Joey Diehl and Cole Wilken. By leveraging the relationships of our management team and members of our Board of Directors with top training camps, including Blackhouse MMA, American Top Team, Blackzilians, the Gracie family, Jacksons MMA, Chute Boxe, Octagon MMA, and 4oz Fight Club, we anticipate that we will be able to identify top prospects who will help ensure successful events and establish long-term relationships with the UFC and other leading MMA promotions.
 
We intend to continue to acquire, on a selective basis, additional profitable regional MMA promotions in markets where we currently do not promote events. We believe that the regional MMA industry is oriented toward consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through further acquisitions as well as by organically growing our existing MMA promotions. According to the Association of Boxing Commissions, there are presently more than 1,160 registered MMA promoters in the United States and we believe this number exceeds 8,000 worldwide. We estimate that no one promotion has more than a 1% share of the market. We further believe that regional MMA promoters are finding it increasingly difficult to attract the best prospects given the level of competition among regional MMA promoters. Since we anticipate promoting over 65 events annually and sending a significant number of fighters to elite promotions such as the UFC and Bellator, we expect to be able to guarantee multiple fights to top prospects, thereby attracting high-quality fighters. 
 
Providing Clear Direction and Support to our General Managers
 
In most cases, each General Manager associated with a particular promotion was once its owner. As such they have unique strengths and insights and a pronounced ability to share best practices with each other. This cross-collaboration is highly encouraged. In addition to working with their respective state athletic commissions, the Company’s General Managers are given latitude to pursue opportunities in their market with sponsorship, venue selection, matchmaking and event promotional plans tailored to their special needs. With the availability of Alliance resources, many back office and administrative tasks are minimized or eliminated altogether. The resources for the General Managers include access to centralized functions including a marketing department for planning and strategy, and an executive producer for content generation.
Competition
 
The market for live and televised MMA events and for MMA video content is extremely competitive.

Despite the competition we face, we believe that our approach of combining multiple regional MMA promotions under one umbrella organization enables us to leverage the collective resources and relationships of these promotions to address these competitive factors more effectively. In addition, our multi-regional and anticipated international presence will enable us to offer sponsors and media outlets a broad geographic footprint in which to market products, services and content.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our MMA events are regulated at the state level by the athletic commission in each state where our promotions are conducted. The boxing commissions are concerned primarily with the introduction and enforcement of safety rules and oversee MMA in much the same way as they do boxing.
Intellectual Property
 
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements and work for hire agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our websites’ terms of use.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have an application pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to register the Alliance MMA name and also maintain a catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights to television programming and photographs. We received an initial office action from the USPTO contesting our application to register the Alliance MMA name on the basis that the name appears descriptive. We are contesting this initial office action and believe we will ultimately prevail in securing a registration, but there can be no assurance we will. We also own a number of domain names including, alliancemma.com, gfl.tv and the domain names of each of the Initial Business Units promotions.
 
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we seek protection of our marks or our copyrighted works. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights may harm our business or our ability to compete.
 
Seasonality
 
The Initial Business Units have historically experienced a negative seasonal impact on revenues during the months of June, July and August due to reduced attendance at scheduled events. In order to avoid unprofitable financial results, the Initial Business Units generally elect to forgo scheduling events during this period.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2015, we had no employees. Following the acquisition of the Target Companies and additional hires, we had 36 employees as of April 10, 2017.
 
Facilities
 
We do not own any real property. Our principal executive offices are located in New York, New York, which includes approximately twenty thousand square feet of shared office space and services that we are leasing. The original lease had an one-year term that commenced on December 1, 2015, which was renewed until November 30, 2017. There was a single Target Company lease that we assumed when we purchased the related business. We terminated this lease in January 2017. In November 2016, we entered a sublease agreement for office and production space in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The lease expires on June 30, 2019.Legal Proceedings
 
We are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings. We may, from time to time, become a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of our business. As our growth continues, the number of litigation matters and claims to which we may become a party may also increase. The outcome of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and the resolution of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
