ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
TimkenSteel Corporation (we, us, our, the Company or TimkenSteel) was incorporated in Ohio on October 24, 2013, and became an independent, publicly traded company as the result of a spinoff (spinoff) from The Timken Company (Timken) on June 30, 2014. In the spinoff, Timken transferred to us all of the assets and generally all of the liabilities related to Timken’s steel business. 
TimkenSteel traces its roots back to The Timken Roller Bearing Company, which was founded in 1899 by carriage-maker/inventor Henry Timken and his two sons. By 1913, the company launched its first formal research facility, centered on improving the quality of the raw materials used to make its bearings. Early research demonstrated the superiority of bearing steel made in electric-arc furnaces (rather than existing Bessemer and open hearth processes), and that finding, coupled with a desire to ensure a dependable supply of premium steel in the years leading into World War I, led to the decision to competitively produce steel in-house. When The Timken Roller Bearing Company’s Canton, Ohio steel plant became operational in 1917, it included one of the largest electric arc-furnace facilities in the country. 
We manufacture alloy steel, as well as carbon and micro-alloy steel, with an annual melt capacity of approximately 2 million tons and shipment capacity of 1.5 million tons. Our portfolio includes special bar quality (SBQ) bars, seamless mechanical tubing (tubes) and value-add solutions, such as precision steel components. In addition, we supply machining and thermal treatment services, as well as manage raw material recycling programs, which are used as a feeder system for our melt operations. Our products and services are used in a diverse range of demanding applications in the following market sectors: oil and gas; oil country tubular goods; automotive; industrial equipment; mining; construction; rail; aerospace and defense; heavy truck; agriculture; and power generation. 
Based on our knowledge of the steel industry, we believe we are the only focused SBQ steel producer in North America and have the largest SBQ steel large bar (6-inch diameter and greater) production capacity among the North American steel producers. In addition, we are the only steel manufacturer able to produce rolled SBQ steel large bars up to 16-inches in diameter. SBQ steel is made to restrictive chemical compositions and high internal purity levels and is used in critical mechanical applications. We make these products from nearly 100% recycled steel, using our expertise in raw materials to create custom steel products with a competitive cost structure similar to that of a high-volume producer. We focus on creating tailored products and services for our customers’ most demanding applications. Our engineers are experts in both materials and applications, so we can work closely with each customer to deliver flexible solutions related to our products as well as to their applications and supply chains. We believe our unique operating model and production assets give us a competitive advantage in our industry. 
The SBQ bars and tubes production processes take place at our Canton, Ohio manufacturing location. This location accounts for all of the SBQ bars and seamless mechanical tubes we produce and includes three manufacturing facilities: the Faircrest, Harrison, and Gambrinus facilities. Our value-add solutions production processes take place at three downstream manufacturing facilities: TimkenSteel Material Services (Houston, TX), Tryon Peak (Columbus, NC), and St. Clair (Eaton, OH). Many of the production processes are integrated, and the manufacturing facilities produce products that are sold in all of our market sectors. As a result, investments in our facilities and resource allocation decisions affecting our operations are designed to benefit the overall business, not any specific aspect of the business.
Operating Segments 
Effective January 1, 2016, we eliminated our segment reporting as a result of organizational changes made in the second half of 2015, in addition to the integrated nature of our business as described above. These organizational changes were made to better align resources to support the business strategy of operating in a leaner, more efficient environment. Specifically, we centralized our customer-facing activities under one leadership role and eliminated the former two segment operating structure. Since that change, we are organized in a centralized manner based on functionality. As a result, we conduct our business activities and report financial results as one business segment. 
The presentation of financial results as one reportable segment is consistent with the way we operate our business under the realigned organization and is consistent with the manner in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates performance and makes resource and operating decisions for the business as described above. Furthermore, the Company notes that monitoring financial results as one reportable segment helps the CODM manage costs on a consolidated basis, consistent with the integrated nature of our operations.

Strengths and Strategy
We believe our business model is unique in our industry and focuses on creating tailored products and services for our customers’ most demanding applications and supply chains. Our team, including degreed engineers and experienced manufacturing professionals in both materials and applications, works closely with each customer to deliver flexible solutions related to our products as well as their applications and supply chains. We believe few others can consistently deliver that kind of customization and responsiveness.
The TimkenSteel business model delivers these tailored solutions based on the following foundation:

• | Deep and experienced management and technical team.


• | Close and trusted working relationship with customers across diverse end markets.


• | Leadership position in niche markets with differentiated products.


• | Track record of innovation rooted in a deep technical knowledge of steel materials, manufacturing processes and end-user applications. Our research and development efforts focus on creating the answers to our customers’ toughest engineering challenges and then leveraging those answers into new product offerings. On average, over a 5-year period, 30% of our sales are based on new business.

Recent capital investments are expected to significantly strengthen our leadership position while enhancing our operational performance and customer service.
Major Customers
We sell products and services that are used in a diverse range of demanding applications around the world. Our customers include companies in the following market sectors: oil and gas; oil country tubular goods; automotive; industrial equipment; mining; construction; rail; aerospace and defense; heavy truck; agriculture; and power generation. Our customer base is diverse. In 2016, we did not have direct sales to any single customer that accounted for 10% or more of our total sales.
Products
We believe we produce some of the cleanest, highest performing alloy air-melted steels in the world for our customers’ most demanding applications. Most of our steel is custom-engineered. We leverage our technical knowledge, development expertise and production and engineering capabilities across all of our products and end-markets to deliver high-performance products to our customers.
SBQ Steel and Seamless Mechanical Steel Tubing. Our focus is on alloy steel, although in total we manufacture more than 500 grades of high-performance carbon, micro-alloy and alloy steel, sold as ingots, bars and tubes. These products are custom-made in a variety of chemistries, lengths and finishes. Our metallurgical expertise and what we believe to be unique operational capabilities drive high-value solutions for industrial, energy and mobile customers. Our specialty steels are featured in a wide variety of end products including: oil country drill pipe; bits and collars; gears; hubs; axles; crankshafts and connecting rods; bearing races and rolling elements; bushings; fuel injectors; wind energy shafts; anti-friction bearings; and other demanding applications where mechanical power transmission is critical to the end customer.
Value-added Precision Products and Services. In addition to our customized steels, we also custom-make precision components that provide us with the opportunity to further expand our market for bar and tube products and capture additional sales by streamlining customer supply chains. These products provide customers, especially those in the automotive, energy and bearing industries, with ready-to-finish components that simplify vendor management, streamline supply chains and often cost less than other alternatives. We also customize products and services for the energy market sector. We offer well-boring and finishing products that, when combined with our wide range of high-quality alloy steel bars and tubes, can create a one-stop steel source for customers in the energy market sector. Our experts operate precision honing, pull-boring, skiving, outside diameter turning and milling equipment to deliver precision hole-finishing to meet exacting dimensional tolerances.
Sales and Distribution
3

Our sales force is largely made up of engineers that are backed by a team of metallurgists and other technical experts. While most of our products are sold directly to original equipment (OE) manufacturers, a portion of our sales are made through authorized distributors and steel service centers, representing approximately 15% of net sales during 2016. 
The majority of our customers are served through individually-negotiated price agreements that have a one-year term. A smaller percentage of our customers have pricing agreements that extend for more than one year and contain prices fixed for a period extending beyond current shipments. We do not believe that there is any significant loss of earnings risk with any given pricing term. 
Competition
The steel industry, both domestically and globally, is highly competitive and is expected to remain so. Maintaining high standards of product quality and reliability, while keeping production costs competitive, is essential to our ability to compete with domestic and foreign manufacturers of mechanical components and alloy steel. For bar products less than 6-inch in diameter, principal competitors include foreign-owned domestic producers Gerdau Special Steel North America (a unit of Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau, S.A) and Republic Steel (a unit of Mexican steel producer ICH). For bar products up to 9-inch in diameter, domestic producers Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation (in some cases up to 10-inch) are our principal competitors. For very large bars from 10 to 16 inches in diameter, offshore producers as well as specialty forging companies in North America such as Scot Forge and Sorel Steel are the primary competitors. For seamless mechanical tubing, offshore producers such as Tenaris, S.A., Vallourec, S.A. and TMK Group are our primary competitors as well as the foreign-owned domestic producer ArcelorMittal Tubular Products (a unit of Luxembourg based ArcelorMittal, S.A.). We also provide unique value-added steel products and supply chain solutions to our customers in the industrial, energy and automotive sectors. 
Backlog
The backlog of orders for our operations is estimated to have been approximately 200,000 tons at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Virtually our entire backlog at December 31, 2016 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding 12 months. Actual shipments depend upon customers’ ever-changing production schedules. During these periods of shorter lead times, backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future sales. Accordingly, we do not believe our backlog data and comparisons thereof, as of different dates, reliably indicate future sales or shipments.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials that we use to manufacture steel are recycled scrap metal, chrome, nickel, molybdenum oxide, vanadium and other alloy materials. Raw materials comprise a significant portion of the steelmaking cost structure and are subject to price and availability changes due to global demand fluctuations and local supply limitations. Proper selection and management of raw materials can have a significant impact on procurement cost, flexibility to supply changes, steelmaking energy costs and mill productivity. Because of our diverse order book and demanding steel requirements, we have developed differentiated expertise in this area and created a raw material management system that contributes to our competitive cost position and advantage.
In addition to accessing scrap and alloys through the open market, we have established a scrap return supply chain with many of our customers. We operate a scrap processing company for improved access, reliability and cost. Our raw material feeder system is designed to achieve high consistency, reliable chemistry and low variability from a number of our sources. We have extensive segregation points, chemistry monitoring, computerized modeling of variability and total systems optimization (inventory, operating practices, capacity impact, order book, procurement flexibility and strategy). Roughly 40% of our raw material sources are considered “highly controlled,” which gives us greater flexibility to substitute lower-cost scrap based on availability. Our raw material management process achieves procurement at competitive costs. This part of our business solidly rests on a deep knowledge of the raw material supply industry and an extensive network of relationships that result in steady, reliable supply from our raw material sources.
Research
Our engineers analyze customer application challenges and develop new solutions to address them. With a century of experience in materials science and steelmaking, we leverage our technical know-how to improve the performance of our customers’ products and supply chains.
We invest in technology that results in cleaner, stronger, and more easily processed materials. Our engineers drive technology advances in many market sectors, producing new and improved products that have demonstrated increased performance 
4

in high-stress conditions. Whether we need to develop new material specifications or help solve a customer processing challenge, our advanced material engineers are among the most knowledgeable in our industry.
This expertise extends to advanced process technology in which advanced material conversion, finishing, gaging and assembly enables high quality production of our products. With resources dedicated to studying, developing and implementing new manufacturing processes and technologies, we are able to support new product growth and create value for our customers.
Our research and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $8.0 million, $8.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively.
Environmental Matters 
We continue our efforts to protect the environment and comply with environmental protection laws. Additionally, we have invested in pollution control equipment and updated plant operational practices. We are committed to implementing a documented environmental management system worldwide which may include becoming certified under the ISO 14001 standard. As of December 31, 2016, all of our steel making and two of our value-add plants have obtained and maintained ISO 14001 certification.
We believe we have established appropriate reserves to cover our environmental expenses. We have a well-established environmental compliance audit program for our domestic units. This program measures performance against applicable laws as well as against internal standards that have been established for all units. It is difficult to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements that differ from existing ones. As previously reported, we are unsure of the future financial impact to us from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule changes related to the Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act, waste and other environmental rules and regulations. 
We and certain of our subsidiaries located in the U.S. have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Toxic Substance Control Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, CAA as well as other state laws. In general, such claims for investigation and remediation also have been asserted against other entities, which are believed to be financially solvent and are expected to substantially fulfill their proportionate share of any obligations. 
From time to time, we may be a party to lawsuits, claims or other proceedings related to environmental matters and/or receive notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the EPA and similar state or local authorities. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded reserves for such environmental matters of $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Accruals related to such environmental matters represent management’s best estimate of the fees and costs associated with these matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such matters, management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 
Legal Proceedings
We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of our management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We own a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, licenses, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as substantial know-how and technology relating to certain products and the processes for their production. While we regard these as important, we do not deem our business to be materially dependent upon any one item or group of items. 
Employment
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,500 employees, with about 58% of our employees covered under one of two collective bargaining agreements that expire in September 2017 and December 2019, respectively. The collective bargaining agreement that expires in September 2017 covers approximately 57% of our employees.
