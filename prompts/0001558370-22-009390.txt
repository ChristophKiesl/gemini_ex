Item 1. Business.
​
General
​
TESSCO Technologies Incorporated (which we sometimes refer to as “Tessco”, “we”, or the “Company”) is a value-added technology distributor, manufacturer, and solutions provider serving customers in the wireless infrastructure market. The Company was founded 40 years ago with a commitment to deliver industry-leading products, knowledge, solutions, and customer service. Tessco supplies over 47,000 products from more than 300 of the industry’s top manufacturers in mobile communications, Wi-Fi, Internet of Things, 5G, wireless backhaul, and more. Tessco is a single source for outstanding customer experience, expert knowledge, and complete end-to-end solutions for the wireless industry. 
​
On December 2, 2020, we sold most of our retail inventory and certain other retail-related assets to Voice Comm, LLC (“Voice Comm”). In connection with this sale, we assigned or licensed our Ventev®- related intellectual property, including the Ventev® trademark, to Voice Comm for their use in connection with the sale of mobile device and accessory products. Together, this resulted in the Company’s exit from its Retail business. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect the results of the Retail segment as a discontinued operation. See Note 20, “Discontinued Operations”, for further information. Additionally, the narrative discussion presented below in this Item 1 of this Annual Report is specific to the continuing operations of the Company (formerly, our Commercial segment), unless otherwise noted.
​
Our customers include a diversified mix of carrier and public network operators, tower owners, program managers, contractors, integrators, private system operators (including railroads, utilities, mining operators and oil and gas operators), federal, state and local governments, manufacturers, national solutions providers and value-added resellers. We currently serve an average of approximately 3,700 different customers per month.
​
We provide our customers with products and solutions to help them support these primary applications:
​

● | DAS (Distributed Antenna Systems) for In-Building Cellular and Public Safety Coverage

​
We source and develop our product offerings from leading manufacturers throughout the world, and also offer innovative, high quality products developed and manufactured under our proprietary brand, Ventev®, to our customers. In connection with the sale to Voice Comm of Retail business assets, we licensed or assigned to Voice Comm certain intellectual property rights, including our Ventev® brand as it relates to mobile device accessory products. We generally retain rights to the Ventev® brand as it relates to other than mobile device and accessory products.
​
Our operational platform removes complexity for customers and suppliers by streamlining the management of the supply chain and lowering total inventory and cost by providing the option of guaranteed availability and complete, on-time delivery to the point of use.

We began our “total source” operations in 1982, reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1987, and have been listed on Nasdaq (symbol: TESS), since 1994. We operate under ISO 9001:2015 and TL 9000:2016-V R6.3/5.7 registrations. 
​
For information regarding our website address and regarding material available free of charge through the website, see the information appearing under the heading “Available Information” included in Item 7 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 27, 2022. 
​
Customers
​
We operate as two segments: Carrier, which is comprised of customers that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; and Commercial, which includes value-added resellers, the government channel and private system operator markets. The Company previously operated as one segment in fiscal 2021 and identified a change to our reportable segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as a result of changes in organizational structure.
​
Sales to the Carrier segment accounted for approximately 43% of our fiscal year 2022 revenues, and sales to the Commercial segment accounted for 57% of fiscal year 2022 revenues. 
​
Our top ten customer relationships were responsible for 35% of our revenues for fiscal year 2022. No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. 
​
Approximately 98% of our sales have been made to customers in the United States during each of the past three fiscal years, although we currently sell to customers in over 50 countries. Due to our diverse product offerings and our wide customer base, our business is not significantly affected by seasonality in the aggregate. However, our sales could be affected by weather conditions or events in the United States, especially in our fourth fiscal quarter. Our fourth fiscal quarter is also at times impacted by delays in our customers’ calendar year budget approval processes. 
​
Products
​
We principally offer competitively priced, manufacturer branded products, ranging from simple hardware items to sophisticated test equipment, with per item prices ranging from less than $1 to over $50,000 and gross profit margins ranging from less than 5% to 99%. We offer products broadly classified into the following three categories: base station infrastructure; network systems; and installation, test and maintenance products.
​
Base station infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless broadband systems. These products include base station antennas, cable and transmission lines, small towers, lightning protection devices, connectors, power systems, enclosures, grounding, jumpers, miscellaneous hardware, and mobile antennas. Network systems products include fixed and mobile broadband radio equipment, wireless networking filtering systems, distributed antenna systems, two-way radios and security and surveillance products. Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment. Products include sophisticated analysis equipment and various frequency-, voltage- and power-measuring devices, as well as an assortment of tools, hardware, GPS, safety, replacement and component parts and supplies required by service technicians. Inventory typically has a life cycle that tends to be tied to changes in regulation or technology and includes products typically used by business entities or governments.
​
While we principally provide manufacturer branded products, a variety of products are developed, manufactured and offered under our own brand, VentevÒ. These products generally consist of network infrastructure products, such as radio enclosures, power products, cable and antennas. Sales of Ventev® products were 9% of our revenues in fiscal year 2022. 
​
Tessco’s Technical Services and Solutions Engineering teams are a key element of our offering as a value-added distributor. These teams include Solution Architects, Inbuilding, Power and Broadband Designers and Customer Technical Support (“CTS”) personnel. The broad product and supplier knowledge along with the multiple supplier certifications possessed by these teams have been recognized as a great benefit by our supplier partners and customers. Solution

Architects are specialists in their area of expertise providing consultation and system design. The CTS team are product level experts ensuring the correct devices are specified based on the application. This team can also recommend additional ancillary products (antennas, cables, power, enclosures, etc.) needed to provide a complete solution for the customer’s application. These services, other than design services, which comprise an immaterial portion of our revenues, are provided as part of a complete offering and are not billed in addition to the product.
​
These teams provide customer support on thousands of calls and support ticket-items per year. They have completed designs covering solutions for DAS, IoT, WiFi, Networking, Wireless Broadband, Power Systems and Testing applications. These solutions teams support both existing and emerging markets, including Macro/Small Cells, Public Safety, Utilities, Transportation, National Solutions Providers, Government, System Integrators and Fortune 500 companies. 
​
As part of our commitment to customer service, we typically allow most customers to return most products for any reason, for credit, within 30 days of the date of purchase. Total returns and credits have been less than 3% of revenues in each of the past three fiscal years. 
​
Revenues from sales of products purchased from our largest wireless infrastructure supplier accounted for 29% of fiscal year 2022 continuing operations revenues. No other individual supplier accounted for more than 10% of sales. Sales of products purchased from our ten largest wireless infrastructure suppliers generated approximately 54% of our total fiscal year 2022 revenues. 
​
The amount of purchases we make from each of our more than 300 suppliers may significantly increase or decrease over time.  As the level of business changes, we may request, or be requested by our suppliers, to adjust the terms of our relationships.  Therefore, our ability to purchase and re-sell products from each of our suppliers depends on our ability to reach and maintain agreements with these suppliers on acceptable business terms.  In addition, the agreements and arrangements on which most of our larger supplier relationships are based are typically of limited duration and terminable for any or no reason by either party upon notice of varying lengths, usually between several months or otherwise short notice. Generally, we believe that alternative sources of supply are available for many of the product types we carry, although we may be unable, or find it more difficult, to source branded products from other than the manufacturer. 
​
The scope of products available for purchase from a given supplier may fluctuate and is generally limited only by the scope of the supplier’s catalog and available inventory. Therefore, we may source the same product type from multiple suppliers, although in some instances branded products are available only from the manufacturer or a particular supplier, and in some instances, customers might favor one supplier or brand over another. The terms of the supplier contract typically apply to all products purchased from a particular supplier, whether or not the item is specifically identified in the contract. 
​
When negotiating with suppliers, we seek the most favorable terms available under the circumstances. Our preferred terms include among others, terms that provide for product warranty and return rights, as well as product liability and intellectual property indemnification rights, in each case consistent with our preferred business methods and objectives. We have not been able, nor do we expect in the future to be able, to negotiate the inclusion of all our preferred terms, or our preferred language for those terms, in every supplier contract. The degree of our success in this regard is largely a function of the parties’ relative bargaining positions. 
​
We are dedicated to superior performance, quality and consistency of service in an effort to maintain and expand supplier relationships but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in this regard in the future, or that competitive pressures or other events beyond our control will not have a negative impact on our ability to maintain these relationships or to continue to derive revenues from these relationships.

Method of Operation
​
We believe that we have developed a highly integrated, technologically advanced and efficient method of operation based on the following key tenets: 
​

● | Understanding and anticipating customers' needs and building solutions by cultivating lasting relationships;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing customers with sales, service and technical support, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Providing customers what they need, when and where they need it by delivering integrated product and supply chain solutions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Helping customers enhance their operations by providing real-time order tracking and performance measurement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Market Development and Sales: In order to meet the needs of a dynamic and diverse marketplace, our sales and marketing activities are focused on our customers across our two business segments: 1) Carriers, and 2) Commercial. This organization allows for the development of unique product and solution offerings to meet the needs of our diverse customer base.
​
We understand and anticipate our customers’ needs, which allows us to offer comprehensive solutions and establish long-lasting relationships. Our customer base includes more than 182,000 fully opted in contacts across the full breadth of the wireless industry, with over 190,000 additional active contacts in our database, representing potential new customers. We are able to identify each contact’s unique need for information and the way in which they wish to receive it. This can include targeted marketing materials, including email marketing, web marketing, advertisements, direct mailers, and trade show marketing, to drive purchases and new business development. For instance, our email publication, The Wireless Update, is sent to a targeted list of 131,000 contacts each week.
​
Our dedicated sales team provides customer service and maintains key information about every customer or potential customer utilizing our Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) and marketing automation tools ensuring a positive experience at every interaction and allowing us to identify promising leads and allocate resources to convert them to customers. We serve approximately 3,700 customers each month and our goal is to create an experience that nurtures loyalty among our customers and delivers mutually beneficial outcomes in every transaction.
​
Solutions Engineering and Product Management: We actively monitor advances in technologies and industry trends, through both market research and continual customer and manufacturer interaction to enhance our product offering as new wireless communications products and technologies are developed. To complement our broad product portfolio, we provide technical expertise and consultation to assist our customers in understanding technology and choosing the right products for their specific application. Our personnel, including those we refer to as Solution Architects, offer applications engineering to market-specific needs such as:
​

● | DAS, Cellular and Public Safety IoT
--+------------------------------------


● | Two-Way/Land Mobile Radio
--+--------------------------


● | Wireless Networks
--+------------------


● | PLTE
--+-----

● | Macro and Small Cells
--+----------------------


● | Power Systems
--+--------------


● | Test Solutions
--+---------------

​
In addition to determining the product offering, our Product and Solutions Engineering Teams provide the technical foundation for both customers and our personnel. Our product management software is continually updated to add new products and additional technical information in response to manufacturer specification changes and customer inquiries. This software provides detailed information on each SKU offered, including full product descriptions, category classifications, technical specifications, illustrations, product cost, pricing and delivery information, alternative and 

6



associated products, and purchase and sales histories. This information is available on a real-time basis to all of our personnel for product development, procurement, technical support, cataloging and marketing. 
​
Strategic Marketing – As a thought leader in the wireless industry, Tessco’s marketing materials educate the industry and promote our services and unique value proposition. Our weekly commercial digital newsletter, The Wireless Update, keeps 131,000 of our customers informed on the latest news in the industry, new products and solutions from our manufacturers, upcoming events and training opportunities, and more. In addition, strategic marketing supports the organization through the development of compelling original content, training programs, and other customer and manufacturer programs that solve business challenges and increase the value Tessco provides to the industry.

​
Tessco.com empowers our customers to make better decisions by delivering product knowledge so they are fully informed. This destination also enables our manufacturers to reach a broad and diverse customer base with their product offer and brand features. 
​
Customer Support and Order Entry: Our customer support teams are responsible for delivering sales and customer support services through an effective and efficient transaction system. We also continually monitor our customer service performance through customer surveys and process auditing. By combining our broad product offering with a commitment to superior customer service, we seek to reduce a customer's overall procurement costs by enabling the customer to consolidate the number of suppliers from which it obtains products, while also reducing the customer's need to maintain high inventory levels. 
​
Our information technology system provides detailed information on every customer account, including recent inquiries, buying and credit histories, separate buying locations within a customer account and contact history for key personnel, as well as detailed product information, including technical, product availability, and pricing information. The information technology system enables any customer support representative to provide any customer with personalized 

7



service and also allows non-technical personnel to provide a high level of technical product information and order assistance. 
​
We believe that our commitment to providing prompt, professional and efficient customer service before, during and after the sale enables us to maximize sales, customer satisfaction and customer retention. The monthly average number of customers decreased from approximately 3,800 for fiscal year 2021 to approximately 3,700 in fiscal year 2022. Due to the addition of several larger new relationships and an achievement of a greater share of many of our larger customers’ purchases, the average monthly purchase per customer increased from $5,500 in fiscal year 2021 to $9,400 in fiscal year 2022.
​
Procurement and Inventory Management: Our product management and purchasing system provides customers with a total source of broad and deep product availability, while attempting to maximize the return on our inventory investment. 
​
We use our information technology system to monitor and manage our inventory. Historical sales results, sales projections and information regarding supplier lead times are all used to determine appropriate inventory levels. Our information technology system also provides early warning reports regarding upcoming inventory requirements. As of March 27, 2022, and March 28, 2021, the Company had a backlog of approximately $75 million and $34 million, respectively. The significant increase in backlog is due to global supply chain issues that are adversely affecting the Company and the industry as a whole. For fiscal years ended March 27, 2022, and March 28, 2021, inventory write-offs and reserves were 1.1% and 1.0% of total purchases, respectively. Inventory turns for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were 6.2 and 5.9, respectively. 
​
Fulfillment and Distribution: Orders are received at our Timonium, Maryland and Reno, Nevada customer sales support centers. As orders are received, customer representatives have access to technical information, alternative and complementary product selections, product availability and pricing information, as well as customer purchasing and credit histories and recent inquiry summaries. An automated warehouse management system, which is integrated with the product planning and procurement system, allows us to ensure inventory control, to minimize multiple product shipments to complete an order and to limit inventory duplication. Bar-coded labels are used on every product, allowing distribution center personnel to utilize radio frequency scanners to locate products, fill orders and update inventory records in real-time, thus reducing overhead associated with the distribution functions. We contract with a variety of freight line and parcel transportation carrier partners to deliver orders to customers. 
​
Performance and Delivery Guarantee (“PDG”) charges are generally calculated on the basis of the weight of the products ordered and on the delivery service requested, rather than on distance to the customer. We believe that this approach emphasizes on-time delivery instead of shipment dates, enabling customers to minimize their inventories and reduce their overall procurement costs while guaranteeing date specific delivery, thereby encouraging them to make us their total source supplier. We have experienced an increase in third-party freight costs in fiscal year 2022 as a result of inflationary pressures and, as a result, we have increased PDG charges to customers to offset these increased costs.
​
Information Technology: Our information technology system is critical to the success of our operations. We have made and continue to make substantial investments in the development of these systems, which integrate cataloging, marketing, sales, fulfillment, inventory control and purchasing, financial control and internal and external communications. The information technology system includes highly developed customer and product databases and is integrated with our Configuration, Fulfillment and Delivery system. The information contained in these systems is available on a real-time basis to all of our employees as needed and is utilized in every area of our operations. Over the past three years we have been preparing to replace our legacy ERP system with a modern SAP ERP system. This new ERP system is expected to go live during fiscal year 2023.
​
We believe that we have been successful to date in pursuing a highly integrated, technologically advanced and efficient method of operations; however, disruption to our day-to-day operations, including failure of our information technology or distribution systems, or freight carrier interruption, could impair our ability to receive and process orders or to ship products in a timely and cost-efficient manner. 
​

Competition
​
The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented, and is comprised of distributors such as Accu-Tech, Alliance Corporation, Anixter, Graybar, KGPCo Logistics, Primus, ScanSource Inc., Synnex, Talley Communications, W.W. Grainger Inc., Wesco, and Winncom. In addition, many manufacturers sell and fulfill directly to customers. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high. In addition, the agreements or arrangements with our customers or suppliers looking to us for product and supply chain solutions are typically of limited duration and are often terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Accordingly, our ability to maintain these relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges. Some of our current competitors have substantially greater capital resources and sales and distribution capabilities than we do. In response to competitive pressures from any of our current or future competitors, we may be required to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase market share, and such measures could adversely affect our operating results. We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, our knowledge and expertise in wireless technologies and the wireless marketplace, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with more than 300 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the market. 
​
Continuing changes in the wireless communications industry, including risks associated with conflicting technology, changes in technology, inventory obsolescence, and consolidation among wireless carriers, could adversely affect future operating results. 
​
We believe that the principal competitive factors in supplying products to the wireless communications industry are the quality and consistency of customer service, particularly timely delivery of complete orders, breadth and quality of products offered and total procurement costs to the customer. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. In particular, we believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on the breadth of our product offerings, our ability to quickly provide products and supply chain solutions in response to customer demand and technological advances, our knowledge and expertise in wireless technologies, the level of our customer service and the reliability of our order fulfillment process. 
​
Intellectual Property
​
We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, service marks, confidentiality agreements, trade secret protection and, if and when appropriate, patent protection. Thus far, we have generally sought to protect our intellectual property, including our product data and information, customer information and information technology systems, through trademark filings and nondisclosure, confidentiality and trade secret agreements. We typically require our employees, consultants, and others having access to our intellectual property, to sign confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. There can be no assurance that these confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements will be honored, or whether they can be fully enforced, or that other entities may not independently develop systems, technologies or information similar to that on which we rely. 
​
TESSCO Communications Incorporated, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TESSCO Technologies Incorporated, maintains a number of registered trademarks and service marks in connection with our business activities, including: Tessco & You, Building Our Wireless World, Together®, TESSCO®, TESSCO Technologies®, Tessco.com®, Ventev®, and The Wireless Update®, among many others. Our general policy is to file for trademark and service mark protection for each of our trademarks and trade names and to enforce our rights against any infringement. 
​
We currently hold ten patents related to our Ventev® products. We intend, if and when appropriate, to seek patent protection for any additional patentable technology. The ability to obtain patent protection involves complex legal and factual questions. Others may obtain patent protection for technologies that are important to our business, and as a result, our business may be adversely affected. In response to patents of others, we may need to license the right to use technology patented by others or, in the event that a license cannot be obtained, to design our systems around the patents of others. 
​

Environmental Regulation
​
We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health matters in the United States. Compliance with these federal, state and local laws and regulations related to protection of the environment and employee safety and health has had no material effect on our business. There were no material expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal year 2022, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2023.
​
Human Capital
​
At Tessco, we aspire to build relationships and collaboration within all levels of the organization to create a culture that values and rewards all team members. Our culture encourages and rewards exceptional performance and continuous improvement, fosters teamwork, and supports career development and growth. We provide benefits that address the needs of our team members, compensation that is rewarding, a learning environment that is both exciting and challenging and we provide many different growth opportunities that benefit from the many skills of our diverse workforce. We have a professional working environment that fosters respect and celebrates our diverse perspectives.
​
As of March 27, 2022, we had 530 full-time equivalent employees, reduced from 589 as of March 28, 2021, in part as a result of our Retail business exit and a general decline in headcount. Of our full-time equivalent employees, 263 were engaged in customer and supplier service, marketing, sales and product management, 183 were engaged in fulfillment and distribution operations and 84 were engaged in administration and technology systems services. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Each year, we set corporate, department and individual goals against which we measure performance during our annual review process.
​
We offer a very competitive health benefit that is the same for all of our team members and is very affordable. We encourage our employees to participate in our health and wellness programs which include medical, dental and vision insurance. We offer a 401(k) program with an employer match, tax saving flexible spending accounts, Tessco paid life insurance and Employee Assistance Program.
​
We believe that the structure of our compensation program is aligned with the interests of our shareholders, rewards performance, and serves to attract and retain employees. 
​
We post all of our positions internally and follow a selection process that is open to all. Team Members that want to learn more about new opportunities are encouraged to have discussions with any of our Team Leaders as outlined in our open-door policy. We follow all processes and procedures of Affirmative Action and set yearly goals to ensure diversity in all of our Equal Employment Opportunity categories. 
​
We have a commitment to sustainable environmental practices and operations, diversity and inclusion, professional and leadership development, community involvement, and participation in and support of charitable causes. Our employee population is approximately 40% female and 33% minorities.  Additionally, women currently hold 40% and minorities hold 20% of our key leadership positions.  We continually strive to improve and created an Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Committee made up of individuals from around the organization to focus on our employee population as well as our environmental and social stewardship.  We strive to provide our employees with a variety of resources and tools to promote training and development. We consider our employee relations to be excellent.
