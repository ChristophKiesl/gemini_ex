ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview 
At Synchronoss, we build products that deliver trusted and engaging experiences for our customers and their subscribers at the moments that matter most. Our mission is to provide leading cloud, digital, messaging and network management platforms our customers use to connect, engage and monetize subscribers in more meaningful ways. Our technologies act as a catalyst to enable and unlock new capabilities in our customers’ organizations, creating value through new experiences for their end users and capitalizing on the rapidly converging services, connected devices, networks and applications.
Our businesses span primarily across four pillars and focus on driving profitable growth in business-to-consumer (“B2C”), business-to-business (“B2B”), enterprise and indirect channel (i.e., resellers/dealers) experiences. 
•White Label Personal Cloud: Cloud sync, backup, storage, device set up, content transfer and content engagement for user generated content. 
•Messaging:  White label consumer email solutions. Advanced, multi-channel messaging peer-to-peer (“P2P”) communications and application-to-person (“A2P”) commerce solutions. 
•Digital: Customer journey and workflow design, development, orchestration and experience management.
•Total Network Management (“TNM”): integrated application suite that designs, procures, manages and optimizes telecom network infrastructure. 
At Synchronoss, we are focused on delivering value to our customers and their end users through:
Managing Complexity:
Many companies struggle with legacy infrastructure and extensive software development lifecycles due to competing priorities. Within Synchronoss, we focus on managing and reducing the complexity, making it simple for our customers to deliver the trusted experiences their (end user) customers expect to have with them. Our platforms resolve complexity with back-end data and system frameworks to create simple, easy use cases to end users and subscribers. 
AI and Machine Learning:
Our platforms, products and solutions operate with the assistance of analytics, smart tagging, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, reporting and other data-driven insights. Our technology uses data to help shape user experiences, summarize reporting, prompt next best actions and recommendations and conduct automated dialogue with subscribers.
Trust & Dependability:
We are committed to providing high-quality, dependable services to our customers. To ensure reliability, system uptime and other service offerings, our transaction management is guaranteed through Service Level Agreements (“SLAs”). Our platforms offer a complete customer management solution, including exception handling, which we believe is one of the main factors that differentiates us from our competitors. 
Extensibility, Relevance & Scalability:
Our platforms and solutions are built in a modular fashion, thereby conducive to be extended dynamically and enabling our customers to offer solutions that are relevant to current market situations, with the goal of providing them with the competitive edge required for them to be successful. We support expanding transaction volumes reliably and cost effectively with platforms built to scale. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform is deployed across more than 95 million devices, managing 20 billion entities in the Cloud and performing more than 4 million synchronizations per day.
Security & Reliability
The marketplace is fraught with a constantly changing security threat landscape and increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Various governing bodies and companies are on heightened alert and aware of these increasing threats. Customers rely on us to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive company and client information including the systems and platforms they reside on. We also aims to safeguard the reputation of the company and its customers in the marketplace, maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulatory standards, and protect the privacy of user information.  All of our platforms have security oversight and are governed from an information security standpoint by the Synchronoss Information Security Program which is designed to achieve these goals and priorities.

Digital
The Synchronoss Digital Platform is a suite of technology, tools and solutions that includes digital experience creation and management, automated provisioning, artificial intelligence and financial analytics that service a broad swatch of TMT markets. 
By equipping our customers with a toolkit of capabilities, they can design, deploy and manage end user customer journeys and workflows easily and quickly from one central platform that also integrates across front end customer engagement channels as well as enterprise business systems (e.g. CRM, POS) allowing non-citizen developers to configure rather than code experiences. The platform sits between customer-facing touch points and a customer’s existing back-office systems to orchestrate data, workflows and processes into digital customer journeys that interface with end user channels creating user experiences that can be centrally managed and coordinated with less resources than is typical in a traditional IT environment.
•Digital Experience Platform (“DXP”) is a purpose-built, low-code experience creation and management toolset that sits between our customers’ end-user facing applications and their existing back end systems, enabling the authoring and management of customer journeys in a cloud-native no/low-code environment. 
•Our Digital Activation Module is powered by DXP and allows Operators and indirect mobility resellers to activate mobility plans with carriers without large, dedicated teams and affords flexibility at a fraction of the cost and time to go to market.
Demand Drivers for Our Business
In today’s business landscape, ‘Digital Transformation’ is not new or novel anymore; it is a necessary way of doing business in a landscape where access to technology has become democratized and the effects of citizen developers can change entire industries overnight. TMT providers need to digitally transform to increase and find new sources of revenue, reduce operational cost and complexity and improve the appeal of their products and services to better compete with new standards set by over-the-top (“OTT”) competitors.
Overall Trends in the TMT Market
•Convergence
•Digital Transformation
•Regulation
•Disintermediation
•5G
The biggest growth driver of the next five years is predicted to be the global adoption of 5G networks, and the epoch change in business that comes with it. In the U.S alone, telecom giant Ericsson predicts 320M 5G subscribers by 2025 with 86% of Deloitte-surveyed networking executives expecting advanced wireless solutions to transform their business within three years. 5G is being ushered in by network operators as a platform for innovation, not simply a next-generation improvement to network infrastructure. 5G is a hundred times faster than the current 4G technology, capable of supporting one hundred times more devices / km2 with a 50X improvement in total latency. While the extra speed and capacity that 5G provides is important, the improvements in network latency will usher in an entirely new spectrum of use cases that require instantaneous processing of large, multi-device data sets and faster, Artificial Intelligence decision-making at the edge. With 5G still in its infancy we believe there is significant opportunity to evolve our Personal Cloud and Advanced Messaging products to deliver a connected, personalized, 5G-enhanced experience for consumers. 
According to a recent study by Ericsson - with over 35,000 participants from 22 countries representing the opinions of over 1 billion smartphone users globally - 43% of smartphone users are willing to pay a significant premium for a 5G plan expect new applications and services as a part of the offering. And with that new, shiny plan 5G users are expected to consume, on average, 2-3X more data than their 4G counterparts with an expected 76% of that traffic being attributed to video by 2025. As more smart devices come online and more personal content is uploaded in 4K/8K Ultra-HD we believe the demand for consumer cloud services will expand exponentially. To meet that demand. over the next five years, we believe our white-label Personal Cloud product will transform into a personal content engagement platform that organizes and enhances a user’s digital life, creating meaningful connections between friends and family, and puts them back in control of their personal data.
With the worldwide edge computing market forecasted to reach ~$250B in 2024, emerging markets leapfrogging to 5G infrastructure, and over 50% of the world expected to have 5G coverage by 2025 we believe these factors will create a significant breeding ground for 5G-backed innovation and customer expansion. By leveraging our existing relationships with the world’s largest mobile and broadband network operators and driving increased consumption and engagement with our more than 7 million Personal Cloud user base, we believe we are uniquely positioned to be the leading global provider of white label, 5G consumer cloud engagement apps.
Competition
Competition across our markets is incredibly diverse, dynamic and nuanced in an increasingly interconnected landscape of rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, new product introductions and converging spaces and services.
We face the following categories of competitors:
•OTT Service & Platform Providers - Apple, Google, Dropbox, Box, Microsoft and Amazon all provide personal cloud services closely integrated to their respective technology or service platforms. 
•White Label Platform Providers - The field of platform-independent, white label personal cloud providers has consolidated in recent years with Funambol, One Drive and others competing for Operator distribution deals. However, these providers target second and third tier regional operators with low-risk, revenue share business models and do not generally pose a real threat to Tier 1 world-wide Operators. 
•The emerging RCS marketplace is intensely competitive across the globe. Leading OTT device and OS platform providers, led by Google, Samsung along with prominent online platform providers such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, WeChat, and LINE have created a radically new market for communication and monetization that is turning “messaging” into a new, virtual OS.
•System Integrators - Accenture, Amdocs and others engage our customers in long term contracts for services focused on digital transformation.
•CRM and BPM Providers - Major providers of CRM and other systems of record such as Salesforce, Pega Systems and Vlocity
•Telecom Expense Management (TEM) Providers – major providers of both wholesale and retail TEM software and services such as TEOCO and Tangoe.
•Telecom Service Order Management Providers – major providers of software that manage the full order lifecycle of telecommunications service orders such as Neustar. Order management applications and processes developed/utilized by Operators also present competition.
•Geospatial Network Planning Providers – major providers of software that manage the planning and design of physical communication networks such as Bentley, GE Smallworld, and 3-GIS.
To compete against global platform providers, we are compelled to maximize our natural advantages through the relationships we have with our customers and partners and the unique value we offer them: bottom line increase in revenue and margins. We believe we compete favorably across these factors and are unhindered by legacy constraints. However, some of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services, the ability to bundle a broader range of products and services, larger marketing budgets, established marketing relationships, access to larger user bases, major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers, and greater financial, technical, and other resources.
Human Capital
At Synchronoss, we believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to our diverse employee base and an experienced management team, with a mission to make Synchronoss a great place to work. We continue to invest in our employees, as well as developing and promoting our team-oriented culture, and believe that these efforts provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,598 full-time employees located in India, North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements. 
We have a purpose-driven culture, with a focus on employee input and well-being, which we believe enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We offer learning and development programs for all employees. Employees are able to actively voice their questions and thoughts through many internal channels, including our company townhall meetings and employee engagement surveys. While we have always had distributed teams collaborating around the globe, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an unexpected experiment in remote work, as the vast majority of our employees pivoted to working from home starting in March 2020. In May 2020, we announced that most employees will continue to have the option to work remotely even after we reopen our offices. This flexible location policy has unlocked opportunities to source, connect, and hire talent in more locations. We believe it will also enable us to retain talent, as employees can continue to work for Synchronoss if they need or want to relocate.
A key focus of our human capital management approach is our commitment to improving inclusion and diversity. In 2020, our focus was on building sustainable systems to champion inclusion and diversity via three critical channels — growing our 
Communities program (employee resource groups), equipping our managers to build and lead inclusive teams, and making diversity a central component of our recruiting strategy. 
From a total rewards perspective, Synchronoss offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, which we review and update each year. Our annual compensation planning coincides with our feedback cycle where employees and managers have performance conversations to facilitate learning and career development. As part of our compensation review program, we conduct pay equity analyses annually.
