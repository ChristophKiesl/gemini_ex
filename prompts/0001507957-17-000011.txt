ITEM 1:    BUSINESS
Our Company

Ideal Power Inc. was formed in Texas on May 17, 2007 and converted to a Delaware corporation on July 15, 2013. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms "Ideal Power," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Ideal Power Inc.

We design, market and sell electrical power conversion products using our proprietary technology called Power Packet Switching Architecture™, or PPSA™. PPSA™ is a power conversion technology that improves upon existing power conversion technologies in key product metrics, such as size and weight while providing built-in isolation and bi-directional and multi-port capabilities. PPSA™ utilizes standardized hardware with application specific embedded software. Our advanced technology is important to our business and we make significant investments in research and development and protection of our intellectual property. At December 31, 2016, we have been granted 32 US patents and six foreign patents related to PPSA™.

We sell our products primarily to systems integrators for inclusion in larger turn-key systems which enable end users to manage their electricity consumption by reducing demand charges or fossil fuel consumption, integrating renewable energy sources and forming their own microgrid. Our products are made by contract manufacturers to our specifications, enabling us to scale production to meet demand on a cost-effective basis without requiring significant expenditures on manufacturing facilities and equipment. As our products establish a foothold in key power conversion markets, we may begin to focus on licensing our proprietary PPSA™-based product designs to OEMs to reach more markets and customers. We may seek to build a portfolio of relationships that generate license fees and royalties from OEMs for sales of their products which integrate PPSA™.
Industry Background

Utility power grids are built using alternating current, or AC, generation, transmission, and distribution resources. This method of power transmission and distribution has been proven over time to be reliable and safe. The outlets in a typical home or business are AC but many electrical devices, such as computers, televisions, and other appliances operate on direct current, or DC, power. Batteries and photovoltaic, or PV, solar panels produce DC power as well. In order to connect DC devices to an AC power grid, a power conversion device is necessary.

We believe that significant changes in the supply of and demand for electrical power are driving demand for new energy infrastructure products and supporting technologies. In a traditional utility model, electrical power is generated from central stations and transmitted over long distance high-voltage transmission lines to substations where the voltage is reduced for distribution to consumers. Utility power grids are built to manage the flow of power in one direction, from generation to use, where sophisticated tools have been developed to match the amount of power being generated with the amount being consumed. Utilities ramp power plants up or down to closely match generation with load.

The rapid growth in worldwide renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar power, has added a new level of complexity to the task of matching power generation with consumption. These intermittent resources cannot be dispatched at will or relied upon to meet the peak power demands of the grid. Renewable energy sources tend to ramp up and down quickly. For example, a single cloud over a PV farm can cause electrical output to change dramatically in a matter of seconds. These new challenges make it increasingly difficult for utilities to accurately forecast and meet peak power demands.

Increased peak demand for power also has exposed weaknesses in the existing power grid. In high-cost, high-demand states, such as California, public utilities have instituted peak demand charges as a way to ration power during periods of peak demand and to incentivize customers to shift their power consumption to off-peak times. At the same time, both the Federal and certain state governments have created incentive programs to encourage the development and implementation of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which has the adverse consequence of making peak demand more difficult to forecast and satisfy. Strains on the electric grid have resulted in significant brown-outs and black-outs that have heightened awareness of the vulnerabilities of the existing system. As a result, power consumers are turning to new technologies to manage their energy consumption, lower costs and assure a reliable source of supply. We believe that distributed generation with advanced power conversion systems, such as our PPSA™ products, is becoming an increasingly important element of this new infrastructure.

In response to these changes in the market for electrical power, a number of technologies have been developed to enable users to more effectively manage their consumption and, one of these technologies, energy storage systems, has emerged as the best way to mitigate the instabilities and market inefficiencies caused by these emerging power grid realities. For example, a commercial business can shift energy usage from peak to non-peak times by installing a battery energy storage system, or BESS. The commercial business can use electricity generated during off-peak hours to charge the BESS and then use the stored power to satisfy all or part of its demand during peak hours. Similarly, a commercial business can install a solar power system to generate power for use either immediately upon generation or for storage in a BESS for later use.

Battery energy storage systems and many alternative energy sources provide power on a DC basis. However, the electric power grid and most electrical equipment operates on an AC basis. Consequently, power conversion systems are required to convert power from DC to AC or from AC or DC as necessary to make the various components of the system function together. In addition to converting power, power conversion systems enable customers to regulate current, voltage and frequency while optimizing system resources such as batteries, PV and the utility power grid to reduce energy costs. Systems incorporating advanced power converters may also manage distributed grid energy storage and be used to create stand-alone microgrids to bring power to a business or residence if the main electrical grid, if one is present, is unavailable.

Our Technology

PPSA™ uses indirect power flow in which power flows through input switches and is temporarily stored in our proprietary AC link inductor. Our proprietary fast switching algorithms enable the transfer of quantum packets of power between ports in our system. As the AC link becomes charged, it disconnects from its input switches, resonates without being connected to either the input or output switches, and then reconnects to its output switches when it reaches the correct voltage and frequency for the application.

Figure 1: Schematic of PPSA™ Process


Traditional power conversion systems use continuous power flow that relies on relatively heavy and expensive magnetic components and bulk capacitors. Many of these traditional systems have custom hardware for specific applications and are not readily adaptable or customizable. Because they are relatively inefficient, these systems generate excess heat that causes electrical and thermal stresses resulting in drive component failures and losses. By contrast, our conversion technology eliminates the majority of the passive components of traditional power conversion systems, including the separate isolation transformer and most of the inductors and bulk capacitors.

We believe PPSA™ offers several key advantages over traditional technologies, such as:

• | Bi-directional: PPSA™ is inherently bi-directional enabling power flow in both directions. For example, one PPSA™-based power converter could be used to both charge and discharge batteries. 

5


• | Built-in Isolation: PPSA™-based power converters have built-in isolation and thus do not require an isolation transformer which adds cost, size and weight and reduces the efficiency of battery energy storage systems. 


• | Multi-Port Capabilities: PPSA™ architecture enables multiple AC and/or DC sources and uses to be connected together in one power converter, minimizing total system cost for tying together, for example, DC solar PV and DC batteries to the AC grid. 


• | Scalability/Flexibility: PPSA™ is made from standard industry components, is battery agnostic and software driven, thus providing more scalability that enables rapid development cycles for new products and new applications. This same functionality provides ultimate flexibility for customers globally as it is capable of power conversion in both 50Hz and 60Hz AC environments. 


• | Size and Weight: PPSA™ reduces size and weight by eliminating passive components such as isolation transformers, inductors and bulk capacitors. Reduced sized and weight result in lower transportation and installation costs. Our newest, fully isolated 30kW power conversion system weighs less than 150 pounds. By contrast, similar transformer-based 30kW power conversion systems typically weigh over 600 pounds. 

Products 

We have developed products commercializing PPSA™ and make these products available for sale both directly to customers and through distributors. We currently sell several power conversion systems, or PCS, utilizing our patented PPSA™ technology. These products are described as follows:

• | The 30kW SunDial™ and the 30kW SunDial Plus™, which are UL-1741 certified and are intended to be used for the commercial and industrial grid-tied solar and solar plus storage market. The SunDial™ is a PV string inverter which is field upgradable through the addition of a drop-in second DC port to connect batteries to a solar PV array. The SunDial Plus™ includes the PV inverter and the second DC battery port in one package. These products both include a built-in 6 string PV combiner and DC disconnects and are grid-tied, AC export only. 


• | The 30kW Stabiliti™ series has two product offerings, two-port (AC-DC) and multi-port (AC-DC-DC) models, which are both UL-1741 certified. These products are intended to be used in the stand-alone storage and microgrid markets. They are bi-directional and operate in both grid-tied and grid-forming modes with near seamless transfer between operating modes. Grid-forming mode provides customers the ability to form and manage a microgrid. The products operate in both 50Hz and 60Hz environments and will be introduced in markets other than North America in 2017.


• | 125kW Grid-Resilient AC-DC PCS, which is certified for UL1741 conformance, has over four times the power of the 30kW product and is also able to convert in both 50Hz and 60Hz AC environments and form and manage a microgrid. This product is intended for use in higher power stand-alone storage and microgrid applications.

Future Innovations

Bi-Directional Switches

Our existing products incorporate multiple insulated gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”), which are power switches used in the process to convert power from one current form to another. IGBTs switch power in only one direction (DC to AC or AC to DC) and require the use of a blocking diode to prevent power from flowing back through the system. To enable our existing products to perform bi-directional power conversion, for each IGBT and diode used in our products, we must include a second IGBT and diode. These additional components have slight voltage drops that affect the electrical efficiency of our products and generate excess heat that must be dissipated. We have patented and are developing a new, highly efficient silicon switch called a bi-directional bipolar transistor, or B-TRAN™, that we believe will allow us to substitute one B-TRAN™ for two pairs of IGBTs and diodes used in our current products and is also a potential replacement for conventional power switches in the broader power semiconductor market.
Based on third party device software simulations, we believe that the B-TRANs™ can significantly improve electrical efficiency in our power converters. The higher efficiency would substantially reduce the heat generated by the operation of our products. As a result, products incorporating B-TRANs™ will require less space for heat dissipation which would allow us to increase power density, or power per pound, and reduce material costs.
6

In April 2016, we announced one of our semiconductor fabricators successfully tested B-TRAN™ silicon dies and the results were consistent with third party simulations that predict significant performance and efficiency improvements over conventional power switches such as SCRs, IGBTs and MOSFETs. In October 2016, we announced one of our semiconductor fabricators successfully completed the fabrication of prototype B-TRAN™ devices. The next major milestone towards commercializing the B-TRAN™ will be to begin testing a fully-packaged device in the first half of 2017.
We plan to first utilize the B-TRAN™ in our own power conversion products and then introduce it into the rapidly growing power semiconductor market, estimated to be $19 billion in 2017 according to research firm IHS Technology, or IHS, utilizing a licensing model. We believe our new B-TRAN™ technology can potentially address a significant portion of the power semiconductor market that currently relies on power semiconductor devices such as technologies such as IGBTs. Potential addressable markets for B-TRAN™-based products include very low loss solid-state DC and AC contactors, electric vehicle drivetrains, variable frequency drives, solar PV inverters, bi-directional energy storage and microgrid power conversion systems, matrix converters and other power conversion products. At December 31, 2016, we have 18 US and five foreign issued patents covering the operation, control and manufacturing of the B-TRAN™ device.
EV Fast Chargers
Electric vehicles, or EVs, are emerging as a fast growth area of the overall automotive sector in the US and abroad. As EVs become a more significant section of the automotive market, the infrastructure to support them will need to be developed. Our PPSA™ technology is a natural power conversion choice for system integrators looking for a highly efficient and compact system for an DC EV fast charger. In 2017, we expect to begin the development of products based on our existing product family to directly target this fast-growing market segment.
Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to promote and expand the uses of PPSA™ initially through product development and product sales. To bring our products to market, we will seek out best-in-class partners who will distribute, white-label or integrate our innovative products into higher value systems resulting in multiple strategic sales channels for our PPSA™-based products and product designs. Although our primary market is the United States, we will increasingly target markets outside the United States. As our products gain broader acceptance in the power conversion market, we intend to license our proprietary PPSA™-based product designs to OEMs within our target markets, as well as license our technologies for other markets which we do not plan to enter directly. The basis for this approach is the belief that OEMs may achieve higher product margins and gain more market share by providing PPSA™-based products, which are differentiated from the traditional product offerings in the industry, to their customers. We believe such strategic relationships with key OEM licensees would enable us to reap the benefits of PPSA™ and gain market share more quickly than by strictly manufacturing and distributing our products.
Target Markets

Currently, our primary markets are stand-alone storage, which represented a majority of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2016, and PV + storage. 
Stand-Alone Storage Market
Based on market studies and forecasts by IHS, as shown in Figure 2, the global stand-alone storage market is forecasted to grow to $13 billion cumulatively from 2017 through 2020. Based on our estimate that power conversion systems represent approximately 10% to 15% of the system cost, power conversion systems, such as ours, would account for approximately $2 billion of this market.

Figure 2: Stand-Alone Storage Market Forecast

The stand-alone storage market is served by BESS. BESS are racks of batteries coupled with a system controller and a power conversion system, such as those manufactured by us, to enable electric power to be captured, stored, and used in conjunction with electric power grids. These systems can be large, megawatt-scale systems operated by utilities to better manage their system resources, or smaller kilowatt-scale systems used by businesses and designed to enable these businesses to manage their power use and mitigate utility imposed "peak demand charges", which are charges utilities levy on their business customers for delivery of power at peak usage times of the day, such as mid-afternoons in the summer. The growth of peak demand charges has been substantial over the past decade and now can make up 50% or more of a commercial utility bill in certain markets. This is a trend that is likely to continue as more intermittent resources are added to the utility power grid causing grid instability. Utilities and aggregators of distributed generation resources are also expected to adopt BESS due to the proliferation of renewables and to take advantage of additional value streams such as energy arbitrage, frequency regulation and ancillary services, infrastructure upgrade deferral and locational capacity.

There are strong economic incentives available to commercial and industrial consumers in major US markets such as California and New York in the form of reduced demand charges for installing a BESS and reducing peak consumption. There is also strong regulatory support for such systems. For example, California has issued a mandate for over 1,000 megawatts of new energy storage to be installed by 2020. Our 30kW and 125kW power conversion systems enable these BESS to connect to the utility power grid and, when paired with batteries, offer these customers a substantial cost saving opportunity on their monthly electric bill. This market is still in its early years, but we have established a strong brand and position in this market with our customers having many systems installed and operating today. We believe this market offers a compelling value proposition today for our products.

We believe, as early as the second half of 2017, this market will begin to grow beyond pilot installations to higher volume installations driven by the underlying economics of BESS to commercial and industrial customers. A good indicator of this is the availability of third party financing for BESS. Several of our customers have signed, announced or are in negotiation for financing deals for their BESS products.

We expect the cost of commercial and industrial BESS to continue to decline due primarily to lower battery costs and, as a result, expect significant expansion in the addressable market for these systems. We also believe the combination of lower BESS costs, third-party financing, increases in utility demand charges, and the continued entrance of large, established companies to the BESS space will all contribute to accelerating market growth for stand-alone storage.

PV + Storage Market

The global solar PV + storage market is forecast by IHS to grow to over 4,000 mega-watts of PV, or MWPV, annually by 2020. Utilizing our estimate of $0.18 per watt, this translates to approximately $2 billion Solar PV + Storage power conversion market over the next four years. See Figure 3 below.
Figure 3: PV + Storage Market Forecast
PV has one of the lowest levelized costs of energy for new electrical generation capacity and this is expected to remain true in the near term. We expect distributed PV to continue to be a high growth business as system costs have fallen dramatically over the past several years. As such, the economics of generating PV for local consumption is expected to remain strong for several more years, especially given the investment tax credit, or ITC, extension passed by Congress and signed into law in 2015 for solar energy production. Our new Sundial™ products were launched in 2016 to directly address this market.
One shortcoming of distributed, behind-the-meter PV systems is that they require connection to the utility power grid in order to operate. For example, a business with PV on its roof will not, in most cases, benefit from the ability to generate power should the utility power grid go down. Another shortcoming of distributed PV systems is the instability they cause on the local power lines. Utility power grids were not designed to manage power inflow from the end of the lines. As such, distributed generation sources can lead to wide swings in line voltages when clouds pass and power output falls off, requiring the utility to ramp up its central power stations to make up for the shortfall in solar. We believe the proliferation of PV, its intermittency and the elimination of net metering in many states will drive significant growth in the PV + storage market.
Our power conversion products help resolve these shortcomings. For example, when a distributed PV system is connected to a BESS that includes one of our Stabiliti™ multi-port PCS, the business will benefit from the ability to form and manage a local microgrid powered by the PV system and BESS even when the utility power grid is down. This capability is attractive to electricity consumers who need to power critical loads even in a blackout. Our Stabiliti™ PCS are also equipped to meet evolving utility requirements for low voltage ride-through and other key operating parameters, enabling the PV and BESS it connects to the grid to help stabilize the utility power grid when voltage or frequency fluctuates due to imbalances in load and supply.

Commercial and industrial BESS are able to generate value far beyond peak demand reduction. We believe our products will become increasingly attractive to co-locate BESS with distributed PV. IHS, which has strong renewable industry focus, 
9

forecasts that global installations of grid-tied commercial BESS coupled with PV will grow to over 1,500 MW of commercial PV + storage systems being installed annually by 2020.

According to their research, IHS believes that systems will be deployed in two principal configurations. The present configuration is to have separate BESS and PV systems tied together through the AC wiring, which is supported by all of our current products. A second, emerging configuration will be to place the BESS and the PV system behind a single PCS with two DC inputs. This configuration is forecast to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and allow PV harvesting when operating without a utility power grid present in microgrid mode. Our Sundial Plus™ was designed specifically to enable this lower cost and more efficient second configuration.

Also according to IHS, the global commercial PV industry is projected to grow to over 33GW annually by 2020. IHS further forecasts that these commercial systems will have a 2% storage attachment rate by 2020, providing for a nearly 700MW annual commercial PV + storage market. These new PV + storage markets include providing backup power during blackouts, improving grid stability in high penetration PV areas and reducing fossil fuel consumption in remote and off-grid microgrids. 

Other Markets

Although our technology may be suitable for other vertical markets within the global power conversion market landscape, we do not currently offer products for sale directly to other power conversion markets such as the VFD, uninterruptible power supply, rail, wind or EV traction drive markets. 

In addition to the markets discussed above, we also have opportunities for market expansion into fast electric vehicle chargers in certain applications where our products’ compact size and multi-port capabilities can unlock value for the system integrator particularly in locations where battery storage is coupled with the charging system to eliminate demand charges or expand the charging systems response capabilities. We have provided PCS to multiple EV charging system integrators who have deployed initial projects using our products coupled with batteries at EV charging stations to prove out these concepts. As these initial installations begin to operate, the value propositions of these new opportunities will become clearer.

We plan to continue to monitor all power conversion markets for opportunities to create solutions for customers and unlock the broader value of our patented technology.
Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patents, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions with our employees and others, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, the software that is shipped with our products is encrypted. As of December 31, 2016, we have 50 US and 11 foreign issued patents. We also had approximately 100 additional pending U.S. and international patent applications. We expect to continue to build our patent estate for both our core power conversion technology, our bi-directional switch technology and other technological developments that broaden the scope of our technology platform.
Customers

Although we are expanding our customer base and channels to market, we have historically been reliant on a small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Sonnen Inc. and Gexpro accounted for 44% of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Sharp Corporation, Gexpro, Green Charge Networks, LLC, and Coda Energy LLC, accounted for 66% of net revenues. 
Sales and Marketing

We sell our products primarily to systems integrators for installation as part of a larger turn-key system providing end users with a complete solution for managing their energy consumption. Our products are also sold through distribution channel partners. Before a system integrator agrees to specify our products in their systems, the integrator engages in a lengthy and time-consuming process of testing and evaluating our equipment for use, which typically takes from a few months to as long as a year.

For certain geographic markets and applications, we may seek to enter into licensing agreements that would enable licensees to build our products for sale in local markets or we may license product designs to global brands for specific applications. In 2016, we entered into our first licensing agreement for our Sundial™ with Flex Ltd. (Nasdaq: Flex). 
10

NEXTracker Inc., a Flex company, will sell the Sundial™ as part of its newly launched NX Fusion Plus solar plus storage tracker.

Manufacturing and Supply

We use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products to our specifications. We have an agreement with one of our contract manufacturers pursuant to which we provide it with a rolling forecast of our expected demand. Finished products are produced based on upon our forecast, and we have the ability to delay shipments for up to 18 months from the date of the purchase order. The initial three-year term of the agreement expires in October 2017 and renews annually thereafter unless terminated. We intend to finalize an agreement with a second contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2017. We believe there are many contract manufacturers that are qualified to manufacture our products to our specifications.

Typically, our contract manufacturers are responsible for the sourcing of components and materials. We qualify sources for our components and materials. Our strategy is to have multiple suppliers for all of our components and materials. Currently, we have multiple sources for most of our components. A very limited number of components are single-sourced and the process of identifying and qualifying alternative sources for these components is underway.

Backlog

Our backlog was approximately $5.5 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $5.2 million at December 31, 2015. The Company defines backlog as consisting of accepted orders from customers for which a product delivery schedule has been specified. The purchased orders comprising backlog are not cancelable in most cases and such orders do not typically provide price protection. Nevertheless, deliveries against received purchase orders may be rescheduled within negotiated parameters and our backlog may therefore not be indicative of the level of future sales.
Competition

We will compete against well-established incumbent power conversion technology providers as these competitors enter the commercial and industrial markets. For our target markets, we believe that PPSA™ may provide significant competitive advantages compared to the traditional power conversion solutions sold by well-established power conversion technology providers.

Traditional Power Conversion:  Traditional power conversion systems are the conservative choice, as they are proven and have been commercially available longer than any other type of power conversion system. They provide isolation, but are big, heavy, and relatively inefficient. There have been improvements in the efficiency of transformer-based power conversion systems over the years, but we believe further improvements are limited due to the physical characteristics of transformers themselves. Major suppliers in this market include ABB, Eaton and Schneider Electric.

Transformerless PV Inverters: Transformerless PV solar inverters are a special class of power conversion system applicable only to PV arrays. They have become a popular choice in the market for PV applications, as they are lighter and more efficient than transformer based inverters. These transformerless inverters are one-way (DC to AC) inverters, and provide no electrical isolation. PV systems are not required to be electrically isolated in most electrical code jurisdictions. These PV inverters have no applicability to markets that require electrical isolation. Key providers of transformerless PV inverters include companies such as SMA and SolarEdge.
Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are presented as a line item under operating expenses and are expensed as incurred. Total research and development costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $5,224,992 and $5,521,390, respectively.
Employees

As of February 28, 2017, we have 30 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.

11

Industry Certifications

Industry certifications are generally required for our products. The main certification requirement is conformance to UL1741, which specifies standards for grid and product safety for grid-connected generation equipment, including the power conversion systems made by us. A National Recognized Testing Laboratory, or NRTL, must certify our products for conformance to UL1741 before our customers may install and use our products in grid-tied applications in the United States. We utilize both Underwriters Laboratories, or UL, and Intertek, or ETL, for our certification requirements. 

The European Union, or EU, Japan and other major jurisdictions have different certification test procedures, but generally test for similar safety and performance capabilities. Local certifications are likely to be required to sell our products outside of the United States for many applications. To date, we have not received any international certifications on our products but have deployed products in a few instances in foreign countries as demonstrations, test projects in laboratories or microgrid applications which may be exempt from the certification requirements. We expect to start the certification process in one or more international markets in 2017.

Government Regulation

Government approval is not required for us to sell our products. However, government support for renewable energy, grid storage, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improved grid resiliency, including incentives and mandates, may impact the size and growth rate of our target markets. Utility regulations and support may also impact these end markets. In the near term, government and utility support for many of these markets is generally required for these markets to grow and therefore changes in policy by governments or utilities may limit the near-term market opportunities for our products.
