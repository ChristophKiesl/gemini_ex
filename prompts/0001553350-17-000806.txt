ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Corporate History and Restructuring
 
We are a holding corporation that owns one hundred percent (100%) of a diagnostic medical device company specializing in discovering, developing and commercializing specialty medical devices.  We were organized on December 24, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada.   We own one hundred percent (100%) of Region Green Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation formed on December 12, 2013.  Region Green Limited owns one hundred percent (100%) of the stock in Dermal Diagnostic (Holdings) Limited, an England and Wales corporation formed on December 11, 2013.  Dermal Diagnostics (Holdings) Limited owns one hundred percent (100%) of the stock in Dermal Diagnostics Limited, an England and Wales corporation formed on January 20, 2009, and one hundred percent (100%) of the stock in Trial Clinic Limited, an England and Wales corporation formed on January 12, 2011.
 
In December 2013, we restructured the Company and re-domiciled as a domestic corporation in the United States.  The corporate re-organization was accomplished to preserve the tax advantages under the laws of the England and Wales tax laws for the benefit of the shareholders of both Dermal Diagnostics Limited ("DDL") and Trial Clinic Limited ("TCL").
 
 DDL is a diagnostic medical device company headquartered in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England. DDL was founded on January 20, 2009 to engage in the discovery, development and commercialization of diagnostic medical devices. The Company's initial focus has been on the development of a novel continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device.
 
Our Products
 
The Company's initial focus has been on the development of a novel continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device which consists of a disposable patch containing a sensor, and a non-disposable miniature electronic transmitter device with a disposable or re-chargeable power source. CGM through a non-invasive patch can enable detection of changes in blood glucose levels. In 2015, we named our technology 'sugarBEAT.' We currently have two (2) CGM sugarBEAT devices, the first a watch product, where the transmitter is inside the watch, and the watch is directly connected to the sensor using a wire, and the second being a body worn transmitter device into which the sensor is directly attached and transmits data directly to a smart phone App. The sugarBEAT device is referred to here as the packaging for the electronics that control and receive feedback from the "sensor-patch," which is based on our core platform technology.
 
The sugarBEAT works by extracting glucose from the skin into a chamber in the patch which is in direct contact with an electrode based sensor. On the watch device, the glucose sensor detects the level of glucose and stores the data on an internal memory platform, as well as displays the glucose reading on an LCD display. An alarm is set-off when the reading is 'out of range'. On the body worn transmitter device the raw data is sent to a Mobile Phone App where it is processed by an algorithm and displayed as a glucose reading, with the ability to track and trend the data over days, weeks and months. One of the techniques utilized in this device, reverse Ionotophoresis, has been the subject of extensive studies with over twenty (20) clinical reports in the public domain, and was approved by both the FDA and EMEA (European Medicines Evaluation Agency). The effectiveness of the CGM device in blood sugar control facilitates therapeutic adjustments to avoid hypo-glycemic and hyper-glycemic excursions and better glycemic control through lifestyle management.
 
Additional applications for the sugarBEAT device may include:
 
· Development of a Web-server accessed by physicians and diabetic professionals to track the condition remotely thereby reducing healthcare costs and managing the condition more effectively;
 
· A complete virtual doctor that monitors a person's vital signs and transmits results via the web; and
 
· With further investment, other patches can be developed which are able to measure alternative analytes, including lactate, uric acid, lithium and drugs. This would be a step-change in the monitoring of conditions, particularly in the hospital setting. Lactate monitoring is currently used to determine the relative fitness of professional athletes.

Our Business Strategy
 
We intend to lead in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative and targeted diagnostic medical devices that improve disease monitoring, management and overall patient care. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts establishing a new business and while operations have commenced we have generated revenue limited to license fees, from our limited operations. We plan to take the following steps to implement our broad business strategy. Our key commercial strategies post-approval will first be implemented in Europe and then in parts of the Middle East and Asia, and then the USA, as follows:
 
·  Develop our own specialty sales and marketing teams to market the sugarBEAT device in the European Union in partnership with our Joint Venture partner. We have a marketing rights agreement for the UK and Republic of Ireland (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) with Dallas Burston Pharma (Jersey) Ltd. We have also signed an agreement with Dallas Burston Pharma (Jersey) Limited to collaborate on the sale of the device to other European territories as part of an equal joint venture agreement. The full commercial agreement outlining the details of the joint venture agreement is expected to be finalised by the end of August 2017.  
 
We are in detailed discussions and negotiations with several other parties worldwide for licensing or entering in to joint venture agreements for the sale of the sugarBEAT.
 
·  Expand the indications for which the sugarBEAT device may be used. We believe that the sugarBEAT device may offer significant benefits other than those found in the non-acute setting for the monitoring of other diseases. This includes monitoring of lactic acid for performance athletics, and the monitoring of drugs. We intend to complete initial proof of concept in laboratory settings followed by a clinical program.
 
·  Expand our product pipeline through our proprietary platform technologies, acquisitions and strategic licensing arrangements. We intend to leverage our proprietary platform technologies to grow our portfolio of product candidates for the diagnosis of diabetes and other diseases. In addition, we intend to license our product and acquire products and technologies that are consistent with our research and development and business focus and strategies. This may include drug delivery products for the improved management of diabetes, for example improved insulin injector systems, and/or combination drug products for diabetes related drugs.


Product Development
 
Management has extensive experience in regulatory and clinical development of diagnostic medical devices. We intend to take advantage of this experience in the field of diagnostic medical devices in an attempt to increase the probability of product approval. The overall regulatory process for diagnostic medical devices for diabetes is currently similar to those governing other diagnostic devices. The timelines are shorter than where for example new drugs or completely invasive diagnostic devices are trialled in clinics. The non-invasive nature of sugarBEAT means the device can be tested and evaluated for its clinical output, in this case the accuracy with which it can trend blood glucose levels, which is in the order of several hours and days to see the end point, as compared to several months and years for an invasive device. In addition, because the results are instantaneous, and the device is worn for 24 hours at any given time, the clinical trials do not initially require long term follow-up for primary endpoints which ordinarily would otherwise take significant periods of time to evaluate. Accordingly, we believe our clinical trials may enrol quickly and that the evaluable data will be made available to us quickly. We believe our experience in the clinical development of diabetes diagnostic medical devices, our familiarity with the regulatory approval process in the United Kingdom and the European Union and shorter development times may allow for our first product to emerge onto the commercial markets by the end of 2017. As we continue to raise funds for marketing the device in some European Union territories, we will also collaborate with future licensees and marketing partners to achieve our product development and meet our projected milestones.

Market Opportunity for the Company's Products
 
According to the International Diabetes Federation Atlas (the "IDF"), there are approximately 382 million people in the world who had diabetes as of December 2013. The IDF is predicting that by 2035 this will rise to 592 million people. The number of people with type 2 diabetes is increasing in every country and currently eighty percent (80%) of people with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries. The greatest number of people with diabetes is between 40 and 59 years of age.
 
Statistics published by the IDF report that diabetes is a huge and growing problem, and the costs to society are high and escalating. In addition, Europe has the highest prevalence of children with type 1 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. The far more common type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin or doesn't make enough insulin.
 
Various factors may contribute to type 1 diabetes including genetics and exposure to certain viruses. Although type 1 diabetes typically appears during childhood or adolescence, it also can develop in adults.
 
Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure, although it can be managed. With proper treatment, people who have type 1 diabetes can expect to live longer, healthier lives than they did in the past. Type 1diabetes includes autoimmune type 1 diabetes (type 1a) which is characterized by having positive autoantibodies, as well as idiopathic type 1 diabetes (type 1b) where autoantibodies are negative and c-peptide is low. Patients with type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) require long term treatment with exogenous insulin and these patients perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to calculate the appropriate dose of insulin. SMBG is done by using blood samples obtained by finger sticks but frequent SMBG does not detect all the significant deviations in blood glucose, specifically in patients who have rapidly fluctuating glucose levels.
 
Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or noninsulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), your body's main source of fuel. With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells, or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. Untreated, type 2 diabetes can be life-threatening.
 
More common in adults, type 2 diabetes increasingly affects children as childhood obesity increases. There's no cure for type 2 diabetes, but it can be managed by eating well, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight. If diet and exercise don't control the blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may be required.
 
Each year, millions of patients undergo diabetes testing in the European Union and in the United States. The main reason for this testing is to detect and evaluate diabetes in patients with symptoms of diabetes. These studies provide clinical benefit in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected but unproven diabetes, and in those patients in whom a diagnosis of diabetes has been established and information on prognosis or risk is required.

We believe that our market opportunity is a direct function of the number of persons tested, diagnosed and treated for either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The IDF indicates that the total world market opportunity for a continuous glucose monitoring device is in the billions of dollars and is projected to grow annually through the year 2035.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We do not believe it is possible to estimate the number of diabetes patients that undergo finger pricks or other types of invasive glucose monitoring. However, we are unaware of any product currently on the market that may allow for non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring. We believe the sugarBEAT device may be readily adopted by the medical community for the assessment of a patient continuously.
 
We believe our non-invasive sugarBEAT device possesses many significant advantages and may represent an ideal device for the detection of discordances in an individual's blood sugar levels. If approved for commercialization, we believe the sugarBEAT device may represent a best in class non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring device to reach those afflicted with diabetes. While we cannot estimate the market share that our sugarBEAT device may capture, we believe that the sugarBEAT device will capture a significant share of the non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring market, in-particular the market that has been established by the Abbot Freestyle Libre device for glucose trending.
 
Commercialization Plan
 
We intend to develop our products through the completion of European CE mark and FDA PMA approvals, to verify the claims that the device may be used as an adjunct to a finger-stick measurement, and/or a glucose trending device such as those claims made by the Abbott Freestyle Libre device. We will seek to partner with organizations that may facilitate the further development and distribution of our products at all stages of development. We also intend to seek strategic partners early in the research and development cycle for programs that may fall outside of our core competencies.
Competition
 
We expect to compete with several medical device manufacturing companies including Dexcom, Abbott, Echo and Medtronic.   Our competitors may:
 
·  develop and market products that are less expensive or more effective than our future product;
 ·  commercialize competing products before we or our partners can launch any products developed by us;
 ·  operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;
 ·  initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;
 ·  have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;
 ·  more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and
 ·  take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.
 
We will compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their partners, may develop new products that will compete with ours, and these competitors may, and in certain cases do, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do.

We anticipate that we will have competition from specific companies. Although it is difficult to analyze our major competitors since currently there are no non-invasive diagnostic medical devices to continuously monitor blood glucose levels, we anticipate that specific companies may compete with us in the future. Echo Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ECTE) has developed the Symphony CGM System for use in the hospital critical care environment. This device is for continuous glucose blood level monitoring in a critical care environment in hospitals. This device does require the removal of the top layer of skin. As a result, we do not believe this device is a direct competitor of our product and there have been no indications that it will receive product approval in Europe or US in the near term.

 * The (Clarke) Error Grid is a method for quantifying the clinical accuracy of the blood glucose reading by taking the patients' blood glucose reading measured using a standard finger prick test and comparing it with the reading provided by a glucose meter or other device; The closer the reading of the device with the finger-prick blood glucose value, the higher the accuracy of the device. The % accuracy quoted here is the % of the readings in the Clark Error Grid that are in zones A & B (i.e., in the clinically significant zone).
 
Regulatory Requirements
 
Our device has been electrically safety tested, and all biocompatibility conformance also demonstrated, against the relevant European Medical Device Directives. When new materials are introduced, these undergo a biocompatibility risk assessment, and further testing where necessary. Batches of the device and patches were manufactured for human clinical studies that took place between November 2014 and December 2015. This was a functional watch device with a wore connection to a skin adhered sensor and electrode. Subsequent to studies conducted in India the device received a CE mark approval for glucose trending in February 2016. The device has since been upgraded to include wireless communication from a body worn/adhered transmitter and also to reduce the device size, and with an enhanced sensor system. Further clinical studies are ongoing to confirm the accuracy of the device and absence of skin irritation after which a further CE submission will be made to include new claims on the basis of which the body worn device will be launched in those territories that accept the CE mark approval. The watch device has been further miniaturised and in light of its somewhat obtrusive nature, it has been reserved for future clinical studies in critical care settings.
 
Prior to launching commercial sales of our product, we must complete key material points:
 
 
· | Completion of the technical dossier, documenting the entire design process including the industrial design, electronic design and software design for the final commercial product, incorporating the final aesthetics and materials for product launch.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Completion of human clinical studies in Type I and Type II diabetic patients against a defined clinical protocol, the outcome of which must support the claims for the device; additional ethics committee approvals and regulatory body approvals will be required if the device is to be tested in clinics other than those where ethics approval has already been obtained, or if clinical studies are planned in other countries, respectively.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Prepare the body worn transmitter, and sensor-electrode system for manufacturing for commercial sales, i.e., in large volumes. The patches (containing the sensors) and the device have been manufactured in small batches sufficient for clinical studies and laboratory testing. The scale up of the processes will be undertaken to mass-produce the sensors and patches and the devices in a scale that allows large volume batches to be produced cost effectively. This is necessary to ensure that the manufacturing costs of our products are minimized in order to effectively meet market demands.

Intellectual Property
 Nemaura has retained Serjeants LLP in Leicester, UK as patent counsel with respect to all matters relating to our technologies.  The Company believes that clear and extensive patent coverage for its technologies is central to long-term success and will invest accordingly.  This applies to both domestic and international patent coverage.
 
A Patent and Know How License was entered into between The University of Bath (“Bath”) and Nemaura Pharma Limited, a related company (“Pharma”) on June 21, 2012 (the “License Agreement”).  Under the terms of the License Agreement, Bath has granted to Pharma an exclusive license throughout the world to conduct research and make, use, sell, import and otherwise deal in products consisting of the self-calibrating iontophoresis-based technology for the transdermal measurement of certain physiological analytes, such as glucose, lactate and urea, in humans as described in patents owned by Bath and know-how provided by Bath.  Pharma If implemented successfully this technology would alleviate the need for a finger prick calibration. However given most diabetics will take at least one finger prick measurement during the day, this technology is not essential for the success of Nemaura’s CGM and sugarBEAT device. Pharma shall develop and commercialize the licensed products and meet certain manufacturing and commercialization milestones.  If Pharma fails to meet the milestones, Bath has the right, but not the obligation, to give written notice to Pharma of the failure and provide Pharma with an additional four months to remedy such failure, and if it’s not remedied within that time, Bath has the right to make the license non-exclusive in respect of those analytes for which the milestones have not been achieved.  If Bath fails to give such notice following six (6) months of the end of the cure period it shall be deemed to have waived its right to make the Licence non-exclusive. As consideration for the license, Pharma paid Bath an insignificant upfront fee, and shall make milestone payments and pay a royalty on gross receipts from income on the sales of the products.  The agreement shall terminate upon expiration of all the patents, unless earlier terminated by Bath, or by Pharma.  The last patent terminates on June 21, 2021.  Pharma have the right to terminate this agreement upon three months’ written notice and Bath may terminate immediately upon written notice due to the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, our failure to make payments under the agreement, a material breach under the agreement, a petition, notice, resolution or order made in connection with winding up our business or for the appointment of an administrator, and other triggering events.
 
On July 9, 2014, the license agreement with Bath was assigned by Pharma to DDL by way of a Novation Agreement with Bath, and DDL assumed all rights and obligations thereunder.  All references to obligations above by Pharma are therefore assumed by DDL as of the date of the Novation agreement. At the time of the assignment of the license from Pharma to us, Bath had verbally agreed with us to extend the deadlines for achieving those milestones, but the new dates have not yet been determined and a formal written agreement has not yet been executed.  To date the technology underlying the Bath license agreement has not been, as is not required to be, incorporated into the Company’s technology platform, which platform is sufficient for us to commercialize the sugarBEAT device.  Future milestone payments and royalties to Bath are payable only if the Company determines to utilize the Bath technology.
 
On May 8, 2014, NDM Technologies Limited, a related company, assigned the UK patent application 1208950.4 and International (PCT) patent application PCT/GB2013/051322 entitled "Cumulative Measurement of an Analyte" to DDL for a nominal consideration. In addition, on May 8, 2014, Pharma, assigned the family of patents relating to the patents and patent applications entitled "Patches for Reverse Iontophoresis" to DDL for a nominal consideration.
 
These patent and license assignments cover aspects of the technology platform. Accordingly, all intellectual property essential to the sugarBEAT product is owned by the Company, and not subject to royalty payments.We intend to take the lead in the preservation and/or prosecution of these patents and patent applications going forward as required. It will be appreciated that the nature of Research and Development and commercialisation means there is a constant evolution and maturity of the product and technology and manufacture processes, until the point of commercialisation and often beyond. Additional patents will be filed as the development progresses, where deemed to be of value to protecting the technology platform and future modifications and improvements. Where patents cannot be secured, the intellectual property will be limited to know-how and trade secrets, and these will be diligently guarded.

* In reverse Iontophoresis two electrodes, small thin metal discs are positioned on the skin with a small gap of a few centimetres between the two electrodes. A small battery like that used in some watches is then attached to the electrodes, and when connected a small charge/current flows just below the skin that is in the region between the electrodes. As a result of this molecules such as glucose that are present just below the skin get pulled out of the skin with the flow of the charge/current to one of the electrodes. A sensor present at that electrode measures the amount of glucose that has been pulled out of the skin with the flow of the charge/current. This is quantified and correlated with the blood glucose using a mathematical formula.

Clinical Trials
 
Our clinical testing is conducted by contract clinical research organizations in various centres around the world to cover a wide demographic – including the Middle East, Asia, and Europe – and is managed by our in-house management team.
 
We have had 2 pre-submission meetings with the FDA whereby the regulatory approval route has been defined by the FDA as being PMA and clinical roadmap clarified. As a result, a detailed clinical plan has been developed and approved internally and a clinical site in Europe has been selected and audited and approved for commencement of clinical studies using the body worn transmitter device version of the sugarBEAT.
 
Research and development
 
We spent $1,034,605 and $1,028,224 in 2017 and 2016, respectively on research and development. We anticipate that for the year ending March 2018, research and development expenditures will increase to further develop the device for commercial launch in the UK and Europe.
 
Development and clinical test costs in support of our current product, as well as costs to file patents and revise and update previous filings on our technologies, will continue to be substantial as we assess the next steps to advance the product. 
 
Current Development and Commercial Status
 
We perform medical device research and manufacturing of a glucose monitoring system named 'sugarBEAT.' The sugarBEAT device is a non-invasive, wireless device for use by persons with Type I and Type II diabetes, and may also be used to screen pre-diabetic patients. The sugarBEAT device extracts analytes, such as glucose, to the surface of the skin in a non-invasive manner where it is measured using unique sensors and the signal is processed and converted to glucose readings using algorithms. The original version of this technology consisted of a device designed for clinical use, which was directly connected to a patch containing a sensor. This device did not have any wireless methods of data transport and all data transport was using a USB cable. The clinical device has been further developed and is available in two variants for all future applications:
 
(1) The first of these variants consists of a patch containing a sensor that is applied to the skin. Glucose is extracted from the skin into the patch and the raw data is wirelessly sent to a reader. This reader may be a discrete hand-held device specifically produced for the sugarBEAT or it may be a smart phone or smart watch. The reader processes the raw data using algorithms and presents these as glucose readings.
 
(2) The second variant consists of a watch-like device with a screen, and the device directly connects to the patch containing a sensor (using a wire) and provides direct glucose readings on the screen.
 
We have undertaken a CE approval, which is the process to achieve a mandatory conformity marking for the sugarBEAT device to allow it to be legally sold in the European Union. It is a manufacturers' declaration that the product meets the requirements of the applicable European laws.  In 2015, we applied to obtain the CE approval for our clinical CGM sugarBEAT system.  In February 2016, the CE certificate was granted.
 
Since our first CE mark application for sugarBEAT, we have created a new version of the CGM.  The new device iterations are as described above, as variant 1 and 2, with the two key differences being firstly the new devices are smaller than the first device produced, and secondly the new devices have wireless communication means in the form of Bluetooth. It is our intent to submit a new CE mark application in Q3 2017 for the body worn transmitter device.  Although at this time we may not seek to commercially market and sell the initial sugarBeat device, we may continue to use it in clinics, or sell it as an introductory product in the event there are delays in securing CE approval of the variants for the new version of the CGM.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We intend to lead in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative and targeted diagnostic medical devices that improve disease monitoring, management and overall patient care. We plan to take the following steps to implement our broad business strategy.  Our key commercial targets:

· | Develop our own specialty sales and marketing teams to market the sugarBEAT device in the European Union. We have a marketing license agreement for the UK and Republic of Ireland with DB Pharma (Jersey) Ltd. This agreement is in addition to the planned 50/50 joint venture agreement (currently in negotiation) with the same party for product launch in all territories in the EU outside of the UK, Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland.

· | Develop a Clinical and Commercialization Strategy for Product launch in the USA. We expect to conduct studies for a US PMA submission in 2017. In parallel we intend to investigate and develop the optimal product launch and commercialization strategy for the USA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand the indications for which the sugarBEAT device may be used. We believe that the sugarBEAT device may offer other significant benefits other than those found in the non-acute setting for the monitoring of other diseases. This includes monitoring of lactic acid for performance athletics as well as critical care, and the monitoring of drugs for clinical study programs. Initial proof of concept will be completed in laboratory settings followed by a clinical program.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand our product pipeline through our proprietary platform technologies, acquisitions and strategic licensing arrangements. We intend to leverage our proprietary platform technologies to grow our portfolio of product candidates for the diagnosis of diabetes and other diseases. In addition, we intend to license our product and acquire products and technologies that are consistent with our research and development and business focus and strategies including improved delivery systems for insulin and other diabetes related medicines that would complement the diagnostic platform, and enhance our position as a key player in the diabetes field.

--+---------------------------------------------------


- | Manufacturing agreements for the CGM watch device and transmitter device manufacture
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 
An Exclusive Marketing Rights agreement for the UK and Republic of Ireland was signed on March 31, 2014 with Dallas Burston Pharma, a Jersey (Channel Island) based company who has pharmaceutical product marketing operations in the UK and has demonstrated a very successful model for the marketing of prescription medical products directly to general practitioners. We received a non-refundable upfront payment of $1.67 million in return for providing the company with the exclusive right to sell the sugarBEAT device in the UK and Republic of Ireland, both direct to consumer and through prescriptions by general practitioners. Subsequently, on April 4, 2014, a Letter of Intent was entered into outlining the basic terms of the cost at which the patches and watch will be supplied and minimum order quantities in the first two (2) years. The key terms of the Exclusive Marketing Rights Agreement were concluded in a Commercial Agreement signed in August 2015.
 
In addition, we are in detailed discussions and negotiations with Dallas Burston Pharma (Jersey) Limited regarding a planned joint venture agreement whereby we will share the costs and net profits of the sales of our sugarBEAT system in all territories in Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, which is the subject of a separate agreement with Dallas Burston Pharma (Jersey) Limited. As of the current date, we have not finalized any joint venture agreement, although it is expected this agreement will be finalised by the end of August 2017.

Regulatory matters
 
Government authorities in the United Kingdom and Wales and the European Union as well as other foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labelling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing and import and export of medical devices, including patches and other pharmaceutical products. Our Patches for Reverse Iontophoresis in the United Kingdom and Wales will be subject to strict regulation and require regulatory approval prior to commercial distribution. The process of obtaining governmental approvals and complying with ongoing regulatory requirements requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the authority's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. At this time, we are not seeking FDA approval and we are not seeking to conduct clinical studies or to market the sugarBEAT device in the United States.
 
The European Commission on Public Health (the "ECPH") provides the regulation for the development and commercialization of new medical diagnostic devices. Any medical device placed on the European market must comply with the relevant legislation, notably with Directive 93/42/EEC, with the active implantable devices Directive 90/385/EEC or with the in vitro devices Directive 98/79/EC. We must first determine whether the device we intend to manufacture or import falls under any of these directives. All medical devices must fulfil the essential requirements set out in the above-mentioned directives. Where available, relevant standards may be used to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements defined in the devices Directives. 
 
Manufacturers also need to determine the appropriate conformity assessment route. For devices falling under Directive 93/42/EEC, other than custom-made devices and devices intended for clinical investigation, the conformity assessment route depends on the class of the device, to be determined in accordance with certain rules set forth in the directives. Once the applicable class or list has been determined, manufacturers need to follow the appropriate conformity assessment procedure. Subject to the type of the device, this may require manufacturers to have their quality systems and technical documentation reviewed by a Notified Body before they can place their products on the market. A Notified Body is a third party body that can carry out a conformity assessment recognized by the European Union. The Notified Body will need to assure itself that relevant requirements have been met before issuing relevant certification. Manufacturers can then place the CE marking on their products to demonstrate compliance with the requirements.
 
The CE approval is the process of achieving a mandatory conformity marking for the sugarBEAT device to allow it to be legally sold in the European Union. It is a manufacturers' declaration that the product meets the requirements of the applicable European laws. The process for the sugarBEAT device CE submission and approval will involve the following:
 
1. The device is classified depending on certain categories described by the European Directive with Class I products being low risk (e.g. band aid plasters), through Class III devices being the highest risk. The classes are Class I, IIa, IIb and III. Risk is based upon the potential harm to the patient should a problem arise with a product or its use. The sugarBEAT device is classed as a IIa device.
 
2. A 'technical file' containing all of the information required to demonstrate that the product meets the essential requirements of the European directive will be prepared. This includes information relating to performance and safety of the device such as product specifications, labelling, instructions for use, risk analysis and specific test information/clinical evidence relating to the product that support the claims being made for the product.
 
3. Clinical evidence included in the technical file will demonstrate that the device is safe and meets defined performance requirements. This clinical evidence can be in the form of literature data where substantial published data exists that utilizes the same technique for glucose extraction and measurement (albeit in a different device format), or data from actual clinical studies performed using the sugarBEAT device. The first CE mark submission will be based on literature evaluation of 3rd party published clinical data available in the public domain. The final CE mark submission with final claims will be based on literature evaluation and actual clinical data from human clinical studies performed using the sugarBEAT device. The clinical data will be generated to show that the sugarBEAT device can trend blood glucose levels in a human subject by taking measurements up to 4 times per hour. The clinical trial data must demonstrate the sugarBEAT device blood glucose trend can be used to supplement normal finger prick measurements.

4. The technical file will be assessed by an independent inspector (the Notified Body), regulated by the competent authority, (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA in the United Kingdom). The Notified Body (an organization in the European Union that has been accredited by a member state to determine whether a medical device complies with the European medical device directives), will then notify The European Commission on Public Health (the "ECPH") of the approval and a certificate will be issued to the company by the notified body and we will then be able to apply the CE mark to the device, and legally offer the product for sale in the European Economic Area (EEA).
 
5. The review of the technical file typically takes a matter of days although the lead time can be 6-8 weeks depending upon the notified body, and approval is usually attained within 3 months of submission.
 
6. Generating the information required to complete the technical file takes the most time and this information is collated throughout the product development cycle. Delays arise where the company has not consulted its Notified Body prior to technical file review and elements may require further detail before the Notified Body can confirm that the device meets the essential requirements. This could delay an approval process by several weeks or in more drastic cases by several months depending on the time taken to provide any additional information requested by the Notified Body. Nemaura has been in regular communication with the Notified Body throughout the development of the sugarBEAT device, and continues to do so for the forthcoming CE submissions.
 
Other Regulation in the United Kingdom and Wales and the EU
 
Healthcare Reimbursement
 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United Kingdom and Wales. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical products. Government programs, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for products. Some third-party payers must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical product may have been cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the product until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers.
Environmental Regulation
 
We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United Kingdom and Wales. Like many other medical device companies, our operations involve the use of substances, including hazardous wastes, which are regulated under environmental laws, primarily manufacturing and sterilization processes. We do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. These laws and regulations are all subject to change, however, and we cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Foreign Regulation
 
Whether or not we obtain regulatory approval for a product, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for EC approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications under a decentralized procedure. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. This procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure, or called the MRP.
 
In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States. We face the risk that the prices which result from the regulatory approval process would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our collaborators.
