ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
Asure Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a global provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) time and labor management and Agile Workplace management solutions that enable organizations to manage their office environments as well as their human resource and payroll processes effectively and efficiently.
 
Asure serves approximately 7,000 clients in 80 countries, ranging from global Fortune 500 clients to small and mid-sized businesses. Some of our current clients include Aetna, Apple Inc., Baker & McKenzie, Deutsche Bank, KPMG UK, La Trobe University, Merck and Co., Inc., Mondelez, Pfizer, Inc., Pearson, PSSI, Salesforce.com, Inc., State Street and Thomson Reuters. Our mission guides the work we do each day; it is “To deliver innovative technology with the passion to empower every client’s workplace and the commitment to make their workdays easier.”
 
We currently offer a full suite of solutions to help clients optimize and manage their mobile workforces and their global workspaces. SaaS-based offerings include: asset management, mobile room scheduling, mobile time tracking, scheduling software, space utilization solutions, tablet-based time clocks, time and labor management software, traditional time clocks, touch panels for room scheduling, and workplace business intelligence (“BI”) analytics, as well as human resource management, payroll processing and benefits administration services businesses. All products are implemented using our proven client deployment model and supported with professional services and client support teams as needed.
 
More than ever, companies are trying to get a handle on how to track, understand and optimize their real estate and time and labor costs in a world that is becoming increasingly mobile and global. With tele-commuting, hoteling (i.e., sharing of cubical space), and alternative working on the rise, executives have an opportunity to reinvent their workspaces to better meet the needs of their workforces and save millions in real estate costs. Similarly, mobile time tracking with geospatial and facial recognition technologies allows executives to better understand where and when their employees are working, and provides great insights into optimizing labor schedules and labor costs. Mobile time and tablet-based time tracking solutions also help combat “buddy punching”- when a dishonest worker covers for an absent co-worker by punching the company time clock for the absent worker- which can cost companies millions of dollars per year.
 
We were incorporated in 1985 and our principal executive offices are located at 110 Wild Basin Road, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78746.  Our telephone number is (512) 437-2700 and our website is www.asuresoftware.com.  Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Asure makes available free of charge, on or through its website, our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials or furnish them to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
Public Stock Offering 
 
In December 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of 1,949,250 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $8.00 per share, which includes 254,250 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option. Our net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses, were approximately $14.4 million. We intend to use the net proceeds received from the offering for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, assets or technologies. We subsequently used a portion of the proceeds to reduce approximately $3.0 million of our secured subordinated indebtedness payable in connection with the 2016 acquisition of Mangrove and for the three acquisitions we closed in January 2017, as noted below.
2017 Acquisitions
 
In January 2017, we closed three strategic acquisitions: Personnel Management Systems, Inc., a leading provider of outsourced HR solutions; Corporate Payroll, Inc. (Payroll Division), a leading provider of payroll services; and Payroll Specialties NW, Inc., a leading provider of payroll services.

2016 Acquisitions
 
Through the acquisitions described below, we have entered into the human resource management, payroll processing and benefits administration services businesses, which we have integrated into our existing AsureForce® product line.
Mangrove Stock Acquisition
 
In March 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Mangrove Employer Services, Inc.  (“Mangrove”), a human resource management and payroll processing company based in Tampa, Florida. The aggregate consideration for the stock consisted of (i) $11.3 million in cash, and (ii) a secured subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of $6.0 million, subject to adjustment.
COBRAsource Asset Acquisition
 
In March 2016, we also acquired substantially all the assets of Mangrove COBRAsource Inc., a benefits administration services business which then was a wholly owned subsidiary of Mangrove. The aggregate consideration for the assets was $1.0 million.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
Asure’s SaaS-based solutions are uniquely designed to help companies bring people, time, space and assets together to more effectively manage their global, mobile workforces. As companies recruit, hire and work to retain mobile employees, executives use Asure’s solutions to understand how their workspaces are used, track how and when people work, and foster productivity by making it easy for employees to find the workspace they need. We currently offer two main product lines, AsureSpace™ and AsureForce®.  AsureSpace™ provides workplace management solutions that enable organizations to manage their office environments and optimize real estate utilization, and AsureForce® time and labor management solutions help organizations optimize labor and labor administration costs and activities.
 
With AsureSpace™ workspace management solutions, clients realize significant costs savings and Return on Investment (“ROI”) gains by better using their real estate with a full portfolio of industry-leading, global, SaaS-based solutions. Our SmartView® product offers unique insights into how space is being used, which allows companies to make proactive, strategic decisions about real estate investments. SmartTag® asset management helps companies assign physical assets to people and spaces so they can track and recover all assets, including cell phones, laptops, desks, chairs, and virtually any item assigned to an employee. AsureSpace™ resource scheduling and meeting room management solutions help employees easily find and reserve space for their specific needs. Our new product, NowSpace®, allows users to find and reserve desk spaces, conference rooms, catering, audiovisual, and more directly from their smart phones. AsureSpace™ touch panels and kiosks are placed outside busy areas for on-the-fly desk and space reservation needs; viewers can find, reserve and use available space as needed. And lastly, workplace business intelligence (“Workplace BI”) tools offer invaluable reporting for executives to understand space utilization and continue to make improvements in their real estate investments.

Mangrove, which was acquired in March 2016, and is now a part of our AsureForce® product line, provides cloud-based SaaS Human Capital Management (“HCM”) applications which includes human resources (“HR”), payroll, benefits, and talent management software solutions. Mangrove’s HCM suite of solutions is easy-to-use, with fully integrated HR/payroll applications uniquely designed to help companies recruit, manage, pay, and analyze their workforce more effectively.
 
The acquisition enabled us to alter the marketplace of HCM by offering a comprehensive solution that brings workforce and workspace management together. These two workflows combined in one unified management platform increases company bottom-line performance through greater employee empowerment and engagement. It also gives companies new data metrics to manage their two most costly assets: their people and real estate.
 
Cost savings and additional ROI gains come in the form of a more strategic use of labor dollars and the elimination of time theft with AsureForce® workforce management solutions.  GeoPunch® mobile time tracking, the AirClock™ tablet-based time tracking, and Asure’s workforce management platform offer clients several advantages. First, mobile time tracking with geospatial and facial recognition technologies help executives better understand where and when their employees are working and provide great insights into optimizing labor schedules and labor costs. Mobile time and tablet-based time tracking solutions make it much more efficient for employees to punch in and out from wherever they are working, whether it is a client site, a work site, or a home-based work arrangement. GeoPunch® and AirClock™ also help combat buddy punching, which can cost companies millions of dollars per year. Finally, employees, supervisors and executives have real-time access to data and business intelligence to help eliminate buddy punching, optimize job costing and labor scheduling, and ultimately control and optimize labor costs.
 
For both product lines, support and professional services are other key elements of our software and services business. As an extension of our legacy perpetual software product offerings, Asure offers our customers maintenance and support contracts that provide ready access to qualified support staff, software patches and upgrades to our software products.   We also provide installation of and training on our products, add-on software customization and other professional services on a global scale.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
We strive to quickly bring to market innovative, cloud-based solutions that work when, where and how workforces are operating today. Asure’s strategy is to deliver the right technology to its customer base in order to realize efficiencies in the workplace. First-to-market mobile applications are a testament to our success in innovation. Additionally, Asure is committed to co-innovation, working in partnership with industry leaders, partners and clients around the globe to develop technology solutions that meet the needs of a rapidly shifting workplace.
 
Our industry is characterized by continuing improvements in technology, resulting in the frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, changes in customer needs and continual improvement in product performance characteristics.   Asure strives to be cost-effective and timely in enhancing our software applications, developing new innovative software solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of an evolving range of customers, and anticipating technological advances and evolving industry standards and practices.
 
Asure development teams – located in Traverse City, Michigan; Dedham, Massachusetts; Salt Lake City, Utah and Austin, Texas – are staffed with software developers, quality assurance engineers and support specialists who work closely with our customers and sales and marketing teams to build products and services based on market requirements and customer feedback.  We develop our new product and service roadmaps based on inputs from customers, competitive comparisons and relevant technology innovations. 
 
Our research and development strategy is rooted in innovation and flexibility. The development team enhances the functionality of our software and hardware products through new releases and new feature developments, with a particular focus on cloud-based SaaS solutions and products for the mobile workforce.  Asure will also continue to evaluate opportunities for developing new software so that organizations may further streamline and automate the tasks associated with administering their businesses.  We seek to simultaneously allow organizations to improve their productivity while reducing the costs associated with those business tasks.
 
We also actively search for potential product, service or business acquisitions that we believe will complement our existing and planned product and service offerings, such as our 2016 Mangrove human capital management, payroll processing and employee benefits administration acquisitions.  We cannot assure that we will make future acquisitions or that we can successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses profitably into Asure.
 
Despite our efforts, we also cannot assure that we will complete our existing and future development efforts or that our new and enhanced software products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance.  Additionally, Asure may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development or introduction of new or enhanced software products.  In the case of acquiring new or complementary software products or technologies, we may not be able to integrate the acquisitions into our current product lines.  Furthermore, despite extensive testing, errors may be found in new software products or releases after shipment, resulting in a diversion of development resources, increased service costs, loss of revenue and/or delay in market acceptance.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
 
Asure sells its software products and services through both a direct and channel (partner) model, which enables us to sell our software solutions in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Prospective customers learn about Asure through a variety of ways, including advertising, web site searches, sales calls, public relations, direct marketing and social media.  When prospective customers show an interest in Asure, we connect them with a sales representative via our web site, phone or a face-to-face meeting to discuss their needs and the solutions they are interested in and make the sale.  We track our marketing and sales activities to provide immediate preview into activities, leads and pipeline opportunities. Asure account management teams also work with existing customers to promote and sell additional solutions that are relevant for each customer. In addition to this direct sales model, we supplement these efforts with our partner programs described below.  By working with our partners, we expand the reach of our direct sales force and gain access to key opportunities in major market segments worldwide.  Asure has two distinct levels of partners in our Partner Program: Reseller Partners and Referral Partners.
Reseller Partners. Reseller Partners are companies that represent us globally, as well as before the Federal government, and often offer complementary products to either the workspace management product line or the workforce product line.  Reseller Partners commit to a minimum level of business per year with us and receive a channel discount for that commitment.  Our Reseller Partners outside the United States include Novera in Australia which represents the workspace product line.  We also have several Reseller Partners that represent our software in the Federal government space.  Resellers of our workforce product line in the United States include Oasis Outsourcing, a large provider of human resource outsourcing solutions. 
Referral Partners.  Referral Partners provide us with the name and particular information about a prospective customer and its needs as a sales lead.  If we accept the sales lead, we register it for the Referral Partner.  If we make a sale as a direct result of such a lead, we will pay the Referral Partner a sales lead referral fee.  Currently, we have a number of Referral Partners, including PolyVision Corp., Steelcase and e-Innovative Solutions for the workspace management product line and several smaller firms for our workforce product line.
COMPETITION
 
We believe we have a unique position in the market place, in that Asure is the only technology company in the world that offers SaaS-based workspace and workforce management solutions from a single partner. Additionally, we believe Asure has been first-to-market with mobile apps in the workspace management industry and we are the only known company to have both geospatial and facial recognition technology working together for mobile time tracking.
 
 Specific to the AsureSpace™ line of workspace management software solutions, we have a competitive advantage in the breadth of our comprehensive platform of workspace scheduling and utilization analytics as well as our resources available for product development, client services, and customer support. The primary competitors to AsureSpace™ include Dean Evans & Associates, Inc., Emergingsoft Corporation, AgilQuest Corporation and Condeco Ltd. (UK). In addition to the features and available services, we believe the principal advantages of AsureSpace™ with respect to its competitors include its cloud-based services model, extensive product integration options and partner channel, scalable deployments, configurable interfaces, mobile access and price.
 
We believe that the AsureForce® line of workforce management software solutions has a competitive advantage in the marketplace in serving organizations seeking specific point-solutions as well as organizations desiring an integrated suite of solutions, particularly in the area of mobile time collection. We believe GeoPunch® and AirClock™ products are first-to-market technology solutions with significant market demand. By competing tactically with point-solutions and strategically with an integrated suite of solutions, Asure can serve the needs of a broad spectrum of companies. Primary competitors to AsureForce® include Kronos, Replicon, and Time Simplicity.
 
While Asure has the advantage of a flexible, easy to use, cloud-based, SaaS-delivered software model, affordability and proven deployment methodology, we face several categories of competitive challenges:
 
Vendors with face-to-face sales contact. In this highly relationship-based sales process, vendors with large, dispersed field-based sales teams who meet and consult with prospects have an advantage. Key U.S. vendors who approach the market in this manner include ADP, Kronos, PeopleSoft, Condeco and Steelcase. Asure has recently launched a field-based approach to sales and also focuses on high-touch marketing campaigns and leveraging relationships with channel partners to build relationships with prospects.
 
National payroll processors with loss-leader products. Large brand and market share payroll processing vendors (such as ADP, Inc.) offer equivalent point solutions at little or no cost to prospects when in a competitive engagement because these loss leader products become inconsequential next to their core business offerings.
 
Single application vendors. Vendors that offer similar point-solutions, such as room scheduling, office hoteling management, time and attendance, employee/manager self-service and paystub management, can be perceived as better meeting an immediate and specific need.

Because the market for our products and services is subject to rapid technological change and there are relatively low barriers to entry in the workplace management software market, we routinely encounter new entrants or competition from vendors in some or all aspects of our two product lines. Competition from these potential market entrants may take many forms. Some of our competitors, both current and future, may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. As a result, they may compete more effectively on price and other terms. Additionally, those competitors may devote greater resources in developing products or in promoting and selling their products to achieve greater market acceptance. Asure is actively taking measures designed to address our competitive challenges. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to achieve or maintain a competitive advantage with respect to any of the competitive factors.
 
MARKETING
 
Asure’s marketing strategy has relied on the development and implementation of a comprehensive integrated plan rooted in our business objectives.  The marketing plan includes four primary objectives: 1) build brand awareness, 2) develop lead generation programs that drive revenue, 3) launch products in a meaningful way and 4) develop an infrastructure that supports and measures marketing activities. We deploy multi-faceted, multi-series direct marketing programs to drive awareness, interest and revenue. Marketing vehicles include our web site, organic and paid search, advertising, public relations, direct marketing, events, social media, content marketing and eMarketing.  Our marketing plan addresses growth and retention goals for all target audiences, from small and medium-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies and divisions of enterprise organizations throughout the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific.  
INDUSTRY REGULATION
 
Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.
 
As a provider of HR outsourcing solutions, we process personal and sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and data security-related laws. For instance, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our COBRA, flexible spending account, and health savings account benefits administration services businesses. We are also subject to federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data.
 
Some of our solutions assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them.  For example, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States. Our COBRA administration services and flexible spending account services in the United States are designed to help our clients comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to, respectively, employers’ benefits continuation obligations and certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to us, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services.
 
Additionally, the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, Canada, the European Union and elsewhere, may impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. For example, the European Union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation (the “GDPR”) in May 2016 that will replace the current EU Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation.  The GDPR becomes fully effective in May 2018. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. Failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences
 
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business.

TRADEMARKS
 
We have registered Asure Software® as a federal trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Our other federal trademarks include AsureForce®, Face Time Clock®, Legiant Timecard® and ADI Time®, and we have pending applications for federal registration of the marks AsureSpace™, SmartView™ and GeoPunch™. We also use the common law trademarks iEmployee™, Netsimplicty™, AsureSpace™, ADI™, Workplace BI™ and Legiant Express™.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 179 employees in the following departments:
 

 | NUMBER OF | 
--------------------------------------------+-----------+----
FUNCTION | EMPLOYEES | 
Research and development | | 31 
Sales and marketing | | 39 
Customer service and technical support | | 66 
Finance, human resources and administration | | 43 
Total | | 179

 
We continually evaluate and adjust the size and composition of our workforce. We also periodically retain contractors to support our sales and marketing, information technology and administrative functions.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.  Asure has not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.  Additionally, we augment our workforce capacity in research and development and customer service and technical support by contracting for services through third parties.
 
Our future performance depends largely on our ability to continually and effectively attract, train, retain, motivate and manage highly qualified and experienced technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel.  Asure’s future development and growth depend on the efforts of key management personnel and technical employees. Asure uses incentives, including competitive compensation and stock options, to attract and retain well-qualified employees. However, we cannot assure that we will continue to attract and retain personnel with the requisite capabilities and experience. The loss of one or more of Asure’s key management or technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.
