Item 1.  Business
Summit Financial Group, Inc. (“Company” or “Summit”) is a $3.11 billion financial holding company headquartered in Moorefield, West Virginia incorporated on March 5, 1987.  We provide community banking services primarily in the Eastern Panhandle, Southern and North Central regions of West Virginia, the Northern, Shenandoah Valley and Southwestern regions of Virginia and the Central region of Kentucky.  We provide these services through our community bank subsidiary, Summit Community Bank (“Summit Community” or “Bank”).  
Community Banking 
We provide a wide range of community banking services, including demand, savings and time deposits; commercial, real estate and consumer loans; trust and wealth management services; and cash management services.  The deposits of Summit Community are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC").
In order to compete with other financial service providers, we principally rely upon personal relationships established by our officers, directors and employees with our clients and specialized services tailored to meet our clients’ needs.  We have maintained a strong community orientation by, among other things, supporting the active participation of staff members in local charitable, civic, school, religious and community development activities.  We also have a marketing program that primarily utilizes local radio and newspapers to advertise.  Banking, like most industries, is becoming more dependent on technology as a means of marketing to customers, including the Internet, which we also utilize.  This approach, coupled with continuity of service by the same staff members, enables Summit Community to develop long-term customer relationships, maintain high quality service and respond quickly to customer needs.  We believe that our emphasis on local relationship banking, together with a prudent approach to lending, are important factors in our success and growth.
All operational and support functions that are transparent to clients are centralized in order to achieve consistency and cost efficiencies in the delivery of products and services by each banking office.  The central office provides services such as data processing, deposit operations, accounting, treasury management, loan administration, loan review, compliance, risk management and internal auditing to enhance our delivery of quality service.  We also provide overall direction in the areas of credit policy and administration, strategic planning, marketing, investment portfolio management, human resources administration and other financial and administrative services. The banking offices work closely with us to develop new products and services needed by their customers and to introduce enhancements to existing products and services.
Lending
Our primary lending focus is providing commercial loans to local businesses with annual sales generally up to $75 million and providing owner-occupied real estate loans to individuals.  We typically do not seek credit relationships of more than $25 million but will consider larger lending relationships exhibiting above-average credit quality.  Under our commercial banking strategy, we focus on offering a broad line of financial products and services to small and medium-sized businesses through full service banking offices.  Summit Community Bank has senior management with extensive lending experience.  These managers exercise substantial authority over credit and pricing decisions, subject to loan committee approval for larger credits.
We segment our loan portfolio in to the following major lending categories: commercial, commercial real estate, construction and land development, residential real estate, consumer and mortgage warehouse lines of credit. Commercial loans are loans made to commercial borrowers that are not secured by real estate. These encompass loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, as well as unsecured loans. Commercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages, which generally are secured by nonresidential and multi-family residential properties. Commercial real estate loans are made to many of the same customers and carry similar industry risks as the commercial loan portfolio. Construction and development loans are loans made for the purpose of financing construction or development projects. This portfolio includes commercial and residential land development loans, one-to-four family housing construction, both pre-sold and speculative in nature, multi-family housing construction, non-residential building construction and undeveloped land. Residential real estate loans are mortgage loans to consumers and are secured primarily by a first lien deed of trust. These loans are traditional one-to-four family residential mortgages. Also included in this category of loans are second liens on one-to-four family properties, commercial loans secured by one-to-four family residence and home equity loans. Consumer loans are loans that establish consumer credit that is granted for the consumer’s personal use. These loans include automobile loans and recreational vehicle loans, as well as personal secured and unsecured loans. Our mortgage warehouse lines of credit result solely from a participation arrangement with a regional bank to fund residential mortgage warehouse lines of medium- and large-sized mortgage originators located throughout the United States.
 Our loan underwriting guidelines and standards are consistent with the prudent banking practices applicable to the relevant exposure and are updated periodically and presented to the Board of Directors for approval. The purpose of these standards and guidelines are:  to grant loans on a sound and collectible basis; to invest available funds in a safe and profitable manner; to serve the legitimate credit needs of our primary market area; and to ensure that all loan applicants receive fair and equal treatment in the lending process. It is the intent of the underwriting guidelines and standards to: minimize losses by carefully investigating the credit history of each applicant; verify the source of repayment and the ability of the applicant to repay; collateralize those loans in which collateral is deemed to be required; exercise care in the documentation of the application, review, approval and origination process; and administer a comprehensive loan collection program.
Our real estate underwriting loan-to-value (“LTV”) policy limits are at or below current bank regulatory guidelines, as follows:

 | RegulatoryLTVGuideline | SummitLTVPolicy Limit
Undeveloped land | 65% | 65% 
Land development | 75% | 70% 
Land development - Finished building lots | 85% | 85% 
Construction: | | 
Commercial, multifamily and other non-residential | 80% | 80% 
1-4 family residential, consumer borrower | 85% | 85% 
1-4 family residential, pre-sold commercial borrower | 80% | 80% 
1-4 family residential, spec, commercial borrower | 80% | 70% 
Improved property: | | 
Residential real estate - nonowner occupied | 85% | 85% 
Commercial real estate - owner occupied | 85% | 85% 
Commercial real estate - nonowner occupied | 85% | 85% 
Owner occupied 1-4 family | 90% | 90% 
Home equity | 90% | 90% 

Exceptions are permitted to these regulatory guidelines as long as such exceptions are identified, monitored and reported to the Board of Directors at least quarterly and the total of such exceptions do not exceed 100% of Summit Community’s total regulatory capital, which totaled $302.7 million as of December 31, 2020.  As of this date, we had loans approximating $99.9 million which exceeded the above regulatory LTV guidelines, as follows:

Undeveloped land | $ | 5.8 | million
Land development | $ | 5.8 | million
Land development - Finished building lots | $ | 3.6 | million
Construction: | | 
Commercial, multifamily and other non-residential | $ | 1.3 | million
1-4 family residential, consumer borrower | $ | 0.2 | million
1-4 family residential, pre-sold, commercial borrower | $ | 1.2 | million
1-4 family residential, spec, commercial borrower | $ | 3.7 | million
Improved property: | | 
Residential real estate - nonowner occupied | $ | 9.4 | million
Commercial real estate - owner occupied | $ | 21.0 | million
Commercial real estate - nonowner occupied | $ | 24.8 | million
Owner occupied 1-4 family | $ | 22.6 | million
Home equity | $ | 0.5 | million

Our underwriting standards and practice are designed to originate both fixed and variable rate loan products, consistent with the underwriting guidelines discussed above. Adjustable rate and variable rate loans are underwritten, giving consideration both to the loan’s initial rate and to higher assumed rates, commensurate with reasonably anticipated market conditions.  Accordingly, we want to insure that adequate primary repayment capacity exists to address both future increases in interest rates and fluctuations in the underlying cash flows available for repayment.  Historically, we have not offered “payment option ARM” loans.  Further, we have had no loan portfolio products which were specifically designed for “sub-prime” borrowers (defined as consumers with a credit score of less than 599).
Supervision and Regulation
General
We are subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and other federal and state regulators.  As a financial holding company, we are subject to the restrictions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), are registered pursuant to its provisions and are subject to examination by the FRB.  As a financial holding company doing business in West Virginia, we are also subject to regulation by and must submit annual reports to the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions.
The BHCA prohibits the acquisition by a financial holding company of direct or indirect ownership of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of any bank within the United States without prior approval of the FRB. With certain exceptions, a financial holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging directly or indirectly in business unrelated to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks.
The FRB, in its Regulation Y, permits financial holding companies to engage in non-banking activities closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks.  Approval of the FRB is necessary to engage in these activities or to make acquisitions of corporations engaging in these activities as the FRB determines whether these acquisitions or activities are in the public interest. In addition, by order, and on a case by case basis, the FRB may approve other non-banking activities.
The BHCA permits us to purchase or redeem our own securities.  However, Regulation Y provides that prior notice must be given to the FRB if the total consideration for such purchase or consideration, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by us for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months is equal to ten percent (10%) or more of our consolidated net worth.  Prior notice is not required if (i) both before and immediately after the redemption, the financial holding company is well capitalized; (ii) the financial holding company is well managed and (iii) the financial holding company is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules (the “Capital Simplifications Rules”) that, among other things, eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, Summit’s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
The FRB has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations.  The FRB also can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution.  The penalties can be as high as $1 million for each day the activity continues.
Summit Community, our only bank subsidiary, is subject to West Virginia banking statutes and regulations, and is primarily regulated by the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions and the FDIC.  The Bank is also subject to regulations promulgated by the FRB.  As a member of the FDIC, Summit Community’s deposits are insured as required by federal law.  Bank regulatory authorities regularly examine revenues, loans, investments, management practices and other aspects of Summit Community.  These examinations are conducted primarily to protect depositors and not shareholders.  In addition to these regular examinations, the Bank must furnish to regulatory authorities quarterly reports containing full and accurate statements of its affairs.
Because we are a public company, we are subject to regulation by the SEC.  SEC regulations require us to disclose certain types of business and financial data on a regular basis to the SEC and to our shareholders.  We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC.  We prepare and file an annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC that contains detailed financial and operating information, as well as a management response to specific questions about our operations.  SEC regulations require that our annual reports to shareholders contain certified financial statements and other specific items such as management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations.  We must also file quarterly reports with the SEC on Form 10-Q that contain detailed financial and operating information for the prior quarter and we must file current reports on Form 8-K to provide the pubic with information on recent material events.
In addition to periodic reporting to the SEC, we are subject to proxy rules and tender offer rules issued by the SEC.  Our officers, directors and principal shareholders (holding 10% or more of our stock) must also submit reports to the SEC regarding 
their holdings of our stock and any changes to such holdings and they are subject to short-swing profit liability.  Because we are traded on the NASDAQ, we are also subject to the listing standards of NASDAQ.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010

The “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which is complex and broad in scope, established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the “CFPB”), which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring systemic risk.  We will be required to comply with the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the CFPB’s rules; however, these rules will be enforced by Summit Community's primary regulator, the FDIC, not the CFPB.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act alters the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies, implements certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies, including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders and certain whistleblower provisions and restricts certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates.  Although the regulations that directly affect our business have been adopted, many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to final rulemaking by the U.S. financial regulatory agencies and the implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our business will depend to some extent on how such rules are adopted and implemented by the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies.
Bank Holding Company Activities

In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the FRB), without prior approval of the FRB.

Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. Some examples of non-banking activities which presently may be performed by a financial holding company are: making or acquiring, for its own account or the account of others, loans and other extensions of credit; operating as an industrial bank, or industrial loan company, in the manner authorized by state law; servicing loans and other extensions of credit; performing or carrying on any one or more of the functions or activities that may be performed or carried on by a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law; acting as an investment or financial advisor; leasing real or personal property; making equity or debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare, such as the economic rehabilitation and the development of low income areas; providing bookkeeping services or financially oriented data processing services for the holding company and its subsidiaries; acting as an insurance agent or a broker; acting as an underwriter for credit life insurance, which is directly related to extensions of credit by the financial holding company system; providing courier services for certain financial documents; providing management consulting advice to non-affiliated banks; selling retail money orders having a face value of not more than $1,000, traveler’s checks and U.S. savings bonds; performing appraisals of real estate; arranging commercial real estate equity financing under certain limited circumstances; providing securities brokerage services related to securities credit activities; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; providing foreign exchange advisory and transactional services; and acting, under certain circumstances, as futures commission merchant for non-affiliated persons in the execution and clearance on major commodity exchanges of futures contracts and options.

To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and “well managed.” A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be “well capitalized” if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned “Capital Requirements” included elsewhere in this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered “well managed” if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination. A financial holding company’s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as “well capitalized” and “well managed’ under applicable FRB regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the FRB’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions. 
Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.

In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. See the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act” included elsewhere in this item.

The FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

The Dodd-Frank Act amends the BHC Act to require the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule”. In July, 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule implementing sections of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act to grant an exclusion from the Volcker Rule for community banks with few than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and total trading assets, as well as liabilities that are equal to or less than five percent of their total consolidated assets. Not only are we now excluded from the Volker Rule due to our asset size, the Volcker Rule has not had a material impact on our operations as we do not generally engage in activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule. 

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the West Virginia Banking Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FRB or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (see the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act” included elsewhere in this item) and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.

Dividends

The principal source of our liquidity is dividends from Summit Community. The prior approval of the Federal Reserve is required if the total of all dividends declared by a state-chartered member bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Federal law also prohibits a state-chartered, member bank from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank’s undivided profits. Summit Community is also subject to limitations under West Virginia state law regarding the level of dividends that may be paid.

In addition, the Company and Summit Community are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The appropriate federal regulatory authorities have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. 

Credit and Monetary Policies and Related Matters
Summit Community is affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, including the FRB.  An important function of these policies is to curb inflation and control recessions through control of the supply of money and credit.  The operations of Summit Community are affected by the policies of government regulatory authorities, including the FRB, which regulates money and credit conditions through open-market operations in United States Government and Federal agency securities, adjustments in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and requirements against deposits and regulation of interest rates payable by member banks on time and savings deposits.  These policies have a significant influence 
on the growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, and interest rates charged on loans, or paid for time and savings deposits, as well as yields on investments.  The FRB has had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future.  Future policies of the FRB and other authorities and their effect on future earnings cannot be predicted.
The FRB has a policy that a financial holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank.  Under the source of strength doctrine, the FRB may require a financial holding company to contribute capital to a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the financial holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank.  This capital injection may be required at times when Summit may not have the resources to provide it.  Any capital loans by a holding company to any subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank.  In addition, the Crime Control Act of 1990 provides that in the event of a financial holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by such holding company to a Federal bank or thrift regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Capital Requirements
Our bank subsidiary, Summit Community, is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking regulatory agencies. Under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Summit Community must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Summit Community’s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Summit Community to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1("CET1"), Total capital and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). Summit Community’s regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 are set forth in the table in Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 103. We believe, as of December 31, 2020, that our bank subsidiary met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject.
The most recent notifications from the banking regulatory agencies categorized Summit Community as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, Summit Community must maintain minimum CET1, Total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table in Note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page 103.
The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased-in over a multi-year schedule, and was fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Summit Community’s capital levels remained characterized as "well-capitalized" under the new rules. 
On August 28, 2018, the FRB issued an interim final rule expanding the applicability of the FRB's small bank holding company policy statement, as required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. The interim final rule raises the small bank holding company policy statement's asset threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion in total consolidated assets, and as a result, the Company was exempted from all regulatory capital guidelines, to which it previously had been subject, until such time as its consolidated assets exceed $3 billion.
On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to: (i) address the upcoming implementation of the Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL") accounting standard under GAAP; and (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations experienced upon adopting CECL. We implemented the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, whereby we increased the allowances for loan credit losses and unfunded commitments by $8.89 million and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $7.02 million (net of deferred income taxes of $1.87 million) and elected to recognize the regulatory capital impact of its adoption over the three year period.
Prompt Corrective Action.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") establishes a new regulatory scheme, which ties the level of supervisory intervention by bank regulatory authorities primarily to a depository institution's capital category. Among other things, FDICIA authorizes regulatory authorities to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  FDICIA establishes five capital tiers:  well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Basel III Capital Rules, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
A bank will be (i) “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.”
Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, a qualifying community banking organization may elect to use the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework to eliminate the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios. A qualifying community organization is a depository institution or its holding company that has less than $10 billion in average total consolidated assets; has off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets; has trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets; and is not an advanced approaches banking organization. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9% are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and are considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of Section 38 of the FDICIA. Temporary relief was provided to community banks under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act to set the community bank leverage ratio at 8% beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and for the remainder of 2020, to 8.5% effective January 1, 2021 and 9% effective January 1, 2022. A qualifying community banking organization may opt into and out of the CBLR framework by completing the associated reporting requirements on its call report. We presently do not anticipate opting into the CBLR framework. 
Community Reinvestment Act
Financial holding companies and their subsidiary banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”).  Under the CRA, the FRB (or other appropriate bank regulatory agency) is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  Further, such assessment is also required of any financial holding company that has applied to (i) charter a national bank, (ii) obtain deposit insurance coverage for a newly chartered institution, (iii) establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, (iv) relocate an office, or (v) merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally-regulated financial institution.  In the case of a financial holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other financial holding company, the FRB will assess the record of each subsidiary of the applicant financial holding company and such records may be the basis for denying the application or imposing conditions in connection with approval of the application.  
In the most recent CRA examination by the bank regulatory authorities, Summit Community was given a “satisfactory” CRA rating.
In January 2020, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) jointly proposed rules that would significantly change existing CRA regulations. The proposed rules are intended to increase bank activity in low- and moderate-income communities where there is significant need for credit, more responsible lending, greater access to banking services, and improvements to critical infrastructure. The proposals change four key areas: (i) clarifying what activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updating where activities count for CRA credit; (iii) providing a more transparent and objective method for measuring CRA performance; and (iv) revising CRA-related data collection, record keeping, and reporting. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA and their impact to our financial condition, results of operations, and/or liquidity. Although the proposed rules were issued jointly, the FDIC did not join with the OCC when it issued a final rule effective October 1, 2020, revising the existing CRA regulations. As a non-member state bank regulated by the FDIC, Summit Community will not be subject to the revised CRA regulations promulgated by the OCC. 
Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
The enactment of the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”) represents a pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry.  The GLB Act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the Depression Era of the 1930s.  New opportunities were available for banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies and securities firms to enter into combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services.  The GLB Act provides a new regulatory framework through the financial holding company, which has as its “umbrella regulator” the FRB.  Functional regulation of the financial holding company’s separately regulated subsidiaries is conducted by their primary functional regulators.  The GLB Act makes a CRA rating of satisfactory or above necessary for insured depository institutions and their financial holding companies to engage in new financial activities.  The GLB Act specifically gives the FRB the authority, by regulation or order, to expand the list of “financial” or “incidental” activities, but requires consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, and gives the FRB authority to allow a financial holding company to engage in any activity that is “complementary” to a financial activity and does not “pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.”

Under the GLB Act, all financial institutions are required to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic customer data with nonaffiliated parties at the customer’s request and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access.  We have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the GLB Act. Pursuant to Title V of the GLB Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are required to:
•provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices,
•inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties and
•give our customers an option to prevent certain disclosure of such information to non-affiliated third parties.
Deposit Acquisition Limitation
Under West Virginia banking law, an acquisition or merger is not permitted if the resulting depository institution or its holding company, including its affiliated depository institutions, would assume additional deposits to cause it to control deposits in the State of West Virginia in excess of twenty five percent (25%) of such total amount of all deposits held by insured depository institutions in West Virginia.  This limitation may be waived by the Commissioner of Banking by showing good cause.
Consumer Laws and Regulations
In addition to the banking laws and regulations discussed above, bank subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks.  Among the more prominent of such laws and regulations are the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Fair Housing Act.  These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. Bank subsidiaries must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of their ongoing customer relations.
Dodd-Frank centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws.  The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards.  The CFPB’s functions include investigating consumer complaints, rulemaking, supervising and examining banks’ consumer transactions and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and automotive finance.  Summit Community Bank, as a bank with less than $10 billion in assets, is subject to these federal consumer financial laws, but continues to be examined for compliance by the FDIC, its primary federal banking regulator.

The CFPB has issued final regulations implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that require all creditors to determine a consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan before making a loan.  The final rule, referred to as the Ability-to Repay (ATR)/Qualified Mortgage (QM) standards, provide that a lender making a special type of loan, known as a Qualified Mortgage, is entitled to presume that the loan complies with the ATR safe harbor requirements.  The rule establishes different types of Qualified Mortgages that are generally identified as loans with restrictions on loan features, limits on fees being charged and underwriting requirements.
 USA Patriot Act of 2001
The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing.  The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes.  Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. Summit expects to continue to devote significant resources to its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering program, particularly as risks persistently emerge and evolve and as regulatory expectations escalate.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOA”) addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  SOA requires our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each to certify that Summit’s Quarterly and Annual Reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules have several requirements, including requiring these officers certify that:  they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal controls; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal controls; and they have included information in Summit’s Quarterly and Annual Reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation.
Furthermore, in response to the directives of the SOA, NASDAQ adopted substantially expanded corporate governance criteria for the issuers of securities quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market (the market on which our common stock is listed for trading).  The NASDAQ rules govern, among other things, the enhancement and regulation of corporate disclosure and internal governance of listed companies and of the authority, role and responsibilities of their boards of directors and, in particular, of “independent” members of such boards of directors, in the areas of nominations, corporate governance, compensation and the monitoring of the audit and internal financial control processes.
Cybersecurity
In 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. 
Transactions with Affiliates
Federal law restricts subsidiary banks of a financial holding company from making certain extensions of credit to the parent financial holding company or to any of its subsidiaries; from investing in the holding company stock; and limits the ability of a 
subsidiary bank to take its parent company stock as collateral for the loans of any borrower. Additionally, federal law prohibits a financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in conjunction with the extension of credit or furnishing of services.

There are various statutory and regulatory limitations, including those set forth in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the related Federal Reserve Regulation W, governing the extent to which the bank will be able to purchase assets from or securities of or otherwise finance or transfer funds to us or our non-banking affiliates.  Among other restrictions, such transactions between the bank and any one affiliate (including Summit) generally will be limited to ten percent (10%) of the bank’s capital and surplus and transactions between the bank and all affiliates will be limited to twenty percent (20%) of the bank’s capital and surplus.  Furthermore, loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts and are required to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

In addition, any transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provisions of services to an affiliate generally must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies.

Incentive Compensation
The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Summit, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop. 
The federal bank regulatory agencies issued joint guidance in 2010 on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. In addition, Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to issue regulations or guidelines requiring covered financial institutions, including the Company and Summit Community, to prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. A proposed rule was issued in 2016, but this proposed rule has not been finalized. Also, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2015, the SEC proposed rules that would direct stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and would also require companies to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies. The Company continues to evaluate the proposed rules, both of which are subject to further rulemaking procedures.
The CARES Act and Initiatives Related to COVID-19
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide national emergency economic relief measures. Many of the CARES Act’s programs are dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions, such as Summit and Summit Community, and have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over Summit and Summit Community. Furthermore, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic evolves, federal regulatory authorities continue to issue additional guidance with respect to the various CARES Act programs. Congress may enact supplementary COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act. The Company continues to assess the impact of the CARES Act and other statutes, regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Paycheck Protection Program. Section 1102 of the CARES Act created the PPP, a program administered by the SBA to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Summit Community has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the President Trump signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the “Consolidated Appropriations Act” that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the “HHSB Act”). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. First time borrowers and borrowers eligible to obtain a second PPP loan may apply for such loans from January 11, 2021 through March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, Summit Community Bank had funded $101.3 in PPP loans. Those loans have an outstanding balance of $76.7 million as of December 31, 2020.
Loan Forbearance and Deferrals; Foreclosures. Section 4022 of the CARES Act allows, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date the national emergency declared by the President terminates, borrowers with federally-backed one-to-four family mortgage loans experiencing a financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic to request forbearance, regardless of delinquency status, for up to 360 days. Section 4022 also prohibited servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating foreclosures during the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020. Further, on August 27, 2020, the FHFA announced that FNMA and FHLMC would extend their single-family moratorium on foreclosures and evictions through December 31, 2020. In addition, President Biden requested that the federal agencies discussed above continue to extend the moratorium on foreclosures on federally-guaranteed mortgages until at least March 31, 2021. Additionally, under Section 4023 of the CARES Act, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 and the date the national emergency declared by the President terminates, borrowers with federally-backed multifamily mortgage loans whose payments were current as of February 1, 2020, but who have since experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19, may request a forbearance for up to 90 days. Borrowers receiving such forbearance may not evict or charge late fees to tenants for its duration. On December 23, 2020, the FHFA announced an extension of forbearance programs for qualifying multifamily properties through March 31, 2021. These regulatory and legislative actions may be expanded, extended and amended as the pandemic and its economic impact continue.
The bank regulatory agencies ensure that adequate flexibility will be given to financial institutions who work with borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and indicate that they will not criticize institutions who do so in a safe and sound manner. Further, the bank regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to report accurate information to credit bureaus regarding relief provided to borrowers and have urged the importance of financial institutions to continue assisting those borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, on April 3, 2020, the bank regulatory agencies issued a joint policy statement to facilitate mortgage servicers’ ability to place consumers in short-term payment forbearance programs. This policy statement was followed by a final rule, on June 23, 2020, that makes it easier for consumers to transition out of financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rule makes it clear that servicers do not violate Regulation X (which places restrictions and requirements upon lenders, mortgage brokers, or servicers of home loans related to consumers when they apply and receive mortgage loans) by offering certain COVID-19-related loss mitigation options based on an evaluation of limited application information collected from the borrower. Also, in an attempt to allow individuals and businesses to more quickly access real estate equity, on September 29, 2020, the bank regulatory agencies issued a rule that deferred appraisal and evaluation requirements after the closing of certain residential and CRE transactions through December 31, 2020. On January 20, 2021, upon the inauguration of President Biden, the new Administration issued an Executive Order extending the federal eviction moratorium issued through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--which was recently extended by Congress through January 31, 2021--through March 31, 2021. As part of the COVID-19 relief package proposed by the Administration, this eviction moratorium would be further extended through September 30, 2021 if adopted as proposed.
Anti-Money Laundering
The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”), which amends the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (“BSA”), was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations and instituting BSA whistleblower incentives and protections.
Competition
We engage in highly competitive activities. Each activity and market served involves competition with other banks and savings institutions, as well as with non-banking and non-financial enterprises that offer financial products and services that compete directly with our products and services. We actively compete with other banks, mortgage companies and other financial service companies in our efforts to obtain deposits and make loans, in the scope and types of services offered, in interest rates paid on time deposits and charged on loans and in other aspects of banking.

Of particular note, banking laws limit the total amount we can lend to any one borrower generally to 15 percent of Summit Community’s Tier 1 capital plus its allowance for credit losses.  Summit Community evaluated the risks and rewards of lending up to this legal lending limit and established a self-imposed lending limit equal to 85 percent of its legal lending limit. Accordingly, institutions larger than Summit Community have a natural competitive advantage to serve the loan needs of larger clients as their legal lending limits are proportionally greater than ours.
In addition to competing with other banks and mortgage companies, we compete with other financial institutions engaged in the business of making loans or accepting deposits, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, industrial loan associations, insurance companies, small loan companies, finance companies, real estate investment trusts, certain governmental agencies, credit card organizations and other enterprises.  In addition, competition for money market accounts 
from securities brokers has also intensified. Additional competition for deposits comes from government and private issues of debt obligations and other investment alternatives for depositors, such as money market funds.  We take an aggressive competitive posture and intend to continue vigorously competing for market share within our service areas by offering competitive rates and terms on both loans and deposits.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, we employed 415 full-time equivalent team members. We have acquired five banks over the last five years resulting in an overall increase of approximately 187 full-time employees. The average tenure of our full-time employees, including time employed by the banks we acquired is 10.47 years, while the average tenure of our executive management team is approximately 23.5 years. We have 6 employees that have been with the Company more than 40 years; 80 employees that have been with the Company more than 20 years and 264 employees that have been with the Company more than 5 years. 
Summit's service commitment to customers is a fundamental value of our company, and is embodied in our ‘Service Beyond Expectations’ culture. We recognize the critical role our employees play in implementing our ‘Service Beyond Expectations’ core strategy. The dedication of our employees resulted in Summit Community’s recognition as the number-one “Best-In-State-Bank” in West Virginia by Forbes in 2018. This award was based on a survey of more than 25,000 customers in the United States for their opinions on their current and former banking relationships.
While our employees are focused on providing ‘Service Beyond Expectations’ to our customers and to the community, Summit’s Board of Directors and management team are focused on providing a workplace where employees feel valued and respected, are supported professionally and personally through on the job training, development programs and health and wellness programs, and are recognized and rewarded based on their individual results and performance and the performance of the Company.
Summit values diversity in our employees, customers, suppliers, marketplace, and community. We believe employing a diverse workforce that is reflective of our customers and the communities that we serve helps us to better identify and deliver ‘Service Beyond Expectations’ to meet our customers’ and communities’ particular financial needs. We are committed to attracting, retaining and promoting our employees regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, national origin, age, relation and physical ability. We identify and hire the best candidates for all open positions based on qualifying factors for the position and free from discrimination. 
Management reviews and monitors our workforce data provided to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to ensure that we are recruiting, promoting and retaining diverse employees. We dedicate resources to promote a safe and inclusive workplace. Our employees participate in various training courses including a course on sexual harassment and a course on accepting each other’s differences. We believe that our diverse workforce is representative of our customers and communities and we will continue to support and promote diversity.
Summit is committed to employee development and retention. We provide professional development opportunities, on the job training and mentoring to all of our employees. We encourage our employees to pursue educational opportunities that will help improve their job skills and performance. Our employees attend training, development and compliance courses offered by the West Virginia Bankers Association, the Community Bankers of West Virginia and the Virginia Bankers Association, and financial and credit risk management courses offered by The Risk Management Association. We also support employees who desire to continue their education in areas that are directly related to their jobs. We reimburse fees for continuing education courses and for certain certifications. We also provide up to $500 per employee in educational assistance annually for those employees who wish to continue their education. 
Our compensation and benefits package is designed to attract, motivate and retain employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, the Company provides a variety of short-term, long-term and commission-based incentive compensation programs to reward performance relative to key financial performance of the Company and customer experience metrics. The Company’s long-term compensation program is directly linked to the long-term performance of the Company, its common stock and Summit Community. Summit offers comprehensive health and benefit options to its employees consisting of health, dental, vision, life insurance, disability insurance, paid vacation, paid illness, and holidays. Summit also maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) which covers substantially all employees. Under the provisions of the ESOP, employee participants in the ESOP are not permitted to contribute to the ESOP, rather the cost of the ESOP is borne by the Company through annual contributions in amounts determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. Discretionary contributions were made by the Company for 2020 of 5%. As of December 31, 2020, the ESOP owned 4.0% of the Company’s common stock. In addition, the Company has a defined contribution plan with 401(k) provisions covering substantially all employees. Under the provisions of the plan, the Company matches 100% of the participant’s salary reduction contributions, up to 4% of such participant’s compensation. The Company may also make optional contributions at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. 
We are committed and focused on the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges to maintain employee and customer safety while continuing to be open for business. In response to this unprecedented crisis, we implemented various plans, strategies and protocols to protect our employees, maintain services for customers, assure the functional continuity of our operating systems, controls and processes, and mitigate the financial risks posed by changing market conditions. In order to protect employees and assure workforce continuity and operational redundancy, we imposed business travel restrictions, enhanced our sanitizing protocols within our facilities and physically separated, to the extent possible, our critical operations workforce. 
Summit employees actively share their talents in their communities through volunteer activities in education, economic development, human and health services, and community reinvestment. Bank management and personnel serve in leadership positions on several community development organizations that provide affordable housing assistance, economic development, and community services for low- and moderate-income individuals and families. In addition, Summit Community offers a Bank at School program, which encourages students to save and informs them of the banking system. As of December 30, 2020, the bank had 64 accounts in this program. Even during a pandemic, Summit employees found creative ways to give back to their communities by donating and delivering food to organizations selected by each branch location, collecting and donating food to local food banks/pantries, delivering hand sanitizer to various organizations and handing out gloves and masks at branches to customers.
