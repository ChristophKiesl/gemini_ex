Item 1. Business.
Overview
Novan, Inc. is a medical dermatology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutic products for skin diseases. Our goal is to deliver safe and efficacious therapies to patients, including developing product candidates where there are unmet medical needs. We are developing SB206 (berdazimer gel, 10.3%) as a topical prescription gel for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum. In the first quarter of 2022, we completed the EPI Health Acquisition. EPI Health equips us with a commercial infrastructure across sales, marketing, and communications, as well as a dedicated market access and pharmacy relations team, and positions us as a fully integrated dermatology company with a pipeline of development candidates focused primarily on dermatological indications supported by a commercial platform to market and sell therapeutic products for skin diseases. 
Following the acquisition, we employ approximately 90 staff, including sales personnel currently covering 42 territories. Through our acquisition of EPI Health, we promote products for plaque psoriasis, rosacea and acne. We also have a pipeline of potential product candidates using our proprietary nitric oxide-based technology platform, Nitricil, to generate new treatments for multiple indications.
We will continue to need additional funding to support our planned and future operating activities and make further advancements in our product development programs beyond what is currently included in our operating forecast and related cash projection. We do not currently have sufficient funds to complete commercialization of any of our product candidates that are under development, and our funding needs will largely be determined by our commercialization strategy for SB206 (berdazimer gel, 10.3%), subject to the regulatory approval process and outcome. We are pursuing a broad range of financing options that could be used to extend our cash runway, including, among other things, to further prepare for commercialization of SB206 following approval.
Further advancement of our molluscum program, including through the NDA process and potential commercialization of SB206, or advancement of any other early-stage or late-stage clinical program across our platform, is subject to our ability to secure additional capital. Sources of additional capital may potentially include (i) debt or equity financings, such as through sales of common stock, or (ii) other sources, such as partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships. Any issuance of equity, or debt convertible into equity, would result in further significant dilution to our existing stockholders.
In addition to the regulatory progression of SB206, including implementing prelaunch strategy and commercial preparation, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering, we may progress (a) SB204, a topical monotherapy for the treatment of acne, by commencing a pivotal Phase 3 study, or (b) SB019, as a potential intranasal treatment option for respiratory infections. 
Please refer to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report for further discussion regarding our current liquidity and our future funding needs in addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.
Recent Highlights 
•In March 2023, we announced that the FDA completed its filing review of our NDA submitted in early January seeking marketing approval for berdazimer gel, 10.3% (SB206) for the topical treatment of molluscum. The FDA determined our application was sufficiently complete, no filing review issues were identified, the substantive review process had commenced, and we were assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of January 5, 2024. 
2022 Highlights 
•For the year ended December 31, 2022, we demonstrated growth in total prescriptions for our actively marketed portfolio:
–Rhofade (oxymetazoline hydrochloride) - 33% annual growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 with 156,664 total prescriptions.
–Wynzora (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) - 41,023 total prescriptions for the year ended December 31, 2022, following launch of the product in the third quarter of 2021.
–Minolira (minocycline hydrochloride) - 61% annual growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 with 40,641 total prescriptions.
•In late December 2022, we announced that we had entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sato Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Sato, granting Sato the right to develop, manufacture and market Rhofade (oxymetazoline hydrochloride 1% cream) for rosacea in the Japan territory. Under the exclusive license agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million in January 2023 and are entitled to receive a $2.5 million milestone payment at the time of marketing approval in Japan and royalty payments on net sales of the product in Japan. Sato will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval 
in Japan and will have the right to use EPI Health’s U.S. dossier for Rhofade. Sato will also have a right of first negotiation related to Rhofade in certain other countries in the Asia Pacific region. A portion of the amounts of the upfront and milestone payments are payable by us to a third party under contractual obligations related to Rhofade.
•In early December 2022, we announced that we entered into an accounts receivable-backed factoring agreement with Bay View Funding, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heritage Bank of Commerce. The new $15.0 million factoring facility provides working capital in an amount that is up to 70% of EPI Health’s gross eligible receivables.
•In July 2022, we announced the publication of positive efficacy and safety data from our completed B-SIMPLE 4 pivotal Phase 3 clinical study evaluating berdazimer gel, 10.3% for the treatment of molluscum in the peer-reviewed journal, JAMA Dermatology. Berdazimer gel, 10.3%, Novan’s potential first-in-class topical nitric oxide-based prescription treatment, demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety with low adverse event rates.
•In June 2022, we announced the closing of a $15.0 million registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules with an institutional investor. 
•In March 2022, we announced the acquisition of EPI Health, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the U.S. dermatology market. The acquisition provided the commercial infrastructure for Novan to become a fully-integrated specialty dermatology company with a solid pipeline of development candidates complemented by a commercial foundation. In July 2022, we announced that we had reached agreement with Evening Post Group, LLC, or EPG, regarding payment, satisfaction and termination of our $16.5 million secured promissory note and security agreement associated with the EPI Health Acquisition. Novan and EPG agreed that, upon EPG’s receipt of $10.0 million, which Novan subsequently paid, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations of Novan under the promissory note were fully satisfied, and accordingly, the promissory note and related security agreements were terminated.
Commercial Portfolio
Our commercial portfolio includes six branded prescription drugs that we acquired in the EPI Health Acquisition. We actively promote three medical dermatological products in the United States and derive revenue from the sale of these branded products through pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as direct to pharmacies. These prescription dermatology therapies are targeted to patients with plaque psoriasis, rosacea, and acne. The branded and promoted product portfolio currently includes Wynzora, Rhofade, and Minolira.
The following summarizes our complete commercial product portfolio:
Wynzora Cream (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate cream), or Wynzora, is a combination of calcipotriene, a vitamin D analog, and betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, indicated for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients 18 years of age or older. EPI Health entered into a collaboration agreement with MC2 Therapeutics, or MC2, in August 2020, as amended effective January 1, 2022, for the commercialization of Wynzora in the United States, or the MC2 Agreement. Under the MC2 Agreement, MC2 retains full ownership of Wynzora. In particular, we use our commercial infrastructure to promote and sell Wynzora in return for retaining a share of net sales of Wynzora in the United States. The portion of net sales we retain varies depending on the aggregate annual net sales of the product, and ranges from a percentage in the mid-teens to a mid-single digit percentage as net sales reach certain thresholds. Additionally, MC2 also pays for certain incremental costs incurred by us in commercialization activities according to a budget to be agreed annually between the parties. The term of the MC2 Agreement expires in June 2028, unless earlier terminated by either party under certain conditions.
Rhofade (oxymetazoline hydrochloride cream, 1%), or Rhofade, is an alpha1A adrenoceptor agonist indicated for the topical treatment of persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults. EPI Health acquired the rights to Rhofade in October 2019. In connection with that acquisition and other historical acquisitions related to Rhofade, we are required to make certain milestone payments based on future net sales of Rhofade along with paying a combined royalty on net sales of Rhofade and related products initially in the low double digits, which rate may increase based on the thresholds of net sales we achieve.
Minolira (biphasic minocycline hydrochloride immediate release/extended release 105 mg and 135 mg tablets), or Minolira, is indicated to treat inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older. EPI Health acquired the rights to Minolira in the United States in August 2018, and we are required to pay certain milestones based on future sales of Minolira.
Cloderm (clocortoline pivalate cream 0.1%), or Cloderm, is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. EPI Health acquired the rights to Cloderm in September 2018. In connection with that acquisition, EPI Health is required to pay minimum royalty payments on net sales of Cloderm, subject to meeting certain net sales milestones.
Sitavig (acyclovir 50mg buccal tablets), or Sitavig, is indicated for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores) in immunocompetent adults. We are party to a license agreement EPI Health entered into with Vectans Pharma, or Vectans, for the rights to commercialize Sitavig in the United States and Canada. 
Nuvail (poly-ureaurethane 16% nail solution), or Nuvail, is indicated for managing signs and symptoms of nail dystrophy, i.e. nail splitting or nail fragility, for intact or damaged nails. We are party to a license agreement EPI Health entered into for the sale of Nuvail and serve as an exclusive distributor of this product in the United States.
Research and Development Portfolio
Our proprietary technology platform leverages nitric oxide’s naturally occurring anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action to treat a range of diseases with significant unmet needs. Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a platform with the potential to generate differentiated product candidates. The two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of macromolecular NCEs and our formulation science, both of which we use to tune our product candidates for specific indications. Our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form, on demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of diseases.
We have clinical-stage dermatology and anti-infective drug candidates with multi-factorial (SB204), anti-viral (SB206), anti-fungal (SB208), and anti-inflammatory (SB414) mechanisms of action. We have also introduced a possible anti-viral product candidate for the treatment of external genital warts (SB207). We have conducted or are currently conducting preclinical work on NCEs, including berdazimer sodium, and formulations for the potential treatment of (i) respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (SB019), (ii) antimicrobial indications for the adjacent companion animal health market (NVN4100), (iii) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia caused by high-risk human papilloma virus, or HPV, in the men’s and women’s health field (WH504 and WH602), and (iv) inflammatory disorders.
Our primary programmatic focus is on our molluscum product candidate, SB206, and we intend to continue to focus our near term development efforts on this program.
Priority Development Pipeline
We are currently focusing our efforts on our Priority Development Pipeline. We presently maintain exclusive, worldwide commercial rights for all product candidates currently in our pipeline, with the exception of the rights we have licensed to Sato to develop, use and sell SB204 and SB206 in Japan. 
SB206, a Topical Anti-viral Treatment for Molluscum Contagiosum (a Viral Skin Infection)
We are developing SB206 (12% berdazimer sodium, 10.3% berdazimer) as a topical gel with anti-viral properties for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum is a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus that affects up to six million people in the United States annually. The greatest incidence is in children aged one to 14 years. The average time to resolution is 13 months; however, 13% of children experience lesions that may not resolve in 24 months. There is no FDA-approved prescription drug treatment for molluscum. More than half of patients diagnosed with the infection are untreated. The majority of patients in the United States that receive treatment are treated with potentially painful procedures and the remaining are often prescribed products indicated for the treatment of external genital warts.
Following positive results of our phase 3 B-SIMPLE4 trial for SB206, in April 2022, we held a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA, and subsequently received written minutes related to this interaction. Based on the information provided and our consideration thereof, in early January 2023 we submitted an NDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for berdazimer gel, 10.3% (SB206). In March 2023, we announced that the FDA completed its filing review of our NDA seeking marketing approval for berdazimer gel, 10.3% (SB206). The FDA determined our application was sufficiently complete, no filing review issues were identified, the substantive review process had commenced, and we were assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of January 5, 2024.
SB204, for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris
SB204 is a product candidate designed as a once-daily, topical monotherapy for the treatment of acne vulgaris, a multi-factorial disease with multiple aspects of the disease pathology (immunomodulatory and anti-bacterial). Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the United States. The disease ranges in severity from mild to severe cystic acne and causes both physical and psychological effects, including permanent scarring, anxiety, depression and poor self-esteem. Acne is a multi-factorial disease with several mechanistic contributors to the disease pathology, often requiring multiple treatments that address more than one of the major causes of acne pathogenesis. Localized nitric oxide delivery may provide immunomodulatory (anti-inflammatory) and anti-bacterial mechanisms of action from a single active ingredient. We believe that acne continues to be characterized as an unmet medical need due to the difficulty of balancing efficacy, systemic safety and cutaneous tolerability, as well as the growing concerns with anti-bacterial resistance with existing therapies. In our SB204 clinical development program, topical application of SB204 has been well-tolerated with no significant safety concerns identified. In maximal-use pharmacokinetic trials that we have conducted in adult and pediatric patients with acne vulgaris, we observed no detectable systemic exposure from SB204 following its topical application.
Based on the positive pivotal Phase 3 results in the SB206 molluscum development program, we believe we can optimize the trial design of a pivotal Phase 3 study for SB204 that has the potential to serve as a second pivotal trial to support an NDA submission. As such, our intention is to progress SB204 by commencing a pivotal Phase 3 study, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
Sato Agreement
In January 2017, we licensed rights to Sato to develop, use, and sell SB204 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of acne vulgaris, and to manufacture the finished form of SB204 for sale in Japan. In 2018, we licensed rights to Sato to develop, use, and sell SB206 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of viral skin infections, and to manufacture the finished form of SB206 for sale in Japan. The significant terms and the related accounting considerations of our licensing arrangement with Sato are further described in Note 14—“License and Collaboration Revenues” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Pipeline Expansion Opportunities
Our pipeline expansion opportunities are as follows:
SB019, an Intranasal Treatment Option for COVID-19 or Other Respiratory Infections 
We previously explored the use of our proprietary Nitricil technology to progress SB019, a potential intranasal treatment option for COVID-19 or other respiratory infections, targeting the reduction of viral shedding and transmission. Nitric oxide has generally demonstrated the ability to inhibit viral replication of viruses within the Coronaviridae family, and we have an extensive body of in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating the efficacy of our proprietary technology for other anti-viral indications. Based on the scientific literature and data available to-date related to berdazimer sodium and SB206, we believe that nitric oxide may inhibit viral replication by disrupting protein function critical for viral replication and infection through generation of reactive intermediates.
Based on the positive preclinical and clinical data demonstrating anti-viral effect of berdazimer sodium against multiple viruses, as well as the public health need to reduce breakthrough infections and transmission of COVID-19 and on our interactions with the FDA, we believe there may be an opportunity to expand beyond our preclinical work for the SB019 product candidate. However, the SB019 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
SB414, for the Treatment of Inflammatory Skin Diseases, including Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis
SB414 is a product candidate designed as a topical cream for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, with a focus on the treatment of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
SB208, for the Treatment of Athlete’s Foot (Tinea Pedis) and Fungal Nail Infections (Onychomycosis)
SB208 is a product candidate designed as a topical broad-spectrum anti-fungal gel for the potential treatment of fungal infections of the skin and nails, including athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) and fungal nail infections (onychomycosis). The SB208 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
SB207, for the Treatment of External Genital Warts
Genital warts are among the world’s most common sexually transmitted diseases. We have previously evaluated SB206’s anti-viral activity against genital warts caused by HPV. In response to our identification of targeted viral opportunities of high unmet need where we believe our nitric oxide releasing technology could provide clinical benefit to patients, we developed SB207, a new anti-viral product candidate for the treatment of external genital warts. Further advancement of SB207 is subject to further evaluation of clinical plans and developmental timelines, as well as obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
Advancement in Men’s and Women’s Health
We have been awarded federal grants of approximately $1.3 million from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and approximately $1.1 million from the U.S. Department of Defense’s, or DoD, Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, or CDMRP. These grants have enabled the conduct of IND-enabling toxicology and pharmacology studies and other preclinical activity of a nitric oxide containing intravaginal gel (WH602) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, or CIN, and a non-gel formulation product candidate (WH504). Under the terms of these grants, we are entitled to receive the grant funds in the form of periodic reimbursements of our allowable direct expenses, allocated overhead, general and administrative expenses and payment of other specified amounts.
Companion Animal Health
We have initiated exploratory work to evaluate our new chemical entity, NVN4100, as a potential product candidate for antimicrobial indications in companion animal health. This program is currently on hold, pending the engagement of potential collaborators or strategic partners to progress this asset, including the conduct of additional studies and formulation work.
Our Customers
We primarily sell our medical dermatology prescription products direct to pharmacies and to national wholesaler channels. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains, independent pharmacies and others. As of December 31, 2022, three of our wholesaler customers accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance at 25%, 13% and 12%, respectively. 
Seasonality of Business
Our business is affected by the standard annual insurance deductible resets, as well as the purchasing patterns and concentration of our customers. In addition, certain dermatological conditions, such as acne, may be impacted by the warmer months and prescriptions may also be impacted based on the activities of those who are prescribed our products, such as school and summer activities; however, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. There are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We consider our primary potential competition to be a broad base of existing providers and drug developers of therapeutics in the field of dermatology. Product competition includes pharmaceutical generics, branded generics, pharmaceutical brands, biologics as well as over-the-counter, or OTC, products. 
We expect continued future competition across research and drug development in various different fields of innovation; capital and resource allocation to many of these areas appears to be continuous and of a global nature. In addition, there are certain instances where competition extends into the medical procedure and the medical device spectrums of human health care. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with these existing therapies as well as new therapies that may become available in the future. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products and therapies.
Pharmaceutical Industry
Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater numbers of personnel in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
Dermatology Sector
The dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of midsize and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC sector. Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology. Competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which our products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts.
Branded products often must compete with therapeutically similar branded or generic products or with generic equivalents. Such competition frequently increases over time. For example, if competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products could be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales. To successfully compete for business, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Accordingly, we face pressure to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively.
Our major competitors, including Galderma Laboratories, Dermavant, Sol-Gel Technologies, Almirall, Verrica Pharmaceuticals, Journey Medical Corporation, Sun Pharma, Leo Pharma, Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Mayne Pharma, and Ortho Dermatologics, among others, vary depending on therapeutic and product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems, among other factors.
Generic Competition
We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to the FDA seeking to market generic versions of our products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, 
and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Generic products generally face intense competition from other generic equivalents (including authorized generics) and therapeutically similar branded or generic products.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and technologies and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluating and taking appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and its foreign counterparts. We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and confidentiality policies and procedures, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
We own or have a license to issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions (including applications filed in foreign jurisdictions and international or Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that have not yet entered national phase). Patent coverage lasts for varying periods according to the date of filing of the patent application or the date of grant or issuance of the patent and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the USPTO delay in issuing the patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a patent may also be eligible for patent term extension to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the extension term cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Four of our marketed products, Rhofade, Minolira, Wynzora, and Sitavig, currently have one or more patents listed in the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Orange Book, or the Orange Book.

Trade Secrets
We rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information by limiting access to such information on a need-to-know basis exclusively. In addition, we seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, or to include such provisions in their consulting agreement, upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements and provisions, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Trademarks

On April 29, 2019, we entered into a royalty and milestone payments purchase agreement with Reedy Creek Investments LLC, or Reedy Creek, pursuant to which Reedy Creek provided us funding in an initial amount of $25.0 million, for us to use primarily to 
pursue the development, regulatory approval and potential commercialization activities for SB206, for the treatment of molluscum, and advance programmatically other activities with respect to SB414, for atopic dermatitis, and SB204, for acne.
On May 4, 2019, we entered into a development funding and royalties agreement, or the Funding Agreement, with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand, pursuant to which Ligand provided us funding of $12.0 million, which we used to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206, for the treatment of molluscum.
Please see Note 15—“Research and Development Agreements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding these research and development arrangements, including our obligations under these agreements.
Collaboration and Licensing Agreements
Wynzora Agreement
Effective as of January 1, 2022, EPI Health entered into the MC2 Agreement relating to the commercialization of Wynzora for treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults in the United States. Pursuant to the MC2 Agreement, which sets forth the collaborative efforts between EPI Health and MC2 to commercialize and promote Wynzora with MC2 in the United States, MC2 granted EPI Health an exclusive right and license under MC2’s intellectual property rights to sell, or detail (as defined in the MC2 Agreement), and engage in certain commercialization activities with respect to Wynzora in the United States.
In exchange for the provision of promotional and commercialization activities, under the terms of the MC2 Agreement, we are entitled to receive: 
•Reimbursement for all incremental costs incurred by us for the promotion and commercialization of Wynzora, including the incremental portion of our personnel and commercial operating costs. The supply price of Wynzora product inventory is also considered to be an incremental cost that is reimbursed by MC2.
•A commercialization fee equivalent to a percentage of net sales ranging from the mid-teens for net sales less than or equal to $65.0 million to the upper single digits for annual net sales greater than $105.0 million. We collect this commercialization fee by retaining our portion of the Wynzora product net sales we collect from our customers, with the remainder of the net sales being remitted by us to MC2 periodically in the form of a royalty payment, pursuant to the MC2 Agreement. 
•A contingent incentive fee equal to 5% of the first $30.0 million in net sales of Wynzora sold in the United States by EPI Health in each of the 2022 and 2023 calendar years; provided that such incentive fee shall not exceed $1.5 million each year and such incentive fee shall not be credited to us until the royalty payments paid to MC2 surpass the amount of certain commercialization payments made previously by MC2. 
The term of the MC2 Agreement runs until the seventh anniversary of the first commercial sale of Wynzora (as defined in the MC2 Agreement) or June 30, 2028, whichever is earlier. Either party may terminate the MC2 Agreement for the other party’s material uncured breach or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. MC2 may terminate the MC2 Agreement under certain scenarios, including for convenience with twelve months’ advance notice to us, provided that the termination is not effective unless MC2 pays any unpaid historical liabilities related to commercialization of Wynzora owed by MC2. In the case of such termination, MC2 is also required to make an additional sunset payment to us, paid in installments over the 24 month period following termination. We may terminate the MC2 Agreement for convenience with twelve months’ advance notice to MC2 provided that the termination is not effective unless we provide MC2 with a guarantee of the payment of any outstanding royalty payments, to the extent such royalty payments owed by us exceeds any unpaid historical liabilities related to commercialization of Wynzora owed by MC2.
For additional information about the Wynzora and MC2 Agreement, please refer to Note 13—“Net Product Revenues” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Sato Agreement - SB206 and SB204
On January 12, 2017, we entered into a license agreement, and related first amendment, with Sato, relating to SB204, our drug candidate for the treatment of acne vulgaris in Japan, or the Sato Agreement. Pursuant to the Sato Agreement, we granted to Sato an exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable right and license under certain of our intellectual property rights, with the right to sublicense with our prior written consent, to develop, use and sell products in Japan that incorporate SB204 in certain topical dosage forms for the treatment of acne vulgaris, and to make the finished form of such products. 
On October 5, 2018, we entered into the second amendment, or the Sato Amendment, to the Sato Agreement, or collectively, the Amended Sato Agreement. The Sato Amendment expanded the Sato Agreement to include SB206, our drug candidate for the treatment of viral skin infections. Pursuant to the Amended Sato Agreement, we granted to Sato an exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable license under certain of our intellectual property rights, with the right to sublicense with our prior written consent, to develop, use and sell products in Japan that incorporate SB204 or SB206 in certain topical dosage forms for the treatment of acne vulgaris or viral skin infections, respectively, and to make the finished form of such products. We or our designated contract manufacturer will supply finished product to Sato for use in the development of SB204 and SB206 in the licensed territory. The rights granted to Sato do not include the right to manufacture the API of SB204 or SB206; rather, we agreed to negotiate a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which we or our designated contract manufacturer would be the exclusive supplier to Sato of the API for the commercial manufacture of licensed products in the licensed territory. Under the terms of the Amended Sato Agreement, we also have exclusive rights to certain intellectual property that may be developed by Sato in the future, which we could choose to use for our own development and commercialization of SB204 or SB206 outside of Japan.
The term of the Amended Sato Agreement (and the period during which Sato must pay royalties under the amended license agreement) expires on the twentieth anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product in the licensed field in the licensed territory (adjusted from the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale in the Sato Agreement). The term of the Amended Sato Agreement may be renewed with respect to a licensed product by mutual written agreement of the parties for additional 2-year periods following expiration of the initial term. All other material terms of the Sato Agreement remain unchanged by the Sato Amendment. 
Sato is responsible for funding the development and commercial costs for the program that are specific to Japan. We are obligated to perform certain oversight, review and supporting activities for Sato, including: (i) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain marketing approval of SB204 and SB206 in the United States; (ii) sharing all future scientific information we may obtain during the term of the Amended Sato Agreement pertaining to SB204 and SB206; (iii) performing certain additional preclinical studies if such studies are deemed necessary by the Japanese regulatory authority, up to and not to exceed a total cost of $1.0 million; and (iv) participating in a joint committee that oversees, reviews and approves Sato’s development and commercialization activities under the Amended Sato Agreement. Additionally, we have granted Sato the option to use our trademarks in connection with the commercialization of licensed products in the licensed territory for no additional consideration, subject to our approval of such use.
The Amended Sato Agreement may be terminated by (i) Sato without cause upon 120 days’ advance written notice to us; (ii) either party in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach upon 60 days’ advance written notice; (iii) force majeure; (iv) either party in the event of the other party’s dissolution, liquidation, bankruptcy or insolvency; and (v) by us immediately upon written notice if Sato challenges the validity, patentability, or enforceability of any of our patents or patent applications licensed to Sato under the Amended Sato Agreement. In the event of a termination, no portion of the upfront fees received from Sato is refundable.
For additional information about the Amended Sato Agreement, please refer to Note 14—“License and Collaboration Revenues” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Sato Rhofade Agreement
In December 2022, we entered into a license agreement with Sato in which Sato was granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable right and license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and market Rhofade for the treatment of rosacea in Japan, or the Sato Rhofade Agreement. In addition, per the Sato Rhofade Agreement, during a specified time period, Sato has an exclusive option to negotiate the terms under which its license would be expanded to include certain other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
In exchange for the license granted to Sato, Sato agreed to pay us the following: (i) an upfront payment of $5.0 million; and (ii) a milestone payment of $2.5 million upon receipt of marketing approval of Rhofade for rosacea in the Japan territory. Sato also agreed to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales of the licensed product ranging over time from a percentage of net sales in the mid-teens to a percentage of net sales in the low single digits. 
In addition, we are required to pay 25% of the upfront and milestone payment amounts to a third party under existing contractual obligations related to Rhofade and will also be required to pay a portion of the royalty amounts received under the Sato Rhofade Agreement to third parties, after which we will retain net royalties in the low single digits. For additional information about the Sato Rhofade Agreement related payment to a third party, please see below.
The initial term of the Sato Rhofade Agreement expires on the fifteenth anniversary of the first marketing approval of the licensed product for rosacea in the Japan territory. The term of the Sato Rhofade Agreement automatically extends for a further period of two years, unless either party gives one year’s notice before the end of the initial term.
The Sato Rhofade Agreement may be terminated, among other reasons, (i) by Sato without cause upon 120 days’ advance written notice to us; (ii) by either party in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach upon 60 days’ advance written notice; and (iii) by us if Sato challenges the validity, patentability or enforceability of any of our patents licensed to Sato under the Sato Rhofade Agreement.
For additional information about the Sato Rhofade Agreement, please refer to Note 14—“License and Collaboration Revenues” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Rhofade Agreements 
In connection with the Rhofade Acquisition Agreement that is described in Note 9—“Commitments and Contingencies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, EPI Health acquired rights to that certain Assignment and License Agreement, and through the Assignment and License Agreement, we license certain intellectual property from Aspect Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Aspect, and such agreement, the Aspect Agreement. Under the terms of the Aspect Agreement, we, through EPI Health, have exclusive rights to, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to, commercialize the Rhofade product. We, through EPI Health, also have a duty to certain other parties to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the Rhofade product based on historical acquisition agreements for Rhofade that were assumed by EPI Health. 
The Aspect Agreement expires upon the last-to-expire of patent claims made under the assigned and licensed patents under the Aspect Agreement. Aspect may terminate the agreement upon a material breach by EPI Health after providing an opportunity to cure. Upon such termination by Aspect, EPI Health will cease all development and commercialization of Rhofade and EPI Health will assign and convey to Aspect its entire right, title and interest in and to the assigned intellectual property transferred under the Aspect Agreement. 
Additionally, under the Aspect Agreement, the Rhofade Acquisition Agreement and the other historical acquisitions related to Rhofade, we are also required to pay a combined royalty on net sales of Rhofade and related products initially in the low double digits, which rate may increase based on the thresholds of net sales we achieve. We are also required to pay 25% of any upfront, license, milestone or other related payments received by EPI Health related to any sublicenses of Rhofade and related products. 
In connection with two abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, settlement agreements that EPI Health entered into in connection with Rhofade in 2021, EPI Health granted two ANDA filers a license to launch their own generic product for the treatment of erythema in rosacea. The actual timing of the launch of such generic products is uncertain because the launch dates of such products under the settlement agreements are subject to acceleration under certain circumstances. In the absence of any circumstances triggering acceleration, the earliest launch of such a generic product would be in the third quarter of 2026.
For additional information about the Rhofade Agreements, please refer to Note 12—“License and Collaboration Agreements” and Note 9—“Commitments and Contingencies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Minolira Agreements 
In connection with the Minolira acquisition that is described in Note 9—“Commitments and Contingencies”, EPI Health assumed the royalty obligation related to an ANDA settlement in connection with Minolira. Accordingly, we, through EPI Health, are required to pay a royalty to an ANDA filer in the low double digits of any generic form of Minolira that is the pharmaceutical equivalent of the 105 mg or 135 mg strength Minolira product.
For additional information about the Minolira Agreements, please refer to Note 12—“License and Collaboration Agreements” and Note 9—“Commitments and Contingencies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
UNC Agreements
We acquired exclusive rights to our library of Nitricil compounds pursuant to license agreements with UNC entered into in July 2007 and October 2009, which were subsequently amended, restated and consolidated in June 2012. We amended the consolidated license agreement in November 2012 to expand the scope of licensed patents to cover additional nitric oxide technologies in consideration for an upfront cash payment. We may obtain similar amendments to the consolidated license agreement to expand the scope of licensed patents to cover future additional nitric oxide technologies or as improvements on licensed technology and, if such amendments were executed, we may be required to pay additional upfront cash payments. In April 2016, November 2018 and November 2021, we amended the agreement to clarify the scope of the intellectual property of the consolidated license agreement and to make modifications to certain milestones under the consolidated license agreement.
Under the consolidated license agreement with UNC, we are granted an exclusive, worldwide license, with the ability to sublicense, under the licensed UNC patents, including those directed to Nitricil compounds, to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology. As partial consideration for the consolidated license agreement, we issued 19,105 shares of our common stock to UNC and a nominal upfront cash payment. Additionally, under the consolidated license agreement, we are obligated to pay UNC a running royalty percentage in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products (by us or any of our sublicensees, such as Sato), and to pay up to $425,000 to UNC in regulatory and commercial milestones on a licensed product by licensed product basis.
Under the consolidated license agreement, UNC controls prosecution activities with respect to licensed patents owned solely by UNC, we control prosecution activities with respect to licensed patents jointly owned by us and UNC and we are obligated to reimburse UNC for reasonable prosecution and maintenance costs. Pursuant to the consolidated license agreement, we have the first 
right to defend against third-party claims of patent infringement with respect to the licensed products and to enforce the licensed patents against third-party infringers.
Unless earlier terminated by us at our election, or if we materially breach the agreement or become bankrupt, the consolidated license agreement remains in effect on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis until the expiration of the last to expire issued patent covering such licensed product in the applicable country, and upon such expiration, we receive a perpetual, unrestricted, fully-paid and royalty free right to develop and commercialize such licensed product in such country. As of December 31, 2022, the last to expire issued patent licensed to us under the consolidated license agreement is projected to expire in 2036. UNC may terminate the agreement or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive for our material breach of the agreement that remains uncured after 90 days of receipt of written notice thereof from UNC and may also terminate the agreement or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive upon providing written notice for our bankruptcy or insolvency-related events within 30 days of the occurrence of such events. We may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience upon providing written notice of not less than 30 days to UNC.
Other Research and Development Agreements
We have entered into various licensing agreements with universities and other research institutions under which we receive the rights, and in some cases substantially all of the rights, of the inventors, assignees or co-assignees to produce and market technology protected by certain patents and patent applications. In addition to the UNC License Agreement, which is our primary license agreement, the counterparties to our various other licensing agreements are the University of Akron Research Foundation, Hospital for Special Surgery, Strakan International S.a.r.l., which is a licensee of the University of Aberdeen, KIPAX AB and KNOW Bio. 
We are required to make payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and will be required to make royalty payments based on a percentage of future sales of covered products or a percentage of sublicensing revenue. As future royalty payments are directly related to future revenues (either sales or sublicensing), future commitments cannot be determined. No accrual for future payments under these agreements has been recorded, as we cannot estimate if, when or in what amount payments may become due.
Separation Transaction and Licensing Arrangements with KNOW Bio, including Amendments
2015 Separation Transaction and Licensing Arrangements
In connection with the December 2015 separation of our non-dermatology assets to KNOW Bio, we granted to KNOW Bio, through two separate agreements, exclusive licenses, with the right to sublicense, to certain United States and foreign patents and patent applications controlled by us as of the execution date of the agreement, and, under one of the agreements, patents and patent applications which became controlled by us during the three years immediately following the execution date of such agreement, directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics.
Under the exclusive licenses, the following rights were retained by Novan or conveyed to KNOW Bio:
•Novan retained exclusive development and commercialization rights in all fields for any products containing certain specified particles, referred to as the Novan Particles, including those in our NVN1000 API and in other NCEs we are developing.
•Novan retained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology in the Retained Dermatology Field, which is defined as the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and palliation of diseases, conditions, or disorders of the skin, nails, hair or scalp in humans or animals, and all cosmetic uses for the skin, nails, hair or scalp, other than (i) for wound care through formulations of therapeutic product specifically designed to treat chronic wounds, thermal burns, radiation injury, accidental injury, surgical sites or scars, and (ii) therapeutic uses for treating cancer, excluding basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, precancerous conditions of the skin, actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis, cutaneous horn, Bowen disease, radiation dermatosis, and dysplastic nevi. The Retained Dermatology Field was amended in 2017 as described in the section entitled “2017 Amendments to KNOW Bio Licensing Arrangements” in this Annual Report.
•KNOW Bio received exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology, excluding products containing the Novan Particles, in the KNOW Bio Field, which is defined as all fields of use except for the Retained Dermatology Field. The KNOW Bio Field was amended in 2017 as described in the section entitled “2017 Amendments to KNOW Bio Licensing Arrangements” in this Annual Report.
Under one of these exclusive license agreements, KNOW Bio granted to us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under any patents and patent applications which became controlled by KNOW Bio during the three years immediately following the execution date of such agreement and directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, but not towards medical devices, for use in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and palliation of diseases, conditions, or disorders in the Retained Dermatology Field, including but not limited to SB204, SB206, SB208, SB414 and our other presently-contemplated dermatology pipeline candidates. KNOW Bio granted us a right of first negotiation to obtain a license under any patents and patent applications generated 
by KNOW Bio during the first three years following the execution date of the agreement and directed towards medical devices to develop and commercialize licensed products in the Retained Dermatology Field. Additionally, Novan and KNOW Bio also agreed that neither party would commercialize any products in the other’s field of use during the first three years following the execution date of the agreement. The three-year period in which new patents and patent applications controlled by us or by KNOW Bio are added to the exclusive licenses and the three-year term of the commercialization non-compete both expired on December 29, 2018. Neither we nor, to our knowledge, KNOW Bio commercialized a product in the other party’s field during this period.
Additionally, we granted to KNOW Bio exclusive sublicenses, with the ability to further sublicense, under certain of the United States and foreign patents and patent applications exclusively licensed to us from UNC and another third party directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions, including certain Nitricil compounds, to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology in the KNOW Bio Field. Under the exclusive sublicense to the UNC patents and applications, KNOW Bio is subject to the terms and conditions under the consolidated license agreement with UNC, including diligence obligations and milestone payment obligations.
Under the exclusive license agreements and sublicense agreements, we retain all rights under our owned and exclusively licensed patents and patent applications with respect to development and commercialization of products for use in the Retained Dermatology Field. The exclusive license agreements and sublicense agreements will continue for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the respective agreement, unless earlier terminated, and upon expiration continues as a perpetual non-exclusive license. Under each agreement, Novan and KNOW Bio have the right to terminate the agreement by written notice for the other party’s material breach which remains uncured within 30 days of receipt of notice thereof. Novan also has the right to terminate each such agreement immediately upon written notice if KNOW Bio, its affiliates or sublicensees challenge the validity of any patent licensed in such agreement. KNOW Bio has the right to terminate each such agreement, with notice, for any reason upon ninety days advance written notice to the Company. The licenses granted by KNOW Bio to the Company in the agreements survive termination of the agreements.
2017 Amendments to KNOW Bio Licensing Arrangements
In October 2017, we entered into certain amendments, or the KNOW Bio Amendments, to the original license and sublicense agreements described above between us and KNOW Bio, or the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the KNOW Bio Amendments, we re-acquired from KNOW Bio exclusive, worldwide rights under certain United States and foreign patents and patent applications controlled by us as of the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements, and patents and patent applications which became controlled by us during the three years immediately following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements, directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, to develop and commercialize products for all diagnostic, therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative uses for any disease, condition or disorder caused by certain oncoviruses, or the Oncovirus Field. KNOW Bio also granted to us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under any patents and patent applications which became controlled by KNOW Bio during the three years immediately following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements and directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, but not towards medical devices, to develop and commercialize products for use in the Oncovirus Field. Additionally, KNOW Bio agreed that KNOW Bio would not commercialize any products in the Oncovirus Field during the first three years following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. The three-year period in which new patents and patent applications controlled by KNOW Bio are added to the exclusive license and the three-year term of the commercialization non-compete both expired on December 29, 2018.
The rights granted to us in the Oncovirus Field in the KNOW Bio Amendments continue for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the Agreements, and upon expiration continue on a perpetual non-exclusive basis, and are subject to the termination rights of KNOW Bio and us that are set forth in the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. In addition, under the KNOW Bio Amendments, KNOW Bio may terminate the rights granted to the Company in the Oncovirus Field without terminating the Original KNOW Bio Agreements.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are currently commercializing and those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our products and product candidates.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit marketing of the product for particular indications for uses in the United States.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. To support an IND to conduct clinical trials, a sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and non-clinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increased rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on its www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population with the specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3 clinical trials: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population with the specified disease or condition, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications for use. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act VII, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision as to whether it will accept the application for filing. The actual review time may be significantly longer, depending on the complexity of the review, FDA requests for additional information and the sponsor’s submission of additional information. 
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. During its review, the FDA may raise additional issues or request additional data or information, during which time, the review period is generally suspended until such requests are received. This can delay, sometimes substantially, the FDA’s review and potential approval of an application.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. 
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval, including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. 
The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs or if unexpected safety or efficacy concerns arise. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track designated product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development. In addition, the FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track designated product candidate on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1, and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission.
In addition, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform confirmatory studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may 
be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval and approval is not guaranteed. Such designation may, however, expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also limit the indications for use or may impose labeling or other requirements on the product.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Other Health Care Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, other United States federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, and transparency laws with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly 
interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government. Violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a “qui tam” action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. Under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, are required to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of pricing information and marketing expenditure as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us can result in penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our currently marketed products (and any other product candidates, if approved) by us or our commercial partners depend, in part, on the extent to which such products are covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our currently marketed products (and any other products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale) therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our products or product candidates could reduce a physician’s willingness to prescribe our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a 
drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; and created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, beginning January 1, 2024.
Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was enacted into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been 
increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Data Privacy and Security
Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to United States federal and state and foreign data privacy, security and data breach notification laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Supply Chain
We continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 and related constraints on the global workforce on our supply chain and related vendors and global supply chain constraints across various industries, including interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of raw materials, API, drug product or finished goods from third-party manufacturers due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems and potential price increases. We are also continuing to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 and global supply chain constraints on our new facility. We have completed the commissioning of our new facility to support various research and development and cGMP activities, including small-scale manufacturing capabilities for API and drug product. We are in the process of, and proceeding with the related preparatory activities associated with, qualifying and validating the manufacturing equipment for use in API production.
We currently rely on third-party suppliers to provide the raw materials that are used by us and our third-party manufacturers in the manufacture of our product candidates and commercial products. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials, including nitric oxide, that we use to manufacture our product candidates and commercial products. We also rely on third-party logistics vendors to transport our raw materials, API, and drug products through our supply chain. Certain materials, including our API, have designated hazard classifications that limit available transportation modes or quantities. Third-party logistics vendors may choose to delay or defer transportation of materials from time to time, especially in light of global supply chain constraints, which could adversely impact the timing or cost of our manufacturing supply chain activities or other associated development activities.
Manufacturing and Supplies
We have adopted a strategy of engaging with, utilizing and relying on third parties through partnerships, collaborations, licensing or other strategic relationships for the performance of activities, processes and services that (i) do not typically result in the generation of significant new intellectual property and (ii) can leverage their existing robust infrastructure, systems and facilities, as well as associated subject matter expertise. A parallel and inter-related strategic objective has been to manage our own internal resources, including our manufacturing capabilities.
Manufacturing and Supply of Commercial Products
We currently rely upon contract manufacturers to produce our commercial product portfolio and expect to continue to rely upon these contract manufacturers for any current and future EPI Health legacy product production. As with any supply agreement with contract manufacturers, obtaining finished goods of appropriate quality cannot be guaranteed. Our third-party manufacturers have other customers, depend on other third party suppliers for materials and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform their supply obligations to us satisfactorily and on a timely basis. Any of these occurrences would be beyond our control. For example, due to a manufacturing delay with one supplier, we expect that the Rhofade commercial product may be on back order in mid-March 2023 until at least early April 2023. We believe that this temporary “stock out” of Rhofade may impact the overall prescription volume for Rhofade, but we expect that there will be a temporary increase in prescription volume when the product is back in stock. We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may acquire in the future.
Preparatory Work for Product Candidates in Development
For our product candidates that are currently in development, which generally use the drug substance berdazimer sodium as the API, we have adopted a dual approach of working with third parties and developing certain focused internal manufacturing capabilities. With third parties, we are conducting manufacturing process feasibility studies with a full-scale API manufacturer that, if successfully completed, could lead to full-scale production of our API, while also establishing a strategic alliance with Orion 
Corporation, or Orion, a Finnish full-scale pharmaceutical company with broad experience in drug manufacturing, to enable technology transfer and manufacturing of clinical trial materials for future clinical trials with our topical product candidates, and if any of our product candidates are approved, commercial supply of our nitric oxide-based drug products. Importantly, the Orion alliance is being structured to support major global markets in which we and our partners may pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates. Within these arrangements with third parties, however, there are risks associated with these manufacturers that are similar to the manufacturing arrangements for our commercial products described above. Moreover, given the stage of these relationships, there are risks associated with the complexity, time and expense of technical transfer.
Internally, we have also worked to complete commissioning of our new facility to support various research and development and cGMP activities, including small-scale manufacturing capabilities for API and drug product. While we have more control over our internal manufacturing capabilities as compared to our relationships with third parties, we do face risks associated with operating a manufacturing facility, including supply chain matters, which have impacted and may further impact the validation of our new facility, and the inherent limitations that come from our internal capabilities being limited to small-scale manufacturing capabilities. 
As we move forward with these initiatives, we will need significant additional funding to continue our operating activities, including these technical transfer projects, potential utilization and development of internal capabilities and cost structure changes, and to make further advancements in our product development programs, as described in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Business Segments
We manage our operations and allocate resources in two reporting segments, which represent (i) the promotion of commercial products for the treatment of medical dermatological conditions, or the Commercial Operations segment, and (ii) research and development activities related to the Company’s nitric oxide-based technology to develop product candidates, or the Research and Development Operations segment. 
We disclose information about our reportable segments based on the way that we organize segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. See Note 20—“Segment Information” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain financial information related to our reportable segments.
Human Capital
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 89 full-time employees, in addition to 1 part-time employee.
Of the 89 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022, 44 were our dermatology sales specialists, 9 were dedicated to our Nitricil technology and formulation science research and development, 7 were dedicated to our manufacturing capability and product operations, 8 were in clinical, medical, quality and regulatory operations, 7 were in commercial operations, marketing and market access, and 14 were in general and administrative functions including executives, human resources, finance and information technology. Our 1 part-time employee as of December 31, 2022 was in our technology and formulation science research and development function. 
We also utilize consultants and contractors to support our operating activities and our employees. 
Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and key talent is critical to our success. Our business results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals. We recruit for talent in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, which periodically experiences higher turnover rates than other industries. For example, in 2022, we experienced turnover, including within our commercial sales specialists. This turnover was mitigated by a robust recruiting effort, including extensive efforts to source and interview a talented and diverse pipeline of candidates.
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to provide robust compensation and benefits to our employees, while balancing the operational needs of the Company. In addition to salaries, compensation and benefit programs include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off and other employee assistance programs. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel who are necessary to the operation of the business and the development of our product candidates is critical to our success.
