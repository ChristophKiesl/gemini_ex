Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 19, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a target business. Since the Initial Public Offering, our efforts have been limited to the search for a prospective initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in the United States in the high-tech industry. We have not identified any acquisition targets. 
 In October 2019, the sponsor purchased 2,875,000 shares of common stock par value $0.0001, or the insider shares, for an aggregate price of $25,000. The sponsor and the companys officers and directors agreed to place their insider shares into an escrow account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as escrow agent. Subject to certain limited exceptions, 50% of these shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold or released from escrow until the earlier of six months after the date of the consummation of the initial business combination and the date on which the closing price of the companys common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after the consummation of the initial business combination and the remaining 50% of the insider shares will not be transferred, assigned, sold or released from escrow until six months after the date of the consummation of the initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to the initial business combination, the company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the companys stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. 
 On October 10, 2019, the sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note. This loan was non-interest bearing, and on July 9, 2020 the Company amended such loan to provide that such loan: (A) was convertible into 600,000 private warrants issuable to the sponsor at a purchase price of $0.50 per warrant upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering; or (B) due in cash to the sponsor on the date the company determines not to proceed with the Initial Public Offering. The company fully borrowed the note amount of $300,000 as of June 30, 2020. The note was converted into 600,000 private warrants upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. 
 On July 15, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units, which included the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 units to cover over-allotments, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant, each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $115,000,000. 
 Simultaneous with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the units, we consummated the private placement of 6,800,000 private placement warrants at a price of $0.50 per private placement warrant, generating total proceeds of $3.4 million. A portion of the proceeds from the private placement warrants were added to the Initial Public offering held in the trust account. If the company does not complete a business combination within the combination period, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, 600,000 additional private placement warrants were issued to our sponsor as a result of the conversion of a promissory note.

 Upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement, a total of $115.0 million ($10.00 per share) and $2.3 million or of the private placement was placed in a trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the distribution of the Trust Account as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Transaction costs of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement amounted to approximately $7.3 million, consisting of approximately $2.3 million of underwriting costs and $4.0 million of deferred underwriting costs and the balance of approximately $973,000 to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses.

  initial acquisition transaction within our targeted industries. However, we cannot provide any assurance that an acquisition transaction will be consummated or that an acquisition transaction will involve an IT, digital entertainment, gaming or other technology company. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe our competitive strengths to be the following: 
 Our Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests than it would have as a privately held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our requirements to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination and provide holders of public shares the opportunity to convert their shares into cash from the trust account, as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. 
 Transaction Flexibility 
 We offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing cash for stock, and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and it may not be available to us. 
Our Industry Opportunity 
 Technology companies are fundamentally changing the world at an unprecedented pace by providing products and services that are establishing new markets, creating new experiences, and disrupting legacy industries. Key technological advances and practices such as cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms, open source software development, developer-focused software tools, and software-defined networking, storage and computing, are allowing technology companies to rapidly affect change in every 
 
9 


  major sector of the global economy. Spending by corporate and institutional information technology purchasers on products and services is projected to be approximately $3.9 trillion in 2020, according to Gartner. 
 In addition to corporate and institutional markets, consumer gaming markets are also experiencing rapid growth. Electronic games are a pervasive element of popular culture and integral to the modern way of life to participants known as gamers. According to Newzoo International BV (Newzoo), a global provider of esports and gaming industry research, the number of active gamers is expected to grow from approximately 2.5 billion in 2018 to approximately 2.7 billion in 2021. Spending on gaming is the fastest growing segment within the global entertainment industry with a forecast CAGR of 9.0% from 2018 to 2022. We believe global expansion in consumer gaming, esports, and entertainment sectors will require constant improvements in hardware system to meet consumer demand. 
 Agile technology companies have embraced opportunities to meet the demands of these large and dynamic institutional and consumer-oriented markets. Based on our management team and directors experience and relationships in the technology industry, we believe we have insight enabling us to identify attractive candidates for a business combination from the innovative private companies that continue to create hardware-oriented businesses and related services that are seeking access to public capital markets that will enable them to reach significant financial scale and create stockholder value.
 Corporate and institutional information technology markets. 
 There are many segments of hardware and systems comprising forecast spending on IT by institutions. While we may seek a target in any sector, and will not be limited to targets in any of the following areas, certain areas are of particular interest to us based on the intersection of their forecast growth and our network of industrial relationships. Of the $3.9 trillion global IT product and services markets referred to above, devices and data center systems  sectors that we consider to be hardware-focused  are estimated to comprise 23% or approximately $884.0 billion, a target market in which our management team has deep experience and contacts. 
 Edge Computing. The increasing deployment of sensors, software, and intelligent systems into a variety of sectors including building maintenance, manufacturing, logistics, municipal systems (smart cities) is leading to rapidly growing demand for remote intelligent monitoring and automation but also for hardware, platforms, and services related to edge computing  moving processing capability as close to end-use points in order to reduce network latency in processing for real-time automated decision-making. According to MarketsandMarkets Research, the edge computing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% from $2.8 billion in 2019 to $9.0 billion in 2024, a significant portion of which we expect to be related to hardware system and devices. 
 Smart Transportation. According to ResearchAndMarkets.com, approximately 233 million connected cars are expected to be on the road around the world by 2020.Hardware and systems related to vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid connectivity will be needed to meet projected demand. According to Allied Market Research the market for technology and products related to autonomous vehicles is estimated to increase at a CAGR of 39.5% between $54.0 billion in 2019 and $556.0 billion in 2026. Innovative companies meeting the demand for rugged, low-weight, and reliable mobile processing and sensing systems may benefit from the growth in this sector. 
 Smart Cities and Buildings. The application of sensors and local and distributed processing intelligence to improve the efficiency of building environmental, operations, and control systems is forecast to grow from $5.8 billion in 2016 to $61.9 billion in 2024 according to Zion Market Research. Spending on interconnected smart cities including links with sensing and processing intelligence between buildings, transportation networks, power grids, and other public and private systems is forecast by Grandview Research to grow at a CAGR of 18.9% from 2019 to 2025 when the global market would be approximately $238.0 billion. 
 In addition to these institutional and corporate markets, we believe there will be opportunities for us to acquire an attractive target in certain consumer-oriented markets in which hardware and technology systems play critical roles.

 Consumer gaming, esports, and entertainment markets. 
 In 2018, the global games market revenue of $137.9 billion exceeded both the global cinema and global recorded music markets. The global cinema market generated approximately $41.1 billion in 2018 according to the Motion Picture Association of America, and the global recorded music market generated approximately $19.1 billion in 2018 according to IFPIs Global Music Report. 
 Gaming hardware and systems. We believe the rise of gaming leads to an increased demand for high-performing hardware, which includes system and video processing capability and premium gaming peripherals (including high-precision mice, fully customizable keyboards, audio devices, and gaming console controllers) and systems (including laptops) that deliver a competitive edge and immersive experiences for end users. With the evolution of competitive PC gaming, the gaming peripherals market is now focused on brand recognition, player performance, features and quality. The growing popularity of competitive gaming is an important driver of the gaming peripherals market. Competitive gamers seek the best and most reliable gaming peripherals. The costs for such products are considerably higher than that of ordinary peripherals for home and business use, which are manufactured by brands, such as Microsoft, HP, and Dell that do not specialize in gaming peripherals. According to Newzoo, the global gaming peripherals market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 9.9% from 2017 and is expected to reach $3.6 billion in 2021. We believe gamers will continue to regularly upgrade their processing platforms and peripherals because the quality and performance of gaming hardware are important to the overall user experience, especially if gamers participate intensively or in a competitive setting. 
 Global esports. According to Newzoo, with a global audience of 395 million people in 2018, professional competitive games, also known as esports, has become a standalone industry, generating around $865.0 million in sponsorships, advertising, fees from game publishers, media rights, merchandise and tickets in 2018. Global esports revenue is forecasted to be $1.8 billion in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 17.8% from 2019. Brands, media and sports companies across the globe are increasingly investing in this industry. The global esports audience is expected to grow from 454 million in 2019 to 645 million in 2022, a 12.4% CAGR. China has the largest esports audience with approximately 125 million people in 2018 and is expected to remain the largest in 2021, growing to 218 million at a CAGR of more than 20%. We believe early movers in this market have an opportunity to capitalize on the growth of this segment which has emerged as a standalone industry. We believe our relationships in China and throughout the Asia-Pacific region will be an attractive characteristic for esports-related target companies seeking improved commercial access to those large markets. 
 Digital Entertainment. Global expansion of high-speed internet infrastructure and smartphone market penetration rates provide the foundation for widespread, worldwide access to live and pre-recorded streaming entertainment. From a demographics perspective, there is a growing demand for entertainment services and products from younger consumers who are early adopters of technology, use digital devices including PCs and smartphones more often than other generations, and have a willingness to purchase digital products and services. In addition, economic trends such as the rising per capita average income in many countries which leads to rising purchasing power and increased propensity to spend are also likely to continue to drive demand for entertainment products and services in emerging economies. Our management team and directors have relationships with a variety of entertainment content producers who may want to enhance their access to capital and their brand visibility by going public. In addition, advances in technology combined with changing consumer consumption preferences drives innovation in the digital entertainment market that, in turn, may create a large commercial opportunity for the producers of innovative hardware and processing platforms. For example, while the market for dedicated e-readers is projected to decline, the global virtual reality market for consumer entertainment, divided into hardware and software segments, is forecast to reach $16.3 billion in size in 2022 worldwide with hardware representing approximately $10.0 billion of that total according to Statista. We believe our management team and boards experience and industry relationships will enable us to identify high-growth and profitable target candidates that support both the creation of digital content and the hardware necessary to create, distribute, and consume this content. 
 The statistics cited above are illustrative of the potential growth opportunities for innovative hardware and systems-oriented companies selling to industrial and institutional customers. We intend to explore target 
 
11 


  opportunities in a wide variety of sectors. While these are currently areas of interest in which our management and directors have extensive relationships, we may or may not include these sectors in search for a business combination target. 
 Our Acquisition Strategy 
 Our acquisition strategy is to identify and acquire a target with untapped potential within our target industries and assist the current management and owners with building a public company that will be attractive to investors. We believe that our management team and directors experiences in evaluating assets, structuring and closing investments, and building companies will enable us to source high-quality targets. Based on the collective business and acquisition experiences of our founders and management team, we will seek to identify and target businesses in the most innovative subsectors within corporate and institutional IT markets and the consumer-oriented gaming and digital entertainment industries. Since our management team is comprised of U.S. citizens with extensive networks and experience in Asia, our strategy also includes placing a priority on targets that can benefit from our ability to help expand their sales and distribution in the Asia-Pacific region, and in select cases, improve their global supply chain management. In addition, while we may consider business combinations with companies of any financial profile, we intend to prioritize acquiring cash-flow positive operating businesses as well as businesses that we believe can achieve long-term appreciation. In addition, we believe a prospective target business will benefit from our involvement, including through developing potential strategic relationships by leveraging our founders extensive network, as well by our assisting the target in areas such as intellectual property and corporate finance. Our selection process will leverage our founders network of industry, private equity and venture capital sponsor relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants that we believe should provide us with significant acquisition transaction opportunities. 
 We are focusing on targeting companies in the most innovative subsectors within the gaming, hardware, and digital media industries.

 Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will have until 18 months from the Initial Public Offering to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public warrants will expire and will be worthless. In the event that the Company fails to consummate a business combination within the 18 months it must liquidate and dissolve and distribute its assets in the trust account to the public stockholders. 
 We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose, at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of amount required to pay our income and franchise taxes), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of amount required to pay our income and franchise taxes), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Any tender offer documents used in connection with a business combination will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SECs proxy rules. 
 The initial per public share redemption or conversion price will be $10.00 per share, regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. 
 Pursuant to the rules of the NYSE American, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. Therefore, the fair market value of the target business will be calculated prior to any conversions of our shares in connection with a business combination and therefore will be a minimum of $88.8 million in order to satisfy the 80% test. While the fair market value of the target business must satisfy the 80% test, the consideration we pay the owners of the target business may be a combination of cash (whether cash from the trust account or cash from a debt or equity financing transaction that closes concurrently with the business combination) or our equity securities. The exact nature and amount of consideration would be determined based on negotiations with the target business, although we will attempt to primarily use our equity as transaction consideration. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will also obtain a fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm before consummating a business combination with an entity affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders. If we are no longer listed on NYSE, we will not be required to satisfy the 80% test. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives 
 
13 


  of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. 
 Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test. 
 Our sponsor has purchased from us an aggregate of 6,800,000 private warrants at a purchase price of $0.50 per private warrant, or $3,400,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. We placed $2,300,000 of these proceeds in the trust account so that at least $10.00 per share sold to the public in the Initial Public Offering were deposited into the trust account. Upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, 600,000 additional private placement warrants were issued to our sponsor as a result of the conversion of a promissory note. Each private warrant is identical to the public warrants sold except the private warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees. The capital from such private placements may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, and any excess capital from such private placement will be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. As a result, the equity interest of investors in the combined company may be diluted and the market prices for our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, if the per share trading price of our shares of common stock is greater than the price per share paid in the private placement, the private placement will result in value dilution to you, in addition to the immediate dilution that you will experience in connection with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. See Dilution. 
 Primerose has also entered into an agreement with us providing that it will hold at least 1,000,000 shares of our common stock following our initial business combination. Primeroses commitment to hold at least 1,000,000 shares of our common stock following our initial business combination by open market purchases of our shares or units prior to our initial business combination, or by a purchase (for $10.00 per share or up to $10.0 million in the aggregate) in a private placement that would occur concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination. 
 As more fully discussed in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Conflicts of Interest, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain relevant pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and 
 
14 


  exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period until we are no longer an emerging growth company. be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Financial Position 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $115.0 million held in the trust account, not taking into account $4.0 million of deferred underwriting fees to be paid. With the funds available, we offer a partner business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the partner business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 General 
 We intend to utilize cash derived from the Initial Public offering and the private placement of private warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of private warrants are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, investors are investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. Our initial business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination. 
Sources of Target Businesses 
 While we have not yet identified our initial business combination candidates, we believe based on our managements business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous business combination candidates. Target business candidates are being brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of 
 
15 


  these sources will have read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. We may engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions or mergers in the future, in which event we may pay a finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our insiders or any of the members of our management team be paid any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors, or insiders. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (1) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) and (2) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no affiliated entities that we would consider as a business combination target. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 Subject to our management teams fiduciary duties and the limitation that one or more target businesses have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Additionally, there is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
 Accordingly, there is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete a business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. The valuation of a financially unstable company or early stage company can be more complicated than the calculation of a mature, stable company, and any valuation we make on such a company would be based, in part, on its prospects and how successful we believe the business will be once the company matures or is stabilized. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following: 
 

 | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | growth potential;
--+------------------


 | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------


 | return on equity or invested capital;
--+--------------------------------------


 | market capitalization or enterprise value;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


 | competitive position;
--+----------------------


 | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


 | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------

 

16 


 
 | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


 | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


 | costs associated with effecting the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and/or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Our management may not consider any of the above criteria in evaluating a prospective target business. The retention of our officers and directors following the completion of any business combination will not be a material consideration in our evaluation of a prospective target business. 
 Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties. 
 The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination. 
 Fair Market Value of Target Business 
 Pursuant to NYSE listing rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may structure a business combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. If we are no longer listed on NYSE, we will not be required to satisfy the 80% test. 
 We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital 
 
17 


  stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). We are not required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least 80% of the balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such determination on its own. The board of directors, in light of its fiduciary obligation to stockholders, would be required to determine whether it is capable of valuing the target company based on the experience of its members in valuing companies and whether the board was actually able to reach a determination of value with respect to the particular target company. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business Management Team 
 Although we intend to scrutinize the management team of a prospective target business for, among other things, their ability to manage a company with securities that are publicly traded, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination, our assessment of the target business management team may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management team may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 
18 


 Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination 
 In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their
 pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their
 pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their
 pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some
 pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SECs proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. 
 We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 18 months from the Initial Public Offering in order to be able to receive a
 pro rata share of the trust account. 
 Our initial stockholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction, we would need only 4,312,501 of our public shares (or approximately 37.5% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming that only a quorum was present at the meeting, that our sponsor votes in favor of the transaction, and that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in the Initial Public Offering or units or shares in the after-market). 
 None of our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock in the Initial Public Offering or from persons in the open market or in private 
 
19 


  transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a companys stock. 
 Conversion/Tender Rights 
 At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their
 pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their
 pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares. 
 Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public stockholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company. 
 Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to or in the Initial Public Offering or in the aftermarket. 
 We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock into the right to receive a
 pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders. 
 
20 


 Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). 
 If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable
 pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders. 
 Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination 
 If we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the warrants will expire and holders of warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such warrants, and the warrants will be worthless. 
 Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 18th month from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. 
 
21 


 We will seek to have all third parties we engage at any time and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. The underwriters in the Initial Public Offering will execute such a waiver agreement. 
 As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that third parties, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by third parties for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, or any reductions in the value of the trust assets, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.00 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations, as we have not required our sponsor to retain any assets to provide for its indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that our sponsor will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, our sponsor will not be liable to our public stockholders and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than approximately $10.00 (whether or not the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below. 
 If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their insider shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and from the interest income on the balance of the trust account (net income and other tax obligations) that may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $50,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders. 
 Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have 
 
22 


  us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. 
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00. 
 If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons 
 Certificate of Incorporation 
 Our certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we hold a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity (including the substance or timing within which we have to complete a business combination), we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in connection with any such vote. Our insiders have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any insider shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 

 | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we will consummate our initial business combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 18 months of the closing of the Initial Public Offering, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account to all of our public holders of shares of common stock;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, $115.0 million was placed into the trust account;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 


 
 | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential Revisions to Agreements with Insiders 
 Each of our insiders has entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which each of them has agreed to do certain things relating to us and our activities prior to a business combination. We could seek to amend these letter agreements without the approval of stockholders, although we have no intention to do so. In particular: 

 | Restrictions relating to liquidating the trust account if we failed to consummate a business combination in the timeframes specified above could be amended, but only if we allowed all stockholders to redeem their shares in connection with such amendment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Restrictions relating to our insiders being required to vote in favor of a business combination or against any amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow our insiders to vote on a transaction as they wished;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The requirement of members of the management team to remain our officer or director until the closing of a business combination could be amended to allow persons to resign from their positions with us if, for example, the current management team was having difficulty locating a target business and another management team had a potential target business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The restrictions on transfer of our securities could be amended to allow transfer to third parties who were not members of our original management team;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The obligation of our management team to not propose amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow them to propose such changes to our stockholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The obligation of insiders to not receive any compensation in connection with a business combination could be modified in order to allow them to receive such compensation; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The requirement to obtain a valuation for any target business affiliated with our insiders, in the event it was too expensive to do so.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Except as specified above, stockholders would not be required to be given the opportunity to redeem their shares in connection with such changes. Such changes could result in: 
 

 | Our insiders being able to vote against a business combination or in favor of changes to our organizational documents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our operations being controlled by a new management team that our stockholders did not elect to invest with;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our insiders receiving compensation in connection with a business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our insiders closing a transaction with one of their affiliates without receiving an independent valuation of such business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will not agree to any such changes unless we believed that such changes were in the best interests of our stockholders (for example, if we believed such a modification were necessary to complete a business combination). Each of our officers and directors have fiduciary obligations to us requiring that they act in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other

  blank check companies, venture capital firms, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources, which could be reduced further because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public stockholders as well as any tender offer we conduct. Our management team is not experienced in pursuing business combinations on behalf of blank check companies. Other blank check companies may be sponsored and managed by individuals with prior experience in completing business combinations between blank check companies and target businesses. Our managements lack of experience may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. These inherent limitations give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. 
 Facilities 
 We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 4601 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 240, Los Angeles, California 90010. The space is provided to us by our sponsor, at no cost. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We have three executive officers, Peter Kuo as our chief executive officer, Timothy Chen as our chief financial officer and Ker Zhang as our Secretary. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements 
 We have registered our units, common stocks and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States GAAP or IFRS as issued by the IASB. A particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate may not have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination with the proposed target business.

 We may be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have our internal control over financial reporting audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of their internal control over financial reporting. The development of the internal control over financial reporting of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such initial business combination. 
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or our total revenues exceed $1.0 billion or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250.0 million as of the end of that years second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100.0 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of that years second fiscal quarter. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our founding team in their capacity as such.
