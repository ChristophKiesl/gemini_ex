ITEM 1. OUR BUSINESS

Air Group operates Alaska, Virgin America and Horizon Air. We completed the acquisition of Virgin America on December 14, 2016, at which time Virgin America became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Together with our regional partner airlines, we fly to 118 destinations with nearly 1,200 daily departures through our expansive network across the United States, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica and Cuba. With our global airline partners, we can provide our guests with a virtual network of more than 900 destinations worldwide. During 2016, we carried an all-time high 34 million guests and earned adjusted net income of $911 million, which includes operating and financial results for Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and excludes pretax special items and merger-related costs of $117 million.
Our acquisition of Virgin America positions us as the fifth largest airline in the U.S., with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers. Virgin America provides a platform for growth of our low-fare, premium product providing a powerful West Coast network for our guests as well as enhanced international partnerships. Additionally, Virgin America provides an opportunity to grow and improve our loyalty program while gaining access to constrained gates, particularly on the East Coast. The combined company now provides more seats from the West Coast than any other carrier, allowing us to serve our guests better. 
Our mission is "creating an airline people love." The "ing" is to recognize we are never done—we are continually working to get better. We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation, develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares, and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively. It is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just our performance, but also our people, our community and our environment.
While aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation, we recognize this is fundamentally a people business. Our employees maintain and strengthen our relationships with guests, and our success depends on our employees working together to successfully execute our strategy. In 2016, Alaska was once again named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine. We know that engaged employees provide excellent service. In that vein, in 2016, Alaska ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by J.D. Power and Associates for the ninth year in a row and Virgin America was recognized for excellent service by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure magazine also for the ninth year in a row. Customer service matters, and we believe the combination of our airlines will only enhance the experience for our guests. 
Operationally, Alaska has held the No. 1 spot in the Wall Street Journal's "Middle Seat" scorecard for U.S. airlines for four consecutive years. We have been the leader in the industry for on-time performance among major airlines for the past seven years. For achieving safety, customer service, operational and financial goals, we rewarded our employees with a record $127 million in incentive pay during 2016. Including incentives earned during the year prior to the acquisition by Virgin America employees, the total is $159 million. 
In support of the communities that we serve, we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship. In 2016, we improved fuel efficiency by 1.4% from the prior year, as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon. We also flew the first two commercial flights using sustainable alcohol-to-jet biofuel made from U.S. grown corn and alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals, highlighting our commitment to environmental stewardship. Our combined fleet is one of the youngest, most fuel-efficient fleets in North America and we look forward to further enhancements in this area. Air Group donated $13 million to over 1,300 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 27,000 hours of community service. Virgin America has also been active in community service and charitable giving. Our efforts focus on youth and education, medical research and transportation and community outreach. One of our leadership principals is to "give back" and we are proud of the efforts and volunteerism of our employees across the system. 
We earned record financial results in 2016, marking our 13th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis. We achieved an after-tax return on invested capital of 21.3%, well above our weighted average cost of capital. Although we incurred a significant amount of new debt in 2016 to fund the Virgin America acquisition, our liquidity and capital position still remain strong and are among those of high-quality industrial companies. Due to our strong financial health and outlook, we are one of only three U.S. airlines with investment grade credit ratings. With the cash generated by the continued success we have had in the past decade, we have been able to invest in our business to achieve profitable growth and to enhance the customer experience. Most recently, we launched our Premium Class service on our Boeing 737 aircraft, which includes more legroom, early boarding, free cocktails and premium snacks.

As we look to the future, we will build on our success by executing our strategic plan in the following areas: 
Be Safe and On time
We have an unwavering commitment to run a safe and compliant operation, and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives. Alaska and Horizon were the first U.S. major airlines to receive Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") validation and acceptance of our Safety Management System ("SMS") in the third quarter of 2016. SMS helps identify and manage risk and builds a sustainable culture of safety for Air Group employees. We have an initiative to add Virgin America to the SMS program in 2017. Once again, for 2016, 100% of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the FAA's "Diamond Certificate of Excellence" award. This is the 15th consecutive year Alaska Airlines has received the award and the 15th time in the last 17 years for Horizon. We also believe that maintaining safe and compliant operations, through adherence to well defined processes and ensuring every Air Group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation, is critical to ensuring on-time performance. The rigor we apply to running a safe and compliant operation has resulted in Alaska being named the No. 1 on-time carrier in North America for the seventh year in a row by FlightStats. 
Focus on People
Our success depends on our people. Higher employee engagement drives higher productivity, superior execution and better customer service, which is why we listen to our employees for feedback in shaping our strategy. Employee engagement scores from our annual employee survey are at historical highs. We have designed customer-service workshops and leadership training that cover virtually all employees and do these on an ongoing basis. As we integrate Alaska and Virgin America, in January 2017 we rolled out "Momentum" training for all Virgin America employees to help bridge the two airlines and blend our cultures. For our Horizon employees, we are conducting "QX Factor," a program with the goal of improving culture, engagement and communication.
We understand that aligning our employees' goals with Air Group's goals is important in achieving success. The majority of Air Group employees, including Virgin America employees starting in 2017, participate in our Performance-Based Pay ("PBP") and Operational Performance Rewards ("OPR") programs, which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety, profitability, on-time performance, low costs and customer loyalty and satisfaction. Over the last five years, our incentive programs have paid out on average, over 8.7% of annual pay, or more than one month's pay, for most employees. 
Build a deep emotional connection for our brand
We want to be recognized as the preferred airline to fly for people living on the West Coast. In January 2016, we introduced a bold new brand expression, including an updated identity, livery, and look and feel for our digital and physical experiences. In January 2017, subsequent to year end, we were the first airline to launch Free Chat—a feature that allows our guests to text for free in-flight. We believe there is an opportunity to deepen the emotional connection with our guests as we continue to expand and grow. Our updated brand expression draws upon our rich heritage while infusing it with additional warmth and energy to better reflect how guests feel about our brand and the great service that we pride ourselves in delivering. 
We continue to invest in a better customer experience. Onboard, guests will continue to enjoy more of what they love with free and premium entertainment direct to their devices, Pacific Northwest-inspired food and beverages, custom leather seats with power outlets at every seat and larger overhead bins for carry-on bags. As mentioned previously, we have also recently launched our new Premium Class section in the main cabin with increased legroom and other amenities and improved our First Class with five additional inches of leg room.
Defend and grow our customer base
The merger with Virgin America provides an amazing opportunity for our new Alaska Air Group. We have a network that provides unparalleled utility and options for our guests living on the West Coast. Competition in our markets is fierce and we know we must defend our customer base as we use our combined network as an opportunity to grow that base. We will be introducing new guests to our award-winning service, Mileage Plan™ program, and affinity credit card as we grow our network. Guests from our airlines already benefit from codeshare and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits, including earning and redeeming rewards on both carriers. Elite members of the Virgin America Elevate® program and Alaska's Mileage Plan™ also receive priority boarding on both carriers. We work hard to ensure our guests have a great experience on our airlines and are provided an exceptional product at a low fare.

Win with low costs and low fares
We believe that our low-fare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing value to and building trust with our guests. We also know that, in order to provide low fares in our growing network, while returning value to our shareholders, it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure. In 2016, we lowered our unit costs, excluding fuel, by 0.8% on a consolidated basis, representing the seventh consecutive year of annual reduction. We achieved this through a continued focus on productivity, cost management, and by leveraging capacity growth. We increased employee productivity in 2016 and will continue to focus on that metric as we grow. We also manage fuel costs by flying larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft, which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 7.0% over the last five years. As we integrate Virgin America into our operations, we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals. It is critical that we achieve these goals in order to continue our cost reduction efforts. 
During fiscal 2016, we added 17 new markets to the combined network. For 2017, we plan to grow our system-wide capacity approximately 8.5% as compared to the full year 2016 combined capacity of Air Group and Virgin America. 
AIR GROUP
Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of Alaska, Virgin America, Horizon and other business units. Although Alaska, Virgin America and Horizon operate as airlines, the business plans, competition and economic risks differ substantially for Horizon in comparison to Alaska and Virgin America. Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937. Virgin America is a California corporation that was incorporated in 2004 and acquired by Air Group on December 14, 2016. Horizon is a Washington corporation that began service and was incorporated in 1981. It was acquired by Air Group in 1986. Alaska and Virgin America operate fleets of narrowbody passenger jets. Together, the operations of Alaska and Virgin America are referred to as "mainline" operations. Alaska also contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. ("SkyWest") and Peninsula Airways, Inc. ("PenAir") for regional capacity such that Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon currently operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement ("CPA"). In 2017, Horizon will begin operating E175 regional jets. The majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers. The percentage of revenues by category is as follows:

 | 2016(a) | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
Mainline passenger revenue | 69 | % | | 70 | % | 70 | % | | 70 | % | 71 | %

MAINLINE
The mainline operations include Boeing 737 ("B737") and Airbus family ("A319" and "A320") jet service offered by Alaska and Virgin America. We offer extensive passenger service from the western U.S. throughout the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica and Cuba. Our largest concentration of departures is in Seattle. We also offer cargo service throughout our network and have dedicated cargo aircraft that operate primarily to and within the state of Alaska. 

In 2016, we carried 25 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations. At December 31, 2016, our mainline operating fleet consisted of 155 B737 jet aircraft and 63 Airbus A320 family jet aircraft compared to 147 B737 aircraft as of December 31, 2015.

REGIONAL

Our regional operations consist of flights operated by Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir. In 2016, our regional operations carried approximately 9 million revenue passengers, primarily in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. Horizon is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest and carries about 83% of Air Group's regional revenue passengers. 
Based on 2016 passenger enplanements on regional aircraft, our leading airports are Seattle and Portland. At December 31, 2016, Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 52 Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. The regional fleet operated by SkyWest consisted of 15 E175 aircraft.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS 
We currently maintain two frequent flyer plans: the Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan™ and the Virgin America Elevate®.
Mileage Plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits. Miles can be earned by flying on Alaska or on one of our 24 airline partners, by using the Alaska Airlines credit card, or through other non-airline partners. Our extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances, making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer programs and have access to a large network of over 900 worldwide travel 
 7

destinations. Further, members can receive 30,000 bonus miles upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and earn triple miles on purchases made on Alaska flights or on alaskaair.com. Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for $99 plus taxes, with no restrictions or black-out dates, and a free first checked bag for up to seven people traveling in the same itinerary. Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or on any of our partner airlines, or for upgrades to First Class and Premium Class on Alaska Airlines. All of these benefits give our Mileage Plan™ members more value for their travel on Alaska, leading us to receive the highest ranking in customer satisfaction amongst traditional carriers in North America from J.D. Power and Associates for the last nine consecutive years.
Mileage Plan™ revenues represented approximately 12% of Air Group's total revenues in 2016. Mileage Plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide. 
The Elevate® program allows guests to earn points for purchasing travel that are redeemable for travel awards throughout our network and the networks of Virgin America's airline partners. Elevate® members have been introduced to the Mileage Plan™ program and, over time, the two programs will become one. Currently, our guests from both airlines enjoy codeshare and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits, including earning and redeeming rewards on both carriers. Elite members of each frequent flyer program receive priority boarding on both carriers.
AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES
Our agreements fall into three different categories: Frequent Flyer, Codeshare and Interline agreements. Frequent Flyer agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our Mileage Plan™ and Elevate® members. Alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flyer programs for our Mileage Plan™ members through our frequent flyer partnerships with 24 domestic and international carriers. 
Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers. The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement. For example, in a free-sale arrangement, the marketing carrier sells the operating carrier's inventory without any restriction; whereas in a block space arrangement, a fixed amount of seats is sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier. The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers, along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption. 
Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive, single-fare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination. An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other, and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers. Frequent flyer, codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests. 
We have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities. Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by:

• | offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage credit/redemption opportunities, including elite qualifying miles on all of our major U.S. and international airline partners;


• | giving our frequent flyer program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with carriers from all three of the major global alliances;


• | giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and


• | providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska, Virgin America and our regional affiliates while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs.


Most of our codeshare relationships are free-sale codeshares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. Our marketing agreements have various termination dates, and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time. 
On December 19, 2016 we announced the termination of our codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines ("Delta"), effective April 30, 2017. Our interline agreement with Delta will continue. We expect the impact to our guests in 2017 to be minimal due to growth in Alaska's own network, in large part from our acquisition of Virgin America, and our ability to codeshare with other 
 8

partners. We also believe the financial exposure from the termination of our codeshare agreement with Delta will be immaterial to our financial results in 2017.

OTHER REVENUE
Other revenue consists of freight and mail, certain frequent flyer and ancillary revenue. While some of our product features are included in our base pricing, we have unbundled certain ancillary features that our guests separately value. Major ancillary revenue products include checked bag fees, change fees and lounge memberships. We also promote and sell products in-flight to enhance the guest experience, including our Tom Douglas signature meals, snacks, alcoholic beverages, in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi. Total other revenue, excluding frequent flyer program revenue, represents about 7% of our total revenues.
GENERAL
The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties, including economic conditions, volatile fuel prices, industry instability, new competition, a largely unionized work force, the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital, government regulation—including taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents. Airlines have high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft ownership and facilities rents. Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results. In other words, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results. Passenger demand and ticket prices are, to a large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global economic and political events, and total available airline seat capacity.
In 2016, the airline industry reported historically high revenues and profits, as the global economy continued to recover and oil prices remained low. As the industry strengthens, airlines are now making significant investments in airports, in new planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering. Thus, the level of competition is expected to increase. 
FUEL
Our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel. The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control, and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results. Over the past five years, aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18% to 35% of operating expenses. Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the U.S.

The prices we have paid for crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of $43 per barrel in 2016 to a high of $98 in 2013. For us, a $1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately $18 million of fuel cost annually. Said another way, a one-cent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately $7 million per year.
Refining margins, which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel, are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years. Average annual refining margin prices have fluctuated between $13 per barrel and $36 per barrel in the last five years, and averaged $13 in 2016.
 10

Generally, West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast. Our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased 19% in 2016, 39% in 2015 and 6% in 2014.
The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins, as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows:

 | 2016 (a) | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
Crude oil | 69 | % | | 62 | % | 72 | % | | 71 | % | 65 | %
Refining margins | 20 | % | | 26 | % | 18 | % | | 19 | % | 25 | %
Other(b) | 11 | % | | 12 | % | 10 | % | | 10 | % | 10 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %
Aircraft fuel expense | 18 | % | | 22 | % | 32 | % | | 34 | % | 35 | %


(a) | Includes information for Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016.


(b) | Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges, unrealized mark-to-market fuel hedge gains or losses, taxes and other into-plane costs.

We use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Historically, we have had jet fuel refining margin swap contracts, but we discontinued the use of the refining margin swaps in 2014. Call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil, limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption. With call options, we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices, and during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. We begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption.
We believe that operating fuel-efficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices. Alaska operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet, Virgin America operates an all-Airbus A320 family fleet, and Horizon currently operates an all-Bombardier Q400 turboprop fleet. Air Group's fuel-efficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon ("ASMs/g") improved from 74.5 ASMs/g in 2012 to 79.7 ASMs/g in 2016. These improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate, but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit.
COMPETITION
Competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable. Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and, to a lesser extent, other forms of transportation. Competition can be direct, in the form of another carrier flying the exact non-stop route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities non-stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. We compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes. Our largest competitor is Delta, who has significantly increased their capacity in Seattle over the past few years. Approximately 61% of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta. Based on schedules filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation, we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 5% in the first half of 2017, weighted based on our network. 
We believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests:

• | Customer service and reputation

We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as on-time performance, guest amenities—including first class and other premium seating, quality of on-board products, aircraft type and comfort. In 2016, Alaska Airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by J.D. Power and Associates for the ninth year in a row. In 2016 we began installing Boeing Space Bins on our Boeing 737-900ER fleet, providing additional overhead bin space for our guests. In 2017, we are launching a Premium Class of service on our B737 aircraft that will provide extra legroom, early boarding, premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage. Additionally, in 2017 we are increasing the distance between seats in our first class cabins on the Alaska B737-900 and B737-900ER fleet, providing significantly more space for guests flying in the first class cabin. We expect to fully complete the first class cabin upgrades on the B737-900 and B737-900ER fleet in early 2018.

Cabins of our Virgin America Airbus A320 family fleet have a distinctive appearance through innovative design and use of technology. Every cabin features special mood lighting, designed to create a calming, low-stress environment for our guests; custom leather seats, tailored to provide comfort, especially on our long-haul flights; inflight wireless internet access; and electrical power outlets adjacent to every seat. All of our guests flying on Virgin America aircraft have access to the Red® inflight entertainment system that allows each guest to customize his or her inflight experience through a host of entertainment options, on-demand food and beverage ordering system and a seat-to-seat chat function.
Our employees are a key element of our product. We have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a high degree of service and hospitality to our guests both at the airport and in flight. We heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys.


• | Fares and ancillary services

The pricing of fares is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry, and the increased availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts. Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market-specific capacity, market share per route/geographic area, cost structure, fare vs. ancillary revenue strategies, and demand. 
For example, airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors. In addition, traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers, while low-cost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks, potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile (the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile), which in turn may enable them to lower their fares. These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole.
Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers, representing approximately 82% of total seats. Accordingly, if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets, we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors, often resulting in year-over-year decreases in our yields. We will defend our core markets vigorously and, if necessary, redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand. We believe the restructuring we've completed over the past decade has decreased our costs, enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning appropriate returns for our shareholders.

• | Routes served, flight schedules, codesharing and interline relationships, and frequent flyer programs

We also compete with other airlines based on markets served, the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities. Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do, and they offer significantly more international routes. In order to expand opportunities for our guests, we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges. These relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own, gain exposure in markets we don't serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles. Our frequent flyer programs offer some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 24 of our partner carriers. 
In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes, we compete with ground transportation in our short-haul markets.  Our airlines, to some extent, also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internet-based meeting tools that have changed the need for, or frequency, of face-to-face business meetings.
TICKET DISTRIBUTION

Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels:


• | Direct to customer: It is less expensive for us to sell through our direct channels at alaskaair.com and virginamerica.com. As a result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our websites. In addition, we believe this channel is preferable from a branding and customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly.


• | Traditional and online travel agencies: Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS) to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines. Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline. Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies. Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution costs.

 12



• | Reservation call centers: The Alaska call centers are located in Phoenix, AZ, Kent, WA, and Boise, ID. Virgin America uses an outsourced call center. We generally charge a $15 fee for booking reservations through the Alaska call centers and $20 for booking reservations through the Virgin America call centers. We plan on combining the reservations call centers over the next several months as part of our integration efforts.

Our sales by channel are as follows: 

 | 2016 (a) | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013 | | 2012
Direct to customer | 61 | % | | 60 | % | 57 | % | | 55 | % | 54 | %
Traditional agencies | 23 | % | | 23 | % | 25 | % | | 27 | % | 27 | %
Online travel agencies | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 12 | % | | 13 | % | 13 | %

(a) | Includes results for Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016.

SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS
Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers. Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel, including increased activity in the state of Alaska. However, we have significantly improved the seasonality of our operations by our continued growth from the West Coast to leisure destinations, like Hawaii and Costa Rica, and expanding to leisure and business destinations in the mid-continental and eastern U.S.
In addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include: 

• | general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand,

•      changes in fuel costs,


• | pricing initiatives by us or our competitors,


• | increases in competition at our primary airports, and


• | increases or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs.


Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers. Due to our geographic area of operations, we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, than some of our competitors, who may be better able to spread weather-related risks over larger route systems. We also are more susceptible to ground delays due to our heavy concentration of departures from San Francisco International Airport.
No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers.
EMPLOYEES
Our business is labor intensive. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 19,112 (12,224 at Alaska, 3,252 at Virgin America and 3,636 at Horizon) active full-time and part-time employees. Wages and benefits, including variable incentive pay, represented approximately 40% of our total non-fuel operating expenses in both 2016 and 2015.
Most major airlines, including Alaska and Horizon, have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand. At December 31, 2016, labor unions represented 84% of Alaska’s and 43% of Horizon’s employees. Inflight teammates, our term for flight attendants at Virgin America, and pilots at Virgin America voted to be represented by unions on 
 13

August 13, 2014 and June 4, 2015, respectively. However, as of December 31, 2016 neither Virgin America work group had completed collective bargaining agreement negotiations.
Our relations with U.S. labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act ("RLA"). Under this act, collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board ("NMB") to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in self-help.
Alaska’s union contracts at December 31, 2016 were as follows: 

Union | Employee Group | Number of Employees | Contract Status
Air Line Pilots Association International (ALPA) | Pilots | 1,834 | | Amendable 03/31/2018

REGULATION

GENERAL

The airline industry is highly regulated, most notably by the federal government. The Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.

• | DOT: In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT. Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms of the certificates. While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation, the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers, international and some domestic route authorities, Essential Air Service market subsidies, carrier liability for personal or property damage, and certain airport rates and charges disputes. International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the U.S. and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights. The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of “consumer protection” regulations, covering subjects such as advertising, passenger communications, denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response. Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT from time to time for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.


• | FAA: The FAA, through Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and flight operation standards. Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate. Each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs. At this time, we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.


• | TSA: Airlines serving the U.S. must operate a TSA-approved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (AOSSP), and comply with TSA Security Directives (SDs) and regulations. Under TSA authority, we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of $5.60 per one-way trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security measures. Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP, SDs or security regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.

The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act. To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties.
 16

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY MATTERS

We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and the Oil Pollution Control Act. We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations. We maintain our safety, health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements.
We believe there may be local or federal legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. Over the course of several years, we have transitioned to more fuel-efficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions.

Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.
INSURANCE
We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements. The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance, War and Allied Perils, and Workers’ Compensation. In addition, we currently carry a Cyber Liability policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties. 
We believe that our emphasis on safety and our state-of-the-art flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance.
