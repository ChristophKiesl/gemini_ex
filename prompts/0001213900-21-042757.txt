Item 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are incorporated in the state of Nevada. Prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020, as more specifically described below, Joway Health Industries Group Inc. (the “Company” or “Joway Health”), through our PRC Operating Entities, were engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sales of tourmaline-related healthcare products. Our principal executive offices were located at No. 19. Baowang Road, Baodi Economic Development Zone, Tianjin City, P.R.China 301800.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we become a shell company as a result of the Merger described below as we no longer have any business operations.
 
Recent Developments
 
Effects of COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers and suppliers. To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and after-sale processes. Beginning in Q1 2020, we made numerous process updates across our operations nationwide, and adapted our fulfillment network, to implement employee and customer safety measures, such as enhanced cleaning and physical distancing, personal protective gear, disinfectant spraying, and temperature checks. We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving state and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities.
 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our PRC subsidiaries were temporarily shut down from February 1st, 2020 to March 31st, 2020. Our business was negatively impacted and generated lower revenue and net income in 2020. Revenues from our PRC subsidiaries which had been disposed on December 31, 2020 were $225,419 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $383,755, or 63%, compared to $609,174 in the same period of last year. The decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 was mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition will depend on the virus’ future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on the Company’s customers, which are still uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this point of time.
 
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 20, 2020, Joway Health entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Dynamic Elite International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Dynamic Elite”), Crystal Globe Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Crystal Globe”) and Joway Merger Subsidiary Limited, a British Virgin Islands company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crystal Globe (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Dynamic Elite (the “Merger”), with Dynamic Elite continuing as the surviving corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crystal Globe. The special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
Crystal Globe, as the majority shareholder holding approximately 86.81% of the Company, is also the sole shareholder of Dynamic Elite. Mr. Jinghe Zhang, as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Director, and the majority beneficial owner of the Company, also serves as sole shareholder and executive director of Crystal Globe. As a result, the Company and Dynamic Elite are under common control of Crystal Globe and Mr. Jinghe Zhang.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) and as a result of the Merger, the ordinary shares of common stock of Dynamic Elite issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of which are held by the Company, were cancelled and extinguished. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, Crystal Globe has offered to pay cash consideration to the Company of $0.045 per share for the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company (the “Merger Consideration”). At the date of the Merger Agreement, we had 20,054,000 shares of common stock outstanding.

The consummation of the Merger was subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, (i) the Merger having not then been enjoined, made illegal or otherwise prohibited by any applicable law or any order, judgment, decree, injunction or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of any governmental authority (each, a “Governmental Order”) or by any proceeding then pending by a governmental authority seeking any Governmental Order; the truth and accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, subject in certain cases to a de minimis, materiality or material adverse effect (each as described in the Merger Agreement) standard; and (ii) the compliance with or performance, in all material respects, of the other party’s covenants and obligations in the Merger Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the consummation of the Merger.
 
The Merger Agreement contained certain termination rights for the Company and Crystal Globe if the Merger was not consummated on or before December 31, 2020.
 
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement dated November 20, 2020, as of December 31, 2020, the Effective Time of the Merger, the 10,000 ordinary shares of common stock of Dynamic Elite issued and outstanding immediately which were held by the Company, were cancelled for $0.045 per share for the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company as Merger Consideration.
 
In January 2021, the Company had received $119,070 from Crystal Globe and distributed proportionately to the Company’s minority shareholders, other than Crystal Globe, which represents 2,646,000 shares of our common stock. Since the remaining 17,408,000 shares of our common stock is owned by Crystal Globe, the $0.045 per share payment for the 17,408,000 shares was offset and Crystal Globe did not receive any cash payment in connection with the Merger.
 
Change in Shell Company Status
 
As a result of the consummation of the Merger, the Company became a shell company as of December 31, 2020.
 
Corporate History
 
Joway Health Industries Group, Inc.
 
We were originally formed as a Texas corporation on March 21, 2003. On October 1, 2010, as a result of a transaction with Dynamic Elite (the “Share Exchange”), Dynamic Elite became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we ceased to be a shell company. Dynamic Elite was the holding company of all the equity of Tianjin Junhe Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Junhe Consulting”). In December 2010, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the State of Texas to the State of Nevada and changed its name to Joway Health Industries Group, Inc. In connection with these changes, the Company adopted new Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
Share Exchange Transaction
 
On October 1, 2010, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Crystal Globe, the sole shareholder of Dynamic Elite International Limited, pursuant to which Crystal Globe transferred all of its shares in Dynamic Elite to us in exchange for 15,215,426 shares of our common stock. As a result, Dynamic Elite became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we ceased to be a shell company, and Crystal Globe held a total of 18,515,426 shares (approximately 92.6%) of our issued and outstanding common stock.
 
The Share Exchange was treated for accounting purposes as a reverse acquisition. Therefore, the Company’s financial statements after the Share Exchange were those of Dynamic Elite and its subsidiaries and controlled companies on a consolidated basis, as if the Share Exchange had been in effect retroactively for all periods presented.

Dynamic Elite
 
Dynamic Elite was founded on June 2, 2010 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands by Crystal Globe and Evan Liu, the sole shareholder of Crystal Globe, at the request of Mr. Jinghe Zhang. Mr. Liu is a friend of Mr. Jinghe Zhang. On September 15, 2010, Dynamic Elite established a wholly-owned subsidiary — Tianjin Junhe Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Junhe Consulting”), as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WOFE) under the laws of the PRC for the purposes of acquiring Tianjin Joway Shengshi Group Co., Ltd. and engaging in the manufacture, distribution and sale of tourmaline products in China. Under Article 6 of the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, adopted April 12, 1986 at the 4th Sess. of the 6th National People’s Congress and as amended on October 31, 2000 (“PRC WOFE Law”) and Article 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation, any person or entity that intends to establish an enterprise in the PRC with foreign capital is required to submit an application for examination and approval to the appropriate department under the State Council. On September 9, 2010, the local Tianjin City government issued a certificate of approval approving the foreign ownership of Junhe Consulting by Dynamic Elite. Mr. Jinghe Zhang was appointed as the Executive Director of Junhe Consulting.
PRC Operating Entities
 
All of our business operations were conducted through our PRC Operating Entities. The chart below sets forth our corporate structure prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020. As of January 1, 2021, as a result of the Merger, we no longer have any subsidiaries.
Joway Shengshi
 
On May 17, 2007, Mr. Jinghe Zhang, Mr. Lijun Si and Mr. Baogang Song founded Tianjin Joway Textile Co., Ltd. as a limited liability company under the PRC law. On November 24, 2009, the company changed its name to Tianjin Joway Shengshi Group Co., Ltd. (“Joway Shengshi”). The registered capital of Joway Shengshi is RMB 50,000,000 and its term of operation will expire on May 16, 2022. Mr. Jinghe Zhang is the Executive Director and General Manager of Joway Shengshi. On July 1, 2010, Mr. Lijun Si transferred 4% of the equity interest in Joway Shengshi to Mr. Jinghe Zhang. As a result, Mr. Zhang owns 99% of the equity interest in Joway Shengshi and Mr. Baogang Song owns the remaining 1% of the equity interest of Joway Shengshi. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Joway Shengshi was the sole shareholder of Joway Technology, Joway Decoration, and Shengtang Trading.

Joway Technology
 
Joway Technology was incorporated under PRC law on March 28, 2007, with a registered capital of RMB 1,100,000. It was formed to engage in intelligent engineering design and construction, development and sales of electronics, water filters, and other similar products. Prior to July 25, 2010, Joway Shengshi held 90.91% of Joway Technology. On July 25, 2010 Joway Shengshi acquired the remaining 9.09% of Joway Technology from Mr. Jingyun Chen for RMB 100,000 in cash. As a result of the acquisition, Joway Shengshi became the sole shareholder of Joway Technology.
Joway Decoration
 
Joway Decoration was cofounded by Joway Shengshi and Mr. Jingyun Chen under PRC law on April 22, 2009, with a registered capital of RMB 2,000,000. It was formed to engage in the business of intelligent electric heating project design and construction, development and sales of electronics technology and water filters, and the manufacture and sales of wood products. Prior to July 9, 2010, Joway Shengshi owned 90% of Joway Decoration. On July 9, 2010, Joway Shengshi entered into a share acquisition agreement with Mr. Jingyun Chen to acquire the remaining 10% of the shares of Joway Decoration for RMB 200,000 in cash. As a result of the acquisition, Joway Shengshi became the sole shareholder of Joway Decoration.
Shengtang Trading
 
Shengtang Trading was cofounded by Joway Shengshi and Mr. Jingyun Chen under PRC law on September 18, 2009, with a registered capital of RMB 2,000,000. It was formed to engage in the business of importing and exporting merchandise and technology; knitwear, biochemistry (excluding toxic chemicals and drugs), and the wholesale and retail sale of hardware. Prior to July 28, 2010, Joway Shengshi owned 95% of Shengtang Trading. On July 28, 2010, Joway Shengshi entered into a share acquisition agreement with Mr. Aiying Wang to acquire the remaining 5% of the shares of Shengtang Trading for RMB 100,000 in cash. As a result of the acquisition, Joway Shengshi became the sole shareholder of Shengtang Trading.
 
VIE Agreements
 
On September 16, 2010, prior to the Share Exchange, Junhe Consulting, Dynamic Elite’s wholly owned subsidiary had entered into a series of control agreements with Joway Shengshi and all of the owners of Joway Shengshi, which agreements allow Junhe Consulting to control Joway Shengshi. Through our ownership of Dynamic Elite, Dynamic Elite’s ownership of Junhe Consulting and Junhe Consulting’s agreements with Joway Shengshi, we believe that Joway Health controls Joway Shengshi and therefore, we consolidate the results of operations of Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries with ours as variable interest entities.
 
In connection with the Share Exchange and as consideration for entering into the VIE Agreements, Mr. Jinghe Zhang and Mr. Baogang Song, the shareholders of Joway Shengshi, entered into a Call Option Agreement with the sole shareholder of Crystal Globe, pursuant to which the shareholders of Joway Shengshi have the right to purchase up to 100% of the shares of Crystal Globe at an aggregate price equal to $20,000 over the next three years. The Call Option vested as to 34% of the shares of Crystal Globe on April 2, 2011, and vests as to 33% on April 2 of 2012 and 2013. As a result, the shareholders of Joway Shengshi became the indirect beneficial owners of the shares of the Company held by Crystal Globe.
 
Under PRC law the acquisition of Joway Shengshi by Junhe Consulting must be structured as a cash transaction with the purchase price based on the appraised value of the equity interest or assets to be sold. Neither Junhe Consulting nor Dynamic Elite had sufficient cash to pay the appraised value of the equity interest or assets of Joway Shengshi. Alternatively, the shareholders of Joway Shengshi entered into a series of contractual agreements (the “VIE Agreements”) which enabled Dynamic Elite to gain control of Joway Shengshi and be entitled to receive 100% of the profits of Joway Shengshi and is obligated for 100% of the losses of Joway Shengshi. As a result of the VIE agreements, we are able to consolidate Joway Shengshi’s financial statements, including the results of operations, assets and liabilities of Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries without triggering the regulatory requirements of PRC law. Under PRC law the VIE Agreements are considered commercial transactions among legal entities and individuals, and do not trigger the PRC requirements that apply to acquisitions, although the pledge by Joway Shengshi’s equity holders of all their equity in Joway Shengshi to Junhe Consulting pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreement (the “Equity Pledge”) must be registered with the appropriate governmental agency. The Equity Pledge was registered with local administration department for industry and commerce pursuant to the Section 1 of Article 226 of PRC Property Law passed by National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007.

Equity Pledge Agreement
 
Under the Equity Pledge Agreement, the Shareholders pledged all of their right, title and interest in their equity interests in Joway Shengshi to Junhe Consulting to guarantee Joway Shengshi’s performance of its obligations under the Consulting Services Agreement. The pledge expired two (2) years after the satisfaction by Joway Shengshi of all of its obligations under the Consulting Services Agreement. During the term of the Equity Pledge Agreement, Junhe Consulting was entitled to vote, control, sell, or dispose of the Pledged Collateral in the event the Company did not perform its obligations under the Consulting Services Agreement. In addition, Junhe Consulting was entitled to collect any and all dividends declared or paid in connection with the Pledged Collateral.
 
Through these contractual arrangements, we had the ability to substantially influence the daily operations and financial affairs of Joway Shengshi and to receive, through our subsidiaries, all of its profits. As a result, we were considered the primary beneficiary of Joway Shengshi and its operations, and Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries were deemed to be our variable interest entities. Accordingly, we were able to consolidate into our financial statements the results, assets and liabilities of Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries.
 
Call Option Agreement
 
As part of the reorganization of Joway Shengshi, Mr. Liu and the shareholders of Joway Shengshi entered into a Call Option Agreement, pursuant to which the shareholders of Joway Shengshi had the right to purchase up to 100% of the shares of Crystal Globe at an aggregate price equal of $20,000 over the next three years. In addition, the Option Agreement also provides that Mr. Liu should not dispose any of the shares of Crystal Globe without consent of Mr. Jinghe Zhang and Mr. Baogang Song. Upon the consummation of the Share Exchange Transaction, Crystal Globe became the principal shareholder of Joway Health (f/k/a G2 Ventures, Inc.) and Mr. Zhang and Mr. Song became indirect beneficial owners of the shares in Joway Health held by Crystal Globe pursuant to this Call Option Agreement.
 
On November 13, 2016, Mr. Jinghe Zhang exercised his Call Option as to 99% of the shares of Crystal Globe and Mr. Baogang Song exercised his Call Option as to 1% of the shares of Crystal Globe. As a result of exercising his Call Option, Mr. Zhang became the controlling shareholder of Crystal Globe and in turn, the controlling shareholder of the Company. On November 20, 2016, Mr. Song transferred his 1% of the shares of Crystal Globe to Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang thus controlled 17,408,000 shares, or 86.81%, of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.
 
As a result of the Merger, we become a shell company on December 31, 2020 and no longer have any subsidiaries.
 
Business Description
 
Prior to the consummation of the Merger, we, through our PRC Operating Entities, were engaged in the manufacture and sales of tourmaline-related healthcare products, and had a total of 21 full time employees.
 
As a result of the consummation of the Merger on December 31, 2020, we became a shell company and as of the date of this Annual Report, we have no full time employees. Starting from January 1, 2021, we have no longer any business operations.
 
Introduction to Tourmaline
 
Tourmaline is a crystal silicate mineral compounded with elements such as aluminum, iron, magnesium, sodium, lithium, or potassium. Tourmaline is classified as a semi-precious stone and the gem comes in a wide variety of colors. (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourmaline)
 
Tourmaline has the ability to become its own source of electric charge, as it is both pyroelectric, as well as piezoelectric. When it is put under pressure or when it is dramatically heated or cooled, tourmaline creates an electrical charge capable of emitting far infrared rays (“FIR”) and negative ions. (Source: http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/tourmaline.html)
 
FIRs are invisible waves of energy capable of penetrating deep into the human body. Negative ions are atoms that have a negative electric charge. FIRs and negative ions are perceived to have certain health benefits. (Source: http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/tourmaline.html)
 
7

 

Because it is a permanent source of FIRs and negative ions, tourmaline is perceived to have certain health benefits (Source: Niwa Institute for Immunology, Japan. Int J. Biometeorol 1993 Sep; 37(3) 133-8). In view of its perceived health benefits, tourmaline has been used to manufacture a wide range of healthcare products, including apparel, bedding, water purifiers, sauna rooms, and personal care products.
 
While tourmaline has perceived health benefits, the actual benefits of tourmaline to human health are unknown. The full efficacy of tourmaline to human health requires further significant clinical study. We are not aware of any formal clinical studies which have validated the health benefits of tourmaline.
 
We purchased liquid tourmaline from domestic Chinese companies which, in turn, imported it from South Korea. Liquid tourmaline is readily available and its price has remained relatively stable. We had not experienced any shortage in tourmaline but as a precaution, we closely monitored its price and have several back-up suppliers until we become a shell company.
 
China’s Tourmaline Health-Related Products Market
 
The use of tourmaline in health-related products in China began in 2001. Although more and more companies are producing tourmaline health-related products every year, the market for these products in China is still in its infancy and highly fragmented. (Source: 2010-2012 China’s tourmaline market and investment prospects research Report, Institute of China Uniway Economics, August, 2010).
 
Currently, there are numerous kinds of tourmaline health-related products on the market, including tourmaline clothes, tourmaline mattresses, tourmaline water machines, etc. In China, users of tourmaline health-related products are typically middle-aged and elderly people and demand for tourmaline health-related products is still relatively low compared to the size of the Chinese population.
 
In 2015, New Material is listed in the state development strategies in the State Council Report by Premier Keqiang Li. Tourmaline is defined as New Material and Tourmaline Processing Technology is designated as New Material Application Technology.
 
We believe that the main challenge for the tourmaline health-related product companies is market development rather than competition. With rising living standards, increasing disposable income, higher health consciousness and the greater awareness of the health benefits of tourmaline, we believe that the tourmaline health products market will grow rapidly in the next few years.
 
Manufacturing Process
 
Prior to the consummation of the Merger, we had two manufacturing processes.
 
One manufacturing process consisted of applying or infusing raw textiles with liquid or granular tourmaline and then producing products from these tourmaline-infused textiles. This process was used to produce Male and Female Underpants, Tourmaline Scarves and Tourmaline Pillowcases.
 
Our second manufacturing process consisted of applying or infusing already finished products with liquid or granular tourmaline. We purchased finished products, such as clothing, bedding, and mattresses and then, using one or more of the techniques described below, coat and/or infuse the products with liquid or granular tourmaline.
 
8

 

We coated or infused liquid or granular tourmaline into our products using one or more of the following methods:
 
The Spray Method
 
We used special high-pressure nozzles to spray liquid tourmaline onto the surface of the product. Through this process, the tourmaline particles were attached onto the surface of the product. We then used a high-temperature ironing machine to embed the tourmaline particles into the fibers of the product. This method is generally used in the manufacture of large pieces of textile products, such as mattresses.
The Dip Method
 
We completely immersed fabrics into liquid tourmaline and then stirred the fabrics in the liquid tourmaline to ensure the tourmaline particles attach to the surface of the fabrics. Finally, we embedded the tourmaline particles into the fibers by applying heat with our special high-temperature ironing machine. This method is used in the manufacture of smaller products, such as underwear, scarves, and shirts.
The Filling Method
 
We filled the products with tourmaline particles. This method is generally used to make activated water machines and other water treatment products.
 
The three methods mentioned above were keys to our manufacturing process. We protected our manufacturing methods via confidentiality agreements entered into between us and our employees. Pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, the employees were prohibited from unlawfully revealing and using our confidential technology during his/her term of employment and ten years after the termination of employment.
Our Products and Services
 
Prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020, we were primarily in the manufacture of the following three series of tourmaline-related healthcare products:
 

1. | Healthcare Knit Goods Series
---+-----------------------------

 
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, reported as part of loss from operations of our discontinued component, our healthcare knit goods series of products accounted for approximately 15.5% and 11.3% of our annual sales revenue, respectively. This series of products was comprised of tourmaline treated mattresses, bed linen, underwear, and shirts. We used either the spray or dip method to embed tourmaline particles into the fabric of this series of products.
 
Set forth below is a list of our major healthcare knit goods products, the trademarks or marks under which they were marketed and the manufacturing method employed prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020:
 

No. | Products | Trademark/Mark | Manufacturing Method
----+-----------------------+----------------+---------------------
1 | Golden Mattress | | | Spray Method
2 | Tourmaline Mattress | | | Spray Method
3 | Tourmaline Underwear | | | Dip Method 
4 | Tourmaline Bed Linens | | | Spray Method
5 | Tourmaline Pillow | | | Spray Method

2. | Daily Healthcare and Personal Care Series
---+------------------------------------------

 
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, reported as part of loss from operations of our discontinued component, our daily healthcare and personal care series of products accounted for approximately 27.9% and 34.7% of our annual sales revenue, respectively. This series was comprised of tourmaline-treated waist protectors, knee protectors, scarves, and shampoo and soap products. We used all three production methods to embed tourmaline particles into these products. We believe these tourmaline-treated daily healthcare products and personal care products produce FIRs and negative ions which have perceived health benefits. This series was also comprised of four edible products without tourmaline treatment, including Xin-Nao-Ling Fish Oil Soft Gel, Zhi-Li-Bao Fish Oil Soft Gel, Glucosamine Chondroitin Sulfate & Calcium Capsule and Vegetable and Fruit Enzyme Juice, which are subject to CFDA regulation.
 
Set forth below is a list of our major products in the daily healthcare and personal care series, the trademarks or marks under which they were marketed and the manufacturing method employed prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020:

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, reported as part of loss from operations of our discontinued component, our wellness house and activated water machine series of products accounted for approximately 56.7% and 54.0% of our annual sales revenue, respectively. This series of products was comprised mainly of tourmaline wellness houses, foot sauna bucket, tourmaline activated water machines and drinking mugs. Our tourmaline wellness house resembled a regular sauna room in which users experienced heat sessions. However, the inner layer of our wellness house were coated with tourmaline, which emits FIRs and negative ions when heated. Tourmaline is perceived to have certain health benefits. We supplied two types of wellness houses: one for family use, which was designed to be installed in the corner of a room and can contain three people; the other was customized and constructed on site for commercial bathrooms or spas according to their specifications. Our tourmaline activated water machines and drinking mugs were infused tourmaline particles into filters. Our Foot Sauna Bucket was filled with tourmaline particles on the bottom.

Franchise Stores
 
Prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020, approximately 88% and 78% of our annual sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were made to our franchisees.
 
As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 49 franchise stores across the PRC that were authorized to sell our products exclusively. Set forth below is a geographical breakdown of the franchise stores:

Region | Number of Franchise Stores | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+---

Total | | 49

 
We used multiple criteria to select our franchisees, including financial condition, sales network, sales personnel, and facilities.

We typically entered into a standard franchising agreement with the applicant. Pursuant to the agreement, the franchisee was authorized to sell our products exclusively at a predetermined retail price. In exchange, we provided them with products at a discounted price, geographical exclusivity, and marketing, training and technological support. The franchisee was also required to adhere to certain standards of product merchandising, promotion and presentment. No initial franchise fees were required from the franchisee, nor was the franchisee required to pay any continuing royalties. The agreement was generally for a term of three years and was renewable on the mutual agreement of both parties.
 
After the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020, we have no franchise stores across the PRC.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020, our primary marketing strategies were directed towards both our franchisees and end users, and the marketing efforts of our franchisees were directed towards end users. We assisted franchisees on monthly product introduction seminars, which were open to both our franchisees and to the general public.
 
The franchise stores were responsible for the cost of organizing the monthly product introduction seminars and meetings and we were responsible for the travel expenses of our employees who attended these meetings and seminars to explain and promote our various product lines. There were on average 3 such seminars and meetings each month nationwide in 2019. Generally, we chose the venue for the product seminars and meetings based on market prospects, sales volume and the extent of meeting preparation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not hold a product seminar and meeting due to the COVID-19.
 
Below is a breakdown of our marketing expenses in the fiscal years 2020 and 2019.

Seasonality

Competition
 
Competitive Environment
 
China’s tourmaline health products market is highly segmented and is in the stage with great demand.
 
However, given the highly segmented nature of the market, we are unable to locate any information on the size of the tourmaline healthcare-related market in China. Currently, Japanese and Korean companies are leaders in tourmaline technology. However, they have not yet developed a sizeable market share for their products in the PRC (Source: 2010-2012 China’s tourmaline market and investment prospects research Report, Institute of China Uniway Economics, August 2010). Therefore, we believe that there is a great opportunity for us to create demand and market share and establish ourselves as a leader in the tourmaline-related healthcare products field.
Our Competitors
 
Our major competitors in the PRC were as follows prior to the consummation of the Merger, effective as of December 31, 2020:
 

● | Hanya Nano Technology Co., Ltd. operates in Changsha, Hunan province, PRC. They mainly focus on manufacturing tourmaline sauna rooms and tourmaline health products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Harbin Handu Tourmaline Nano Technology Development Co., Ltd. operates in PRC. They mainly focus on manufacturing tourmaline sauna rooms and tourmaline health products.

Our Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that by leveraging the following strengths, we can effectively compete and enhance our market position:
 

● | Brand Advantage: We are one of the first companies to manufacture, distribute and sell tourmaline health-related products in the PRC and we believe that our trademark, “Joway”, is the most established and well-known brand in the market. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Technology Advantage: We possess several patents for tourmaline health-related products. We also invest a significant amount of time and expense in new product research and development. In 2016, we applied for a new patent on tourmaline after researching with Tianjin University of Technology. In addition, we have 3 types of products put on record of the Class 1 Medical devices in Tianjin Market and Quality Supervision and Administration Commission which lay a foundation of making health care products listed in Tianjin catalogue of medical system.
● | Product Diversification Advantage: Most of our competitors concentrate on the one of the tourmaline segments. On the contrary, our products cover diversified tourmaline related catalogue such as tourmaline daily health-related products, water treatment products and tourmaline home accessories. 


● | Sales Channels Advantage: As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 49 franchise stores in most of the big cities in the PRC and we continue to expand our franchise network. We believe our extensive franchisee network will assure that our sales continue to grow. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Talent Advantage: We have recruited additional employees in the fields of marketing, franchise and training, who have several years of relevant experience in their previous careers. We plan to focus the efforts of these individuals to enhance our marketing and sales. 
● | Public Relation Advantage: We enjoy the benefits of a membership at China Health Care Association and China Home Textile Association. For example, as a member, we are entitled to obtain the fist-hand technology related to tourmaline and apply such technology to our business when necessary.

Insurance
 
We do not carry property insurance on our buildings, facilities, and major operating assets, but on our vehicles, and we do not have any business interruption insurance due to the limited availability of this type of coverage in the PRC. During 2020 and 2019, we had no product liability claims.
Employees
 
Prior to the consummation of the Merger as of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 21 full time employees. After the consummation of the Merger, we have no full time employees.
 
There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
 
We are required to contribute a portion of our employees’ total salaries to the PRC government’s social insurance funds, including pension insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance, and maternity insurance, in accordance with relevant regulations. We have purchased work injury insurance and medical insurance for all our employees.
 
Effective January 1, 2008, the PRC introduced a new labor contract law that enhances rights for the nation’s workers, including open-ended work contracts and severance pay. The legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary laborers and makes it harder to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with fixed-term contracts be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after a fixed-term contract is renewed twice. Although the new labor contract law will increase our labor costs, we do not anticipate there will be any significantly effects on our overall profitability in the near future since such amount was historically not material to our operating cost. Management anticipates this may be a step toward improving candidate retention for skilled workers.
