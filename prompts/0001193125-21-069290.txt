ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Corporate Information 
 Salem is a domestic multimedia company specializing in Christian and conservative content, with media properties comprising radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing. Our content is intended for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk. Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available under the Investor Relations section of our website at www.salemmedia.com. Any information found our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference into this or any report of Salem filed with or furnished to the SEC. 
 We have three operating segments: (1) Broadcast, (2) Digital Media, and (3) Publishing, which also qualify as reportable segments. Our operating segments reflect how our chief operating decision makers, which we define as a collective group of senior executives, assess the performance of each operating segment and determine the appropriate allocations of resources to each segment. We continually review our operating segment classifications to align with operational changes in our business and may make changes as necessary. 
 We measure and evaluate our operating segments based on operating income and operating expenses that do not include allocations of costs related to corporate functions, such as accounting and finance, human resources, legal, tax and treasury, which are reported as unallocated corporate expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in this annual report. We also exclude costs such as amortization, depreciation, taxes and interest expense when evaluating the performance of our operating segments. 
 Business Strategy 
 We are fundamentally committed to programming and content emphasizing Christian values, conservative family themes and news. Our commitment to these values means that we may choose not to switch to other formats or pursue potentially more profitable business opportunities in response to changes in audience preferences. 
 Our goal is to produce and deliver compelling content to audiences interested in Christian and family-themed programming and conservative news talk and to be considered the market leader in these segments for all audiences, programmers and advertisers. Our integrated multimedia platform includes traditional media, such as radio broadcasting, book publishing and print magazines, as well as emerging forms of media, such as websites, podcasts, mobile applications and digital publications. We pursue the ongoing expansion of our media platform as the marketplace evolves while aggressively managing operating costs and cash flows. Expansion opportunities include increasing the strength and reach of our broadcast signals, providing state-of-the-art broadcast and digital marketing services to our customers, investing in and building our websites, mobile and tablet applications, promoting our authors and on-air talent, and increasing the distribution and page views for our print and digital content. Our national presence in each of these mediums provides advertisers and programmers with a powerful and integrated platform to reach audiences throughout the United States without compromising the sense of community involvement and branding that we generate through local events and promotions. 
Broadcasting 
 Our foundational business is the ownership and operation of radio stations in large metropolitan markets. We assemble market clusters, or multiple radio stations operating within the same geographic market, to achieve operational efficiencies. Several benefits are achievable when operating market clusters. First, we can offer advertisers and programmers access to multiple audiences by providing airtime on each radio station in that market. Second, we realize cost and operating efficiencies by consolidating sales, technical and administrative support, promotional functions and other shared overhead costs, such as facilities and rent, when possible. Third, the addition of new radio stations in existing markets allows us to leverage our hands-on knowledge of that market to increase our appeal to new audiences and advertisers.

 Our broadcast operating segment creates and distributes programming content though our radio stations and our networks, including our national and local on-air hosts. Broadcasting also includes our media strategists, our national advertising sales firm, and Salem Surround, our multimedia advertising agency specializing in digital product offerings. 
 Digital Media 
 The Internet, smartphones and tablets continue to change the way in which content and advertisements are delivered to audiences. Continual advancements with online search engines, social media and mobile applications provide consumers with numerous methods to locate specific content and information online. Digital tools allow us to effectively deliver our content and to provide strategic marketing services to our customers. Our editorial staff, including our on-air personalities, provide digital commentaries, programs, text, audio and video content that we believe to be knowledge-based, credible and reliable. We make strategic decisions to invest in website development, mobile applications and tablet applications given the ongoing shift in consumer demand. We continually seek opportunities to diversify our digital traffic sources to avoid reliance on any one provider. We offer custom digital product offerings, including tools for metasearch, retargeting, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. 
Publishing 
 Print books and eBooks provide a distribution network for audiences interested in Christian and family-themed content as well as conservative news and opinion. Our strategy to attract highly sought-after authors and high-profile Christian commentators expands our presence in the conservative and Christian media market and increases the likelihood of printing books that appear on the best-seller lists. 
Seasonality 
 Our results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As is typical in the broadcasting industry, our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue typically exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue. Seasonal fluctuations in advertising revenue correspond with quarterly fluctuations in the retail industry. Additionally, we experience increased demand for political advertising during election, or even numbered years, over non-election, or odd numbered years. Political advertising revenue varies based on the number and type of candidates as well as the number and type of debated issues. We also experience fluctuations in quarter-over-quarter comparisons based on the date on which the Easter holiday is observed, as this holiday generates a higher volume of product downloads from our church product websites. 
Audience Growth 
 Our success depends on our ability to reach a growing audience. We seek audience growth opportunities by increasing the strength and number of our broadcast signals, increasing product offerings through digital marketing services, increasing the number of page-views through our digital media platform, increasing book sales, and increasing the subscriber base for our digital content and print magazine. 
 Our audience growth is also contingent upon the desirability of our content to our audience. We produce and provide content that we believe is both compelling and of high commercial value. We rely on a combination of research, market testing and our understanding of our audience to target promotions and events that create visibility and brand awareness in each of our local markets. For maximum results, we cross-promote our content on each of our media platforms. By maximizing our audience share, we achieve growth in ratings, growth in page views and growth in subscribers that we believe can be converted into revenue from programmers and advertisers that are interested in reaching our audience. 
 Media Strategists 
 We have assembled an effective, highly trained sales staff that is responsible for converting our audience into revenue. Media strategists are trained to provide integrated marketing strategies that includes all of our media 
 
3 


  platforms and our full-service digital marketing agency. We operate a focused, sales-oriented culture that rewards selling efforts through a commission and bonus compensation structure. Our media strategists create custom advertising campaigns and provide comprehensive solutions to our clients. Campaigns may include specific geographic coverage areas, event sponsorships, special promotions, e-mail sponsorships, print advertisements, and various digital media elements, including banner advertisements, site retargeting, search engine marketing, tools for metasearch, website design, reputation management, online listing services, and social media marketing. 
 Significant Community Involvement 
 We expect our public image to reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic groups that we serve. We regularly collaborate with organizations that serve Christian, conservative, and family-themed audiences as well as sponsor and support events that are important to this group. We believe that our ongoing active involvement and our strong relationships within Christian and conservative communities provide us with a unique competitive advantage that significantly improves the marketability of our media platform to advertisers and programmers targeting such communities. We produce and sponsor a number of local events that we believe are important in building our brand identity. Our sponsored events include listener rallies, speaking tours, pastor appreciation events and concerts such as our Fishfest® concerts. Local events such as these connect us with our audience and enable us to create an enhanced awareness and name recognition in each of our markets. We believe that this brand awareness creates loyalty with our audience and increases our audience share and ratings over time. 
Corporate Structure 
 Management of our operations is largely decentralized with operational vice presidents and general managers located throughout the United States. We believe that this decentralization encourages each general manager and vice president to apply innovative techniques for improving and growing their operations locally in ways that may become transferable to benefit other markets and operations. 
 Our broadcast operations vice presidents, some of whom are also station general managers, are experienced radio broadcasters with expertise in sales, programming, marketing and production. Each of our broadcast operations vice presidents oversees several markets on a regional basis. Our digital and publishing operations vice presidents and general managers are also located throughout the United States at various locations in which we operate. 
 All our locations receive executive leadership and oversight from our corporate staff. Corporate staff members have experience and expertise in, among other things, accounting and finance, treasury, risk management, insurance, information technology, human resources, legal, engineering, real estate, strategic direction and other support functions designed to provide resources to local management. Corporate staff also oversee the placement and rate negotiations for national block programming on our stations. Centralized oversight of national programming is necessary because many of our key programming partners purchase times in multiple radio markets. 
 Human Capital 
 As of February 11, 2021, we employed 1,338 total employees of which 1,076 were full time and 262 were part time. These employees consisted of 913 in broadcasting, 149 in digital media, 103 in publishing, and 173 corporate employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The average tenure for all of our employees is 8 years. 
 We employ on-air personalities and we may enter into employment agreements with these on-air personalities in order to protect our interests in these relationships. However, on-air talent may be lost to competitors for a variety of reasons. While we do not believe that the loss of any one of our on-air personalities would adversely affect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations, the loss of several key on-air personalities combined could adversely affect on our business.

 Our success depends on the continued contributions from our employees and senior management team. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. The Nominating and Governance committee of our Board of Directors (Board) discusses succession planning annually. The loss of any of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. 
 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The responses by federal, state and local governments to restrict public gatherings and travel rapidly grew to include stay-at-home orders, school closures and mandatory restrictions on non-essential businesses and services that has adversely affected workforces, certain economies, and financial markets resulting in a significant economic downturn. We experienced declining revenue from advertising, programming, events and book sales. Several advertisers reduced or ceased advertising spend due to the outbreak and stay-at-home orders that effectively shut many businesses down. This was particularly true within our broadcast segment, which derives substantial revenue from local advertisers who have been particularly hard hit due to social distancing and government interventions and in our publishing segment that sells books in retail stores and through live events. 
 While this disruption is expected to be temporary, there remains to be considerable uncertainty around the duration. Although advertising revenue continues to improve from the lowest levels experienced during April and May of 2020, it remains significantly below prior years. The exact timing and pace of the recovery has not been determinable as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, resulting in varying degrees of reinstated stay-at-home orders. Due to continuing uncertainties regarding the ultimate scope and trajectory of COVID-19s spread and evolution, it is impossible to predict the total impact that the pandemic will have on our business. If public and private entities continue to enforce restrictive measures, the material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could persist. Our businesses could also continue to be impacted by the disruptions from COVID-19 and resulting adverse changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior. 
 Future availability under our credit facility is contingent upon our eligible receivable balance, which is negatively impacted by lower revenue and longer days to collect. Availability under our Asset Based Loan Facility (ABL Facility) is subject to a borrowing base consisting of (a) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable plus (b) a calculated amount based on the value of certain real property. The maximum amount available under our ABL Facility declined to $24.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $26.4 million at December 31, 2019, of which $5.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020 compared to $12.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2019. 
 In response to these developments, beginning in March 2020, we implemented several measures to reduce costs and conserve cash to ensure that we have adequate cash to meet our debt servicing requirements, including: 
 

 | limiting capital expenditures;
--+-------------------------------


 | reducing discretionary spending, including travel and entertainment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | eliminating open positions and freezing new hires;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | reducing staffing levels;
--+--------------------------


 | implementing temporary company-wide pay cuts of 5%, 7.5% or 10% depending on salary level;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | furloughing certain employees;
--+-------------------------------


 | temporarily suspending the company 401(k) match;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | requesting rent concessions from landlords;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | requesting discounts from vendors;
--+-----------------------------------

 | offering early payment discounts to certain customers in exchange for advance cash payments; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | suspending the payment of distributions on our common stock indefinitely.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) was signed into law. The CARES Act provides opportunities for additional liquidity, loan guarantees, and other government programs to support companies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and their employees. On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) that includes a second relief package, which, among other things, provides for an extension of the Payroll Support Program established by the CARES Act. We have utilized certain benefits of the CARES Act, and we may be entitled to benefits under the CAA based on our individual locations, including: 
 

 | the deferral of all employer FICA taxes beginning in April 2020 for the remainder of 2020, with 50% payable in December 2021 and the remainder payable in December 2022;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | relaxation of interest expense deduction limitation for income tax purposes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Payroll Protection Plan (PPP) loans available based on the eligibility determined on a per-location basis of up to $11.2 million on a consolidated basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our customers have benefited from the enhanced benefits provided by the CARES Act, and that they will also benefit from the CAA. The CAA provides for another round of direct payments, enhanced unemployment benefits, education funding, and aid to sectors still reeling from the economic fallout of the pandemic. While these measures may benefit many of our customers, we cannot assure you that the implementation of these measures will offset the negative impact of COVID-19 on our customers. If the CAA or any additional stimulus measures are not sufficient to remediate the financial stress on our customers as a result of the pandemic, we may experience ongoing challenges in growing and maintain revenue and we may experience an increase in delinquencies that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods. 
 We continue to review and consider any available potential benefit under the CARES Act and the CAA for which we qualify. We cannot predict the manner in which such benefits or any of the other benefits described herein will be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you that we will be able to access such benefits in a timely manner or at all. If the U.S. government or any other governmental authority agrees to provide such aid under the CARES Act, the CAA, or any other crisis relief assistance it may impose certain requirements on the recipients of the aid, including restrictions on executive officer compensation, dividends, prepayment of debt, limitations on debt and other similar restrictions that may apply for a period of time after the aid is repaid or redeemed in full. 
 Due to the adverse economic impact, we reforecast our anticipated results extending through March 2022. Our reforecast includes the impact of certain of these cost-cutting measures. Based on our current and expected economic outlook and our current and expected funding needs, we believe that the borrowing capacity under our current credit facilities, together with cash on hand, allows us to meet our ongoing operating requirements, fund necessary capital expenditures and satisfy our debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months, including the working capital deficit at December 31, 2020. Based on our current assessment, we believe that we have the ability to meet our obligations as they come due for one year from the issuance of this annual report. 
 Recent Developments 
 Cyber Incident 
 On August 7, 2020, we detected a ransomware attack impacting certain of our operational and information technology systems. We promptly launched an investigation, notified law enforcement and engaged the services of specialized incident response professionals. We have recovered our business systems and critical operational 
 
6 


  data. Based on our investigation, we believe the incident has not had a material impact on our business, operations or financial condition. We believe that our cyber insurance coverage is commensurate with our size and the nature of our operations. 
 Debt Transactions 
 On October 20, 2020, we entered into a fourth amendment to our ABL Facility that provides a one-time waiver with respect to the current covenant testing period allowing the covenant trigger event date to be the first day after the availability on the ABL Facility had equaled or exceeded (1) 15% of the maximum revolver amount and (2) $4.5 million and a waiver permitting our July 2020 financial statements to be issued on or before September 30, 2020 due to delays that were caused by a ransomware attack. 
 On April 7, 2020, we entered into a third amendment to ABL Facility that increased the advance rate on eligible accounts receivable from 85% to 90% and extended the maturity date from May 19, 2022 to March 1, 2024. The April 7, 2020 amendment also allows for an alternative benchmark rate that may include SOFR due to LIBOR being scheduled to be discontinued at the end of calendar year 2021. 
 During January 2020 we completed repurchases of $3.5 million of the 6.75% Senior Secured Notes (Notes) for $3.4 million in cash, recognizing a net gain of $49,000 after adjusting for bond issuance costs as detailed in Note 12 Long-Term Debt of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Equity Transactions 
 Distributions of $0.7 million ($0.025 per share) were declared and paid in March 2020 based upon our Board of Directors (Board) then current assessment of our business as detailed in Note 19  Equity Transactions of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Acquisitions 
 On September 15, 2020, we acquired the Hyper Pixels Media website and related assets for $1.1 million in cash. We paid $0.4 million in cash upon closing with deferred payments of $0.4 million due January 31, 2021 and $0.3 million due September 15, 2021. We recorded goodwill of approximately $0.1 million associated with the expected synergies to be realized upon combining the operations into our digital media platform within Salem Web Network (SWN) and from brand loyalty from Hyper Pixel Medias existing subscriber base that is not a separately identifiable intangible asset. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations reflects the operating results of this entity as of the closing date within our digital media segment. 
Divestitures 
 On April 6, 2020, we sold radio station WBZW-AM and an FM translator construction permit in Orlando, Florida, for $0.2 million in cash. We recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2019, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets less the estimated closing costs. 
Pending Transactions 
 On September 10, 2020, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) to sell radio station WKAT-AM and an FM translator in Miami, Florida, for $3.5 million in cash. We will exit the Miami market upon the close of this transaction. We entered a Local Marketing Agreement (LMA) under which the buyer will begin programming the station in November 2020. We recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.4 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2020, which reflects the sale price as compared to the carrying value of the assets sold, the estimated closing costs, and the write-off of the remaining Miami assets as a result of exiting this market. This transaction is subject to the approval of the FCC and is expected to close during the first half of 2021.

 On February 5, 2020, we entered an APA with Word Broadcasting to sell radio stations WFIA-AM, WFIA-FM and WGTK-AM in Louisville, Kentucky for $4.0 million with credits applied from amounts previously paid, including a portion of the monthly fees paid under a Time Brokerage Agreement (TBA.) Due to changes in debt markets, the transaction was not funded, and it is uncertain when, or if, the transaction will close. Word Broadcasting continues to program the stations under a TBA that began in January 2017. 
 Broadcasting 
 Our broadcast segment includes the operating results of our radio stations, broadcast networks, and our national sales agencies including our full-service digital agency, Salem Surround. National companies often prefer to advertise across the United States as an efficient and cost-effective way to reach their target audiences. Our national platform under which we offer radio airtime, digital campaigns and print advertisements can benefit national companies by reaching audiences throughout the United States. 
Radio Stations 
 We own and/or operate 99 radio stations in 35 markets, including 58 radio stations in 23 of the top 25 markets, consisting of 33 FM radio stations and 66 AM radio stations. We also program the Family Talk® Christian-themed talk format station on SiriusXM Channel 131. We are one of only three commercial radio broadcasters with radio stations in all the top 10 markets. We are the sixth largest commercial radio broadcaster in the United States as measured by number of radio stations overall and the third largest operator as measured by number of stations in the top 25 markets. 
 We program our radio stations in three main formats: (1) Christian Teaching and Talk, (2) News Talk and (3) Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). Other radio station formats include Spanish language Christian Teaching and Talk, Business, Country, Urban, and Classic Hits. 
 Christian Teaching and Talk. We currently program 37 of our radio stations in our foundational format, Christian Teaching and Talk, which is talk programming emphasizing Christian and family themes. Through this format, a listener can hear Bible teachings and sermons, as well as gain insight to questions related to daily life, such as raising children or religious legal rights in education and in the workplace. This format uses block programming time to offer a learning resource and a source of personal support for listeners. Listeners often contact our programmers to donate, ask questions and obtain materials on a subject matter or receive study guides based on what they have learned on the radio. 
 Block Programming. We recognize revenue from the sale of blocks of airtime to program producers that typically consist of 121/2, 25 or 50-minutes of time. We sell blocks of airtime on our Christian Teaching and Talk format stations to a variety of national and local religious and charitable organizations that we believe create compelling radio programs. National programmers, such as established non-profit religious and educational organizations, typically purchase time on a Monday through Friday basis with supplemental programming blocks available for weekend release. Local programmers, such as community churches and organizations, typically purchase blocks for weekend releases. Historically, more than 95% of these national religious and charitable organizations renew their annual programming relationships with us. Based on our historical renewal rates, we believe that block programming provides a steady and consistent source of revenue and cash flows. Our top ten programmers have remained relatively constant and average more than 30 years on-air with us. Over the last five years, block-programming has generated 40% to 43% of our total net broadcast revenue. 
 Satellite Radio. We program SiriusXM Channel 131, the exclusive Christian Teaching and Talk channel on SiriusXM, reaching the entire nation 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   News Talk. We currently program 32 of our radio stations in a News Talk format. Our research shows that our News Talk format is highly complementary to our core Christian Teaching and Talk format. As programmed by Salem, both formats express conservative views and family values. Our News Talk 
 
8 


  format allows us to leverage syndicated talk programming produced by Salem Radio NetworkTM (SRNTM) to radio stations throughout the United States. Syndication of our programs allows us to reach audiences in markets in which we do not own or operate radio stations. 
 Contemporary Christian Music. We currently program 12 of our radio stations in a Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) format, branded The FISH® in most markets. Through the CCM format, we bring listeners the words of inspirational recording artists, set to upbeat contemporary music. Our music format, branded Safe for the Whole Family, features sounds and lyrics that listeners of all ages can enjoy and appreciate. The CCM genre continues to be popular. We believe that the listener base for CCM is underserved in terms of radio coverage, particularly in larger markets, and that our stations fill an otherwise void area in listener choices.

 Broadcast revenue includes radio advertising spots, programming revenue, digital revenue from each of our radio station websites, digital email blasts, Salem Surround revenue, event revenue, and network advertising revenue. The principal source of network broadcast revenue is from the sale of spot advertising time. Salem Consumer Products, our e-commerce site, generates broadcast revenue from the sale of host content materials. 
 We recognize advertising revenue from radio stations as the spots air or are delivered. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 22.1% of our net broadcast revenue, or $39.4 million, from the sale of local spot advertising and 8.6% of our net broadcast revenue, or $15.3 million, from the sale of national spot advertising. 
 We recognize programming revenue as the programs air. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 26.4% and 13.6% of our net broadcast revenue, or $47.0 million and $24.3 million, respectively, from the sale of national and local block programming time, respectively. National program revenue is primarily generated from geographically diverse, well-established non-profit religious and educational organizations that purchase time on our stations in a large number of markets in the United States. National program producers typically purchase 121/2, 25 or 50-minute blocks of time on a Monday through Friday basis and may offer supplemental

  programming for weekend release. We generate local program revenue from community organizations and churches that typically purchase blocks for weekend releases and from local speakers who generally purchase daily releases. Our strategy is to identify and assist quality local programs to expand into national syndication.

 Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive broadcast and media business. We compete for audiences, advertisers and programmers with other radio broadcasters, broadcast and cable television operators, newspapers and magazines, book publishers, national and local digital services, outdoor advertising, direct mail, online marketing and media companies, social media platforms, web-based blogs, and mobile devices. 
 BROADCASTING. Our broadcast audience ratings and market shares are subject to change, and any change in a particular market could adversely affect the revenue of our stations located in that market. While we already compete in some of our markets with stations that offer similar formats, if another radio station were to convert its programming to a format similar to one of ours, or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations, our stations could suffer reduced ratings and/or reduced revenue. In these circumstances, we could also incur significantly higher promotional and other related expenses. We cannot assure that our stations will maintain or increase their current audience ratings and revenue. 
 We compete for advertising revenue with other commercial religious format stations as well as general format radio stations. Our competition for advertising dollars includes other radio stations as well as digital websites and social media, broadcast television, cable television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and billboard advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies. Several factors can materially affect competitive advantage, including, but not limited to, audience ratings, program content, management talent and expertise, sales talent and experience, audience characteristics, signal strength, and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the same market. 
 
16 


 Christian and Family-Themed Radio. The segment of this industry that focuses on Christian and family themes is also a highly competitive business. The financial success of each of our radio stations that focuses on Christian Teaching and Talk is dependent, to a significant degree, upon its ability to generate revenue from the sale of block program time to national and local religious and educational organizations. We compete for this program revenue with a number of different commercial and non-commercial radio station licensees. While we believe that no commercial group owner in the United States specializing in Christian and family-themed programming approaches Salem in size of potential listening audience and presence in major markets, other religious radio stations exist and enjoy varying degrees of prominence and success in each of our markets. 
 New Methods of Content Delivery. Competition also comes from new media technologies and services. These include delivery of audio programming by cable television and satellite systems, digital audio radio services, mobile devices including smart phone applications for iPhone® and Android®, personal communications services, social media, and the service of low powered, limited coverage FM radio stations authorized by the FCC. The delivery of live and stored audio programming through the Internet has also created new competition. In addition, satellite delivered digital audio radio, which delivers multiple audio programming formats to national audiences, has created competition. We have attempted to address these existing and potential competitive threats through a more active strategy to acquire and integrate new electronic communications formats including digital acquisitions, the launch of Salem Surround, and our exclusive arrangement to provide Christian and family-themed talk on SiriusXM, a satellite digital audio radio service. 
 NETWORK. SRNTM competes with other commercial radio networks that offer news and talk programming to religious and general format stations and noncommercial networks that offer Christian music formats. SRNTM also competes with other radio networks for the services of talk show personalities. 
 DIGITAL MEDIA. SWN and Townhall Media compete for visitors and advertisers with other companies that deliver online audio programming, that deliver Christian and conservative digital content, and providers of general market websites and social media. The online media and distribution business changes quickly and is highly competitive. We compete to attract and maintain interactions with advertisers, consumers, content creators and web publishers. Salem Church Products competes for customers with other online sites that offer resources useful in ministries, preaching, teaching and for employment within the Christian community. 
 PUBLISHING. Regnery® Publishing competes with other book publishers for readers and book sales as well as competes for product quality, customer service, suitability of format and subject matter, author reputation, price, timely availability of both new titles and revisions of existing books, digital availability of published products, and timely delivery of products to customers. Our print magazine competes for readers and advertisers with other print publications, including those geared toward Christian audiences. Salem Author Services competes for authors with other on-demand publishers including those focused exclusively on Christian book publishers. 
 Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 
 Introduction. The ownership, operation and sale of broadcast stations, including those licensed to Salem, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority derived from The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the Communications Act). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines whether to approve certain changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission facilities, including power employed, antenna and tower heights, and location of transmission facilities; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act. 
 
17 


 The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of short (less than the maximum) license renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of a license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and the public notices and rulings of the FCC. 
 License Grant and Renewal. Radio broadcast licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years. Licenses must be renewed through an application to the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC will renew a broadcast license if it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity, that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC, and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. 
 From time to time, the renewal of certain licenses may be delayed. We continue to operate these radio stations under their existing licenses until the licenses are renewed. The affected stations are authorized to continue operations until the FCC acts upon the renewal applications. We continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements that are necessary for the FCC renewal. We are currently in the midst of the FCCs radio renewal cycle, and license renewal applications for certain of our stations will be pending during the course of the renewal cycle. We expect all of our broadcast licenses to be renewed by its conclusion. 
 Petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by certain interested parties, including members of the public in a stations market. Such petitions may raise various issues before the FCC. The FCC is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the FCC is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises a substantial and material question of fact as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity. In addition, during certain periods when a renewal application is pending, the transferability of the applicants license is restricted. 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we hold the license. Stations that we operate under an LMA or TBA are not reflected on this table. A broadcast stations market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio stations transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) of the radio stations antenna and the Height Above Average Terrain (HAAT) of the radio stations antenna.

(1) | Radio station KNTS-AM is an expanded band station paired with station KLFE-AM in the Seattle, WA market, and station KBJD-AM is an expanded band station paired with KRKS-AM in the Denver, CO market. We are operating these four stations pursuant to FCC licenses or other FCC authority pending resolution by the FCC of the issue of AM expanded band dual operating authority. Depending upon how the FCC resolves that issue, it is possible that we will be required to surrender one station license in each station pair. Except for these stations, we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the timely renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, although there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed.

(1) | FCC Renewal pending
----+--------------------

 Ownership Matters. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to assign, transfer, grant or renew a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests therein, and compliance with the Communications Acts limitation on alien ownership, as well as compliance with other FCC policies, including equal employment opportunity requirements. 
 
21 


 FCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as attributable interests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations. and other specified mass media entities. Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) officers and directors of a licensee and of its direct and indirect parents; (2) general partners; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly insulated from management activities; (4) a 5% or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a corporate licensee or parent, except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, the attribution threshold is a 20% or more voting stock interest; and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33% of a licensees total asset value, if the interest holder provides over 15% of the licensee stations total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-service (radio or television) broadcast or newspaper interest in the same market (the EDP Rule). An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time or sells more than 15% per week of the advertising time on a radio station in the same market is generally deemed to have an attributable interest in that station. Debt instruments, non-voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited partnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule. 
 The FCC ownership rules relevant to our business are summarized below. Because of these rules, a purchaser of voting stock of the company that acquires an attributable interest in the company may violate the FCCs rule if it also has an attributable interest in another radio station, depending on the number and location of those radio stations. Such a purchaser also may be restricted in the other companies in which it may invest, to the extent that these investments give rise to an attributable interest. If an attributable stockholder of the company violates any of these ownership rules, the company may be unable to obtain from the FCC one or more authorizations needed to conduct its radio station business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions. 
 Foreign Ownership: Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by a corporation that has more than one-fifth of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. Under the Communications Act, there are limitations on the licensee of a broadcast license, that is held by any corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by any other corporation more than one-fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships. We therefore may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted by aliens, foreign governments or non-U.S. corporations, although the FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcasting holding companies. The FCC generally will not make such a determination absent favorable executive branch review. 
 Local Radio Ownership: The maximum allowable number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the size of the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same radio service (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50% of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour-overlap methodology where they do not exist. An FCC rulemaking is pending to determine how to define radio markets for stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. 
 The FCC also restricts the number of television stations an entity may own both in local markets and nationwide. 
 
22 


 Our current ownership of radio broadcast stations complies with the FCCs multiple ownership rules; however, these rules may limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in certain of our markets. 
 Cross-Ownership: The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits an individual or entity from having an attributable interest in either a radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same market, subject to certain exceptions and with waivers available in particular cases. The radio/television cross-ownership rule limits common ownership of television stations and same market radio stations. In general, an individual or entity may hold attributable interests in one television station and up to seven same-market radio stations (or two television stations and up to six same-market radio stations), depending on the number of independently owned radio, television and other specified media voices in the market. 
 Review of Media Ownership Rules: The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules on a quadrennial basis (i.e., every four years) and to repeal or modify any of its rules that are no longer necessary in the public interest. Despite several such reviews and appellate remands, the FCCs rules limiting the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a local market have remained largely intact since their initial adoption following the 1996 Act. The FCCs previous ownership reviews have been subject to litigation. 
 In November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a decision that resulted in reinstatement of the cross-ownership rules, which the FCC had previously eliminated. The Supreme Court of the United States granted petitions for certiorari seeking review of the Third Circuit decision and heard argument on January 19, 2021. The case remains pending. The FCC initiated its 2018 quadrennial review in December 2018 and that proceeding remains pending. Among other things, the FCC is seeking comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rules implementation and whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest. We cannot predict whether the appeal or forthcoming review proceeding will result in modifications of the ownership rules or the impact (if any) that such modifications would have on our business. 
 Federal Antitrust Considerations. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), which evaluate transactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws, are also active in their review of radio station acquisitions, particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets. 
 For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act (HSR Act) and the rules promulgated thereunder require the parties to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws, as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or other assets of the company. The FTC or the DOJ may investigate acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws. The DOJ also has stated publicly that it believes that LMAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. 
 We can provide no assurances that our acquisition strategy will not be adversely affected in any material respect by antitrust reviews. 
 Geographic Financial Information 
 Our customers are based in various locations throughout the United States. While no one customer currently accounts for 10% or more of our total revenue individually or in the aggregate, our broadcast operating segment is particularly dependent on revenue generated from our Los Angeles and Dallas broadcast markets. Our Los 
 
23 


  Angeles radio stations generated 10.6% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 11.6% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Dallas radio stations generated 9.3% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 10.1% of our total net broadcasting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
 Because substantial portions of our broadcast revenue is derived from our Los Angeles and Dallas markets, our ability to generate revenue in those markets could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns in these areas.
