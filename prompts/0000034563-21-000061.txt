Business Strategy
Overview
We are a coffee company dedicated to delivering the coffee people want, the way they want it. We build partnerships with customers who value service, quality, and sustainable sourcing and are passionate about delivering great coffee, tea, and culinary experiences to their communities.
In order to achieve our mission, we have grown existing capabilities and continue to develop new capabilities to deliver value to our customers. More recently, we have undertaken initiatives such as, but not limited to, the following:
•Executing Manufacturing and Network Optimization. In fiscal 2021, we substantially increased the production and packaging capacity at our Northlake, Texas production facility which allowed us to exit our aged Houston, Texas facility. We also opened a new distribution center in Rialto, California, which is geographically closer to many of our customers in the Western United States which enabled more efficient service to our West Coast network as well as the consolidation of certain branches in Southern California. We have also executed branch rationalization in other markets in fiscal year 2021, which improves our cost structure without sacrificing service to our customers. For upcoming fiscal year 2022, we continue to be focused on leveraging our investment in the Northlake, Texas, facility to improve production efficiencies and rebalancing volume across our manufacturing and distribution networks to facilitate sustainable long-term growth.
•Leveraging our Direct-Store-Delivery ("DSD") Network for growth. In fiscal 2021, we deployed a new handheld technology, High Jump, to drive productivity and customer service levels. This new technology enhances the capability of and includes features not available on our previous handheld technology, including the ability to execute our pre-sell strategy. We have also recently expanded dedicated new business resources to capture market share. Additionally, we are focused on building partnerships that utilize our current distribution capabilities to expose us to industry and product innovation. 
•OmniChannel Sales Capability. We are focused on increasing our presence with leading retailers, enhancing our e-commerce platform and developing distributor partnerships. In fiscal 2021, we refreshed our current branded product websites to help build our on-line sales, and successfully launched three new ecommerce websites for our China Mist® , Boyds® and Public Domain® brands. We plan to launch more websites and expand marketing efforts during fiscal 2022.
•Product Innovation Pipeline. We are continuing to enhance our premium coffee and tea program, developing strategic partnerships, and building an advantaged allied product portfolio that resonates with our customers. We will continue to provide leadership in sustainable product solutions for our customers.
•Driving Customer Satisfaction. We are driving continuous improvement on “On-Time and In-Full” and other key service metrics. In addition, we are focused on optimizing our product commercialization process and bringing innovation to our Customers.
•Creating a commercial brewing equipment (CBE) competitive service advantage. We have one of the largest coffee service networks in the industry and are able to install, repair, and refurbish equipment. We are focused on continually improving time-to-install and time-to-repair. We have built partnerships with leading equipment manufacturers and are investing in training our team on the latest equipment offerings to enhance our service capabilities. 
We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by providing coffee, tea, and culinary expertise, service excellence, and equipment program support. We tailor solutions to our customers' needs helping them deliver a great experience for their customers, which includes: 
•Offering a wide variety of coffee, tea, and culinary products; including helping our customers achieve their sustainability goals and objectives
•Providing consumer, channel, and market insights; including ideation to support customer menu and product evaluation in line with consumer trends
•Delivering comprehensive commercial brewing equipment program support from installation to preventative maintenance to timely repair
•Providing DSD service where our trained Route Sales Representative ("RSR") orders product to keep our customers in-stock, merchandises the beverage station, rotates products, cleans and inspects equipment on-site, and performs “cup quality checks” all to ensure a great experience for the consumer. Our services provided to DSD customers are conducted primarily in person through our RSRs, who develop business relationships with chefs, restaurant owners and food buyers at their delivery locations; and 
•Providing comprehensive coffee programs to our national account customers, including private brand development, green coffee procurement, hedging, category management, sustainable sourcing and supply chain management. 
Strategic Initiatives
In fiscal 2021, we continued to activate our five key strategic initiatives:
(1) Empower Talent
•Embrace our Purpose, Vision and Values. We focus on building a performance driven culture, which has enabled us to overcome many challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Develop our Talent. We are leveraging our Learning Management System for training facilitation and tracking of training modules to support the development of our team members, and sharing best practices amongst our team members. In fiscal 2021, we also executed a virtual National Sales Meeting, which included product workshops on coffee, tea, and culinary products. 
•Recognize and Reward Performance. We have continued to recognize our top performers and aligned our incentive plans to support our annual and long-term strategy.
(2) Enrich Customer Relationships
•Drive Customer Satisfaction. Providing our customers the products they want, when they want them, is key to customer satisfaction and retention. We have invested in systems and processes to improve our ability to service our customers. 
•Build on our Brewing Equipment Service Advantage. We continue to invest in systems and processes to enable a more efficient go-to-market with our equipment program. From installation, to preventative maintenance, and timely repair execution, our trained service technicians and equipment remanufacturing capabilities provide reliable, consistent service coverage across a wide geographic area which we believe is a competitive advantage.
•Develop DSD Capabilities. In order to better serve certain customer’s needs, we expanded our Tel-Sell (Roastery Direct) program in fiscal 2021. This program enables us to better service customers outside our DSD network who want to purchase our products. We pick, pack, and ship products to these customers via common carriers. We are also implementing a Pre-Sell DSD model in select markets. In this model, we sell to our customers in advance of the delivery, enabling more quality time with our customers, and more deliveries per day at a lower average cost.
(3) Enhance Processes and Systems
•Upgrade our Route Handheld Technology. In fiscal 2021, we fully implemented a new handheld technology across our DSD network, High Jump, which enhances the capability and features not available on our previous handheld technology. As a result, we have seen improvement in route productivity. 
•Investment in Technology. We are implementing IT applications which we expect to enhance e-commerce and supply chain optimization and flexibility. We believe for our owned brands as well as for our customers these applications will enable a more robust Roastery Direct program, as well as coffee house and subscription sales. We expect this will lead to improved customer analytics, and enable better product targeting. We also continue to invest in and enhance other IT capabilities to provide back-office support for our key strategic initiatives. 
(4) Execute Optimization
•Improve Demand Planning. We are in process of developing new tools to provide better visibility to customer demand. We are working closely with our key vendor partners to create a more robust demand and supply process and implementing a sales demand consensus model.
•Manufacturing and Distribution Network Optimization Plan. We continue to develop and execute manufacturing network optimization, which included opening a distribution center in Rialto, California which is geographically closer to many of our customers in the Western United States, as well as consolidating third party frozen distribution services. Additionally, we continue to evaluate our branch footprint to determine the optimal structure to deliver products to our DSD customers more efficiently and effectively. These initiatives, among others, reduce our transportation and warehousing cost.
•SKU Optimization. We continued optimizing our SKU portfolio, and have reduced the number of underperforming coffee and allied products, and have reduced components and packaging options. Since June 30, 2019, we have undertaken efforts to optimize our SKU count reducing our total SKU count by more than 48%. 
•Implement Procurement Partnerships. We are working with our vendor partners to enhance the portions of our inventory program that are vendor managed. We have implemented quarterly business reviews with key vendor partners. 
(5) Elevate Innovation
•Expand Sustainability Program. We continue to enhance our sustainable product offerings and incorporate sustainability as we develop new products. We are developing marketing campaigns to better communicate our program portfolio as a differentiator for our customers, inclusive of our capability to restore and refurbish equipment. 
•Evolve our Product Portfolio. We are actively developing product solutions that align with emerging consumer trends with premium coffee and tea products. We are partnering with our equipment suppliers on equipment innovation. We are developing our espresso based beverage program and actively optimizing our allied product offerings. 
•Renovate Product Portfolio. As consumers shift in the demand for healthier food and beverage products, we look to future opportunities to reformulate our existing product lines with clean label offerings and provide more "Better for You" product offerings.
Expand Sustainability Leadership
•Sustainability. We believe that our collective efforts in measuring our social and environmental impact, creating programs for waste, water and energy reduction, promoting partnerships in our supply chain that aim at supply chain stability and food security, and focusing on employee engagement place us in a unique position to help retailers and foodservice operators create differentiated coffee and tea programs that can include sustainable supply chains, direct trade purchasing, training and technical assistance, recycling and composting networks, and packaging material reductions. During fiscal 2021 we were part of the 2020 CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard. This means that we were among the top 7% of participants for supplier engagement on climate change, based on our 2020 CDP disclosure. Further, in fiscal 2021, we published our annual sustainability report based on the Global Reporting Initiative’s comprehensive compliance standard. In addition, China Mist is a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership (the “ETP”), a non-profit organization that works to improve the sustainability of the tea sector, the lives of tea workers and farmers, and the environment in which tea is produced. As a member of the ETP, China Mist sources all of its tea from tea plantations that are certified, monitored, and regularly audited by the ETP.
•Science-Based Carbon Reduction Targets. We believe combating climate change is critical to the future of our company, the coffee industry, coffee growers and the world. In fiscal 2021 we made progress towards our science based carbon reduction targets. With a new baseline established in fiscal 2018, we set more ambitious goals in line with efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Setting approved targets places us among those responsible businesses that are making measurable contributions to incorporate sustainability within their business strategy. 
•Zero Waste to Landfill. Achieving zero waste in our production and distribution facilities is a significant step in reaching our overall sustainability goals. In fiscal 2021 we maintained our goal of 90% waste diversion for our primary production and distribution facilities. To accomplish this goal, we have focused on the circularity of our waste streams, making partnerships to reuse them, reintroducing them as inputs for new products, or recycling them and composting them when none of the previous options are possible.
•LEED® Certified Facilities. Our Portland production and distribution facility was one of the first in the Northwest to achieve LEED® Silver Certification. Our corporate office in Northlake, Texas has also achieved LEED® Silver Certification.
•Expansion of Project D.I.R.E.C.T.® Program. In fiscal 2021, we continued to grow our direct trade sourcing model, Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®. This model is an impact-based product or raw material sourcing framework that utilizes data-based sustainability metrics to influence an inclusive, collaborative approach to sustainability along the supply chain. To evaluate whether coffee is Project D.I.R.E.C.T.®, we follow an outcome-based evaluation framework. The result of this evaluation impacts where we invest our resources within our supply chain and has led to an increased level of transparency for us. 
•Green Coffee Traceability. We are committed to the inclusion of more sustainably-sourced coffees in our supply chain. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when customers, roasters and suppliers cannot see back into their supply chain. To address these concerns, as well as to deepen our commitment to the longevity of the coffee industry, we track traceability levels from all green coffee suppliers on a per-contract basis. During fiscal 2021, we continued to monitor purchases from coffee suppliers and asked for them to provide traceability information on a per contract basis. This helps us to bring transparency to our supply chain, rank our suppliers, and also to identify opportunities to select trusted providers, cooperatives, mills, exporters, etc., when offering sustainable coffees to our customers.
•Supplier Sustainability. We are committed to working with suppliers who share our social, environmental and economic sustainability goals. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when suppliers are not held to the same strict standards to which we hold ourselves. To address this concern, all existing suppliers and new suppliers must acknowledge and adhere to our Supplier Standards of Engagement. These Standards of Engagement are aligned with the United Nations Global Compact and set minimum standards for suppliers that are designed to provide Farmer Bros. visibility into all aspects of its supply chain and meets these objectives. These Standards of Engagement also serve as Supplier’s Certificate of Compliance, executed by the supplier, representing supplier's receipt and acknowledgment of the Standards of Engagement and agreement to comply with the same. 
Charitable Activities
We view charitable involvement as a part of our corporate responsibility and sustainability model: Social, Environmental, and Economic Development, or SEED. We endorse and support communities where our customers, employees, businesses, and suppliers are located, and who have enthusiastically supported us over the past 100 years. Our objective is to provide support toward a mission of supply chain stability with a focus on food security.
Recipient organizations include those with strong local and regional networks that ensure families have access to nutritious food. Donations may take the form of corporate cash contributions, product donations, employee volunteerism, and workplace giving (with or without matching contributions).
•Recipient organizations include Feeding America, Ronald McDonald House, and local food banks.
•We support industry organizations such as World Coffee Research, which commits to grow, protect, and enhance supplies of quality coffee while improving the livelihoods of the families who produce it, and the Specialty Coffee Association (“SCA”) Sustainability Council and the Coalition for Coffee Communities, which are focused on sustainability in coffee growing regions.
•Our employee-driven CAFÉ Crew organizes employee involvement at local charities and fund raisers, including support of Team Ronald McDonald House, riding in the Ride Against Hunger supported by Tarrant Area Food Bank, hosting local food drives and donation of Farmer Bros. products nearing the end of their shelf life to organizations related to Feeding America.
•Our usable and near expiring products or products with damaged packaging that can be donated are donated to Feeding America affiliated food banks nationwide, in an effort to keep all edible food waste from going to landfills.
Human Capital
On June 30, 2021, we employed approximately 1,064 employees, 164 of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements expiring on or before January 31, 2025. 
Achieving our vision of building a leading specialty products distributor and service company starts with our people. We believe our human capital management philosophy and programs align with developing and sustaining a culture that embraces our team member values of family, service and quality, collaboration, simplicity and sustainability. We emphasize our value of family by striving for inclusive and equitable approaches in hiring practices, pay practices and team member engagement. 
We continue to attract, develop and retain our team members with the following programs: 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We know our customers represent a wide range of backgrounds and experiences and we strive to build a team that is as diverse and inclusive as our customers. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") committee is comprised of team members across all functions and levels of the organization, including members of the senior management team, and reaches team members across the organization. Our commitments to DEI include: 
•Our partnership with Paul Quinn College, which is the oldest historically black college in Texas. This partnership has allowed us to create a pipeline of diverse leaders that will help build a strong future for Farmer Brothers.
•Engagement with the Texas Workforce Commission to adapt jobs for people with disabilities that may make it difficult to work in a traditional manufacturing setting. Through this program, we have been able to fill multiple roles and will be looking to expand.
•Commencement of a project with the National Organization on Disabilities to review our practices, train our leaders and help us increase our engagement with people with disabilities.
•Training on unconscious bias and equal opportunity topics such as harassment and discrimination. 
Team Member Benefits
We value each team member and, as a result, we strive to provide a Total Rewards Programs that delivers the features that our team members value. To accomplish this, we have conducted surveys of our team members over the last two years to make sure we are investing in areas that our people value. Based on team member feedback and in alignment with our values of family and simplicity, we have emphasized: 
•Stability of our team member benefits costs. 
•Expansion of the scope of our benefit programs and options. This has included company-paid short-term disability as well as paid parental leave for all non-union team members. 
•Improvement of our overall team member experience, including investments in HR technology.
•Implementation a comprehensive Benefits Assistance Center to help employees understand their benefits better.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our team members is crucial. In addition to tracking common indicators, such as injury rates, we have taken a proactive approach to work place safety, including regular companywide safety training, fleet safety reviews, and our measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2022, we plan to roll out an extensive driver safety curriculum to help keep our team members and others safer on the road. 
We manufacture and distribute products deemed essential to the critical infrastructure, and as a result, our production sites continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we implemented company safety guidelines improving the physical safety of work environments for our employees that continued to report to work sites. These measures have 
included increased sanitation procedures, limiting or prohibiting guests to work sites, hand washing, social distancing, mask wearing and temperature checks as well as encouraging individuals to stay home when ill. Further, we provided work from home flexibility for our team members whose jobs did not require them to report to a specific job site, further limiting exposure for our team members. 
Industry and Market Leadership
We have made the following investments in an effort to ensure we are well-positioned within the industry to take advantage of category trends, industry insights, and general coffee, tea and allied product knowledge to grow our business:
•Coffee Industry Leadership. Through our dedication to the craft of sourcing, blending and roasting coffee, and our participation and/or leadership positions with the SCA, National Coffee Association, Coalition for Coffee Communities, International Women's Coffee Alliance, Pacific Coast Coffee Association, Roasters Guild and World Coffee Research, we work to help shape the future of the coffee industry. We believe that due to our commitment to the industry, large retail and foodservice operators are drawn to working with us. We were among the first coffee roasters in the nation to receive SCA certification of a state-of-the-art coffee lab, which includes our product development labs at the Northlake, Texas and Portland, Oregon facilities. 
•Market Insight and Consumer Research. We have developed a market insight capability internally that reinforces our business-to-business positioning as a thought leader in the coffee, tea and food service industries. We invest in proprietary consumer and customer segmentation studies and provide trend insights and product development support that help our customers create winning products and integrated marketing strategies. Within this, we are focused on understanding key demographic groups and their attitudes and behaviors to better position the Company as a consumer brand at retail and e-commerce and expand these sales channels. 
Raw Materials and Supplies
Our primary raw material is green coffee, an exchange-traded agricultural commodity that is subject to price fluctuations. Over the past five years, the coffee “C” market near month price per pound ranged from approximately $0.88 to $1.74. The coffee “C” market near month price as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $1.60 and $1.04 per pound, respectively. Our principal packaging materials include carton board, corrugate and plastic. We also use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities.
We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee regions around the world. Coffee “C” market prices in fiscal 2021 traded in a $0.67 cent range during the year, and averaged 4% above the historical average for the past five years. There can be no assurance that green coffee prices will remain at these levels in the future. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers, including Direct Trade and Fair Trade Certified™ sources and Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms. Fair Trade Certified™ provides an assurance that farmer groups are receiving the Fair Trade minimum price and an additional premium for certified organic products through arrangements with cooperatives. Direct Trade products provide similar assurance except that the arrangements are provided directly to individual coffee growers instead of to cooperatives, providing these farmers with price premiums and dedicated technical assistance to improve farm conditions and increase both quality and productivity of sustainable coffee crops at the individual farm level. Rainforest Alliance Certified™ coffee is grown using methods that help promote and preserve biodiversity, conserve scarce natural resources, and help farmers build sustainable lives. Our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through customer arrangements and derivative instruments, as further explained in Note 4, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. 
Intellectual Property
We own a number of United States trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own other trademarks and service marks for which we have filed applications for U.S. registration. We have licenses to use certain trademarks outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. We believe our trademarks and service marks are integral to customer identification of our products. It is not possible to assess the impact of the loss of such identification. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their 
registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. In addition, we own numerous copyrights, registered and unregistered, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, and other proprietary rights that are not registered.
Seasonality
We experience some seasonal influences. The winter months historically have generally been our strongest sales months. However, our product line and geographic diversity provide some sales stability during the warmer months when coffee consumption ordinarily decreases. Additionally, we usually experience an increase in sales during the summer and early fall months from seasonal businesses located in vacation areas and from grocery retailers ramping up inventory for the winter selling season. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Distribution
We operate production facilities in Northlake, Texas; Portland, Oregon; and Hillsboro, Oregon. Distribution takes place out of the Northlake facility, the Portland and Hillsboro facilities, as well as separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois, Rialto, California, and Moonachie, New Jersey. Our products reach our customers primarily in the following ways: through our nationwide DSD network of 213 delivery routes and 94 branch warehouses as of June 30, 2021, or direct-shipped via common carriers or third-party distributors. DSD sales are primarily made “off-truck” to our customers at their places of business. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products through our DSD network, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. We maintain inventory levels at each branch warehouse to promote minimal interruption in supply. We also sell coffee and tea products directly to consumers through our websites and sell certain products at retail and through foodservice distributors. 
Customers
We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers and large national account customers like restaurant, department and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, healthcare facilities, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as retail with private brand and consumer-branded coffee and tea products, foodservice distributors, and consumers through e-commerce. During fiscal 2021, our top five customers accounted for approximately 23.6% of our net sales. Although no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years, the loss of, or reduction in, sales to one or more of our top customers would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Most of our customers rely on us for distribution; however, some of our customers use third-party distribution or conduct their own distribution. Some of our customers are “price” buyers, seeking a low-cost provider with less concern for service, while others find great value in the service programs we provide. We offer a full return policy to ensure satisfaction and extended terms for those customers who qualify. Historically, our product returns have not been significant.
Competition and Trends
The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience, technology and innovation, and competition could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry and industry consolidation. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, such as The J.M. Smucker Company (Folgers Coffee) and The Kraft Heinz Company (Maxwell House Coffee), wholesale foodservice distributors such as Sysco Corporation and US Foods, regional and national coffee roasters such as S&D Coffee & Tea (WestRock Corporation), Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, Trilliant Food and Nutrition LLC, Gaviña & Sons, Inc., Royal Cup, Inc., Ronnoco Coffee, LLC, and Community Coffee Company, L.L.C., specialty coffee suppliers such as Rogers Family Company, Distant Lands Coffee, Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee Inc., Starbucks Corporation and Peet’s Coffee & Tea (JAB Holding Company), and retail brand beverage manufacturers such as Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores (physical and on-line) such as Costco, Sam’s Club and Restaurant Depot and on-line retailers such as Amazon. We also face competition from growth in the single-serve, ready-to-drink coffee beverage and cold-brewed coffee channels, as well as competition from other beverages, such as soft drinks (including highly caffeinated energy drinks), juices, bottled water, teas and other beverages.
We believe our state-of-the-art production facility, longevity, product quality and offerings, national distribution and equipment service network, industry and sustainability leadership, market insight, comprehensive approach to customer relationship management, and superior customer service are the major factors that differentiate us from our competitors. We compete well when these factors are valued by our customers, and we are less effective when only price matters. Our customer base is price sensitive, and we are often faced with price competition. 
In fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The measures taken to contain the spread of the virus adversely affected our business and those of our customers. Our success will depend on our ability and effectiveness in identifying and addressing our customers’ future needs in light of the development of COVID-19, its variants and responsive measures. Although we have already experienced some negative effects of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the extent and timing of the impact that a resurgence could have on our customer demand.
Regulatory Environment
 The conduct of our businesses, including, among other things, the production, storage, distribution, sale, labeling, quality and safety of our products, and occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. Our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material legal proceedings arising under these regulations except as described in Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. For additional information, see "Risk Factors" under the sub-captions "Risks Related to Our Business and Industry" and "Risks Related to Governance, Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Matters"
Other
 The nature of our business does not provide for maintenance of or reliance upon a sales backlog. None of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government. We have no material revenues from foreign operations or long-lived assets located in foreign countries.
