Item 1. Business
MDC PARTNERS INC.
MDC was formed by Certificate of Amalgamation effective December 19, 1986, pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Ontario). Effective December 19, 1986, MDC amalgamated with Branbury Explorations Limited, and thereby became a public company operating under the name of MDC Corporation. On January 1, 2004, MDC changed its name to its current name, MDC Partners Inc., and on June 28, 2004, MDC was continued under Section 187 of the Canada Business Corporations Act. MDC’s registered address is located at 33 Draper Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5V 2M3, and its head office address is located at 745 Fifth Avenue, 19th Floor, New York, New York 10151.
About Us
MDC is a leading provider of global marketing, advertising, activation, communications and strategic consulting solutions. MDC and its Partner Firms (as defined below) deliver a wide range of customized services, including (1) global advertising and marketing services, (2) media buying, planning and optimization, (3) interactive and mobile marketing, (4) direct marketing, (5) database and customer relationship management, (6) sales promotion, (7) corporate communications, (8) market research, (9) data analytics and insights, (10) corporate identity, design and branding services, (11) social media communications, (12) product and service innovation and (13) e-commerce management.
Market Strategy
MDC’s strategy is to build, grow and acquire market-leading businesses that deliver innovative, value-added marketing, activation, communications and strategic consulting services to their clients. By doing so, MDC strives to be a partnership of marketing communications and consulting companies (or “Partner Firms”) whose strategic, creative and innovative solutions are media-agnostic, challenge the status quo, achieve measurable superior returns on investment, and drive transformative growth and business performance for its clients and stakeholders.
The MDC model is driven by three key elements:
Perpetual Partnership.  The perpetual partnership model creates ongoing alignment of interests between MDC and its Partner Firms to drive the Company’s overall performance by (1) identifying the “right” Partner Firms with a sustainable differentiated position in the marketplace, (2) creating the “right” partnership structure by taking a majority ownership position and leaving a substantial noncontrolling equity or economic ownership position in the hands of operating management to incentivize long-term growth, (3) providing succession planning support and compensation models to incentivize future leaders and second-generation executives, (4) leveraging the network's scale to provide access to strategic resources and best practices and (5) focusing on delivering financial results.
Entrepreneurialism.  The entrepreneurial spirit of both MDC and its Partner Firms is optimized through (1) its unique perpetual partnership model that incentivizes senior-level involvement and ambition, (2) access to shared resources within the Corporate Group that allow individual firms to focus on client business and company growth and (3) MDC’s collaborative creation of customized solutions to support and grow Partner Firm businesses.
Human and Financial Capital.  The perpetual partnership model balances accountability with financial flexibility and meaningful incentives to support growth.
Financial Reporting Segments
MDC conducts its business through its network of Partner Firms, the “Advertising and Communications Group”, who provide a comprehensive array of marketing and communications services for clients both domestically and globally. The Partner Firms provide a wide range of service offerings, which in some cases are the same or similar service offerings. The core or principal service offerings are the key factors that distinguish the Partner Firms from one another. Each Partner Firm represents an operating segment and the Company aggregates its Partner Firms to report in four reportable segments, plus an “All Other” category.
The four reportable segments are as follows:
Global Integrated Agencies - This segment is comprised of the Company’s six global, integrated Partner Firms with broad marketing communication capabilities, including advertising, branding, digital, social media, design and production services, serving multinational clients around the world. 
Domestic Creative Agencies - This segment is comprised of four Partner Firms that are national advertising agencies leveraging creative capabilities at their core.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Specialist Communications - This segment is comprised of seven Partner Firms that are each communications agencies with core service offerings in public relations and related communications services. 
Media Services - This segment is comprised of a unique single operating segment with media buying and planning as its core competency.
The All Other category consists of the Company's remaining Partner Firms that provide a range of diverse marketing communication services, but are not eligible for aggregation with the reportable segments. Each of the Partner Firms in the All Other category represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue and do not meet the criteria to be a separate reportable segment.
In addition, MDC reports its corporate office expenses incurred in connection with the strategic resources provided to the Partner Firms, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to the Partner Firms as Corporate. Corporate provides client and business development support to the Partner Firms as well as certain strategic resources, including accounting, administrative, financial, real estate, human resource and legal functions. Additional expenses managed by the corporate office that are directly related to the Partner Firms are allocated to the appropriate reportable segment and the All Other category.
For further information relating to the Company’s segments, including financial information, refer to Note 14 (Segment Information) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report and to “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Ownership Information
The table below sets forth MDC’s voting ownership percentage of each listed Partner Firm as of December 31, 2016.  The table does not display all agencies or components within each Partner Firm, for which MDC may or may not maintain the same ownership percentage. MDC maintains a majority or 100% ownership position in substantially all of its Partner Firms, with management of the agencies owning the remaining equity if any.  However, MDC’s effective economic interest in each Partner Firm may vary from its voting ownership interest due to certain factors, such as the existence of contingent deferred acquisition payments and/or cash distribution limitations related to noncontrolling interest holders.  See footnote 4 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company’s contingent purchase price obligations and noncontrolling interests.

Competition
In the competitive, highly fragmented marketing and communications industry, MDC’s Partner Firms compete for business and talent with the operating subsidiaries of large global holding companies such as Omnicom Group Inc., Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., WPP plc, Publicis Groupe SA, Dentsu Inc. and Havas SA. These global holding companies generally have greater resources than those available to MDC and its subsidiaries, and such resources may enable them to aggressively compete with the Company’s marketing communications businesses. Each of MDC’s Partner Firms also faces competition from numerous independent agencies that operate in multiple markets, as well as newer competitors such as IT consulting, tech platforms, and other services firms that have begun to offer marketing-related services. MDC’s Partner Firms must compete with all of these other companies to maintain existing client relationships and to obtain new clients and assignments. MDC’s Partner Firms compete at this level by providing clients with disruptive marketing ideas and strategies that are focused on increasing clients’ revenues and profits. These existing and potential clients include multinational corporations and national companies with mid-to-large sized marketing budgets. MDC also benefits from cooperation among its entrepreneurial Partner Firms through referrals and the sharing of both services and expertise, which enables MDC to service clients’ varied marketing needs around the world by crafting custom integrated solutions.
A Partner Firm’s ability to compete for new clients is affected in some instances by the policy, which many advertisers and marketers impose, of not permitting their agencies to represent competitive accounts in the same market. In the vast majority of cases, however, MDC’s consistent maintenance of separate, independent operating companies has enabled MDC to represent competing clients across its network.
Industry Trends
There are several recent economic and industry trends that affect or may be expected to affect the Company’s results of operations. Historically, advertising has been the primary service provided by the marketing communications industry. However, as clients aim to establish one-to-one relationships with customers, and more accurately measure the effectiveness of their marketing expenditures, specialized and digital communications services and database marketing and analytics are consuming a growing portion of marketing dollars. The Company believes these changes in the way consumers interact with media is increasing the demand for a broader range of non-advertising marketing communications services (i.e., direct marketing, sales promotion, interactive, mobile, strategic communications and public relations), which we expect could have a positive impact on our results of operations. In addition, the rise of technology and data solutions have rendered scale less crucial as it once was in areas such as media buying, creating significant opportunities for agile and modern players. Global marketers now demand breakthrough and integrated creative ideas, and no longer require traditional brick-and-mortar communications partners in every market to optimize the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. Combined with the fragmentation of the media landscape, these factors provide new opportunities for small to mid-sized communications companies like those in the MDC network. In addition, marketers now require ever greater speed-to-market to drive financial returns on their marketing and media investment, causing them to turn to more nimble, entrepreneurial and collaborative communications firms like MDC Partner Firms.
As client procurement departments have focused increasingly on marketing services company fees in recent years, the Company has invested in resources to work with client procurement departments to ensure that we are able to deliver against client goals in a mutually beneficial way. For example, the Company has explored new compensation models, such as performance-based incentive payments and equity, in order to greater align our success with our clients. These incentive payments may offset negative pricing pressure from client procurement departments.

Clients
The Company serves clients in virtually every industry, and in many cases, the same clients in various locations, and through several Partner Firms and across many disciplines. Representation of a client rarely means that MDC handles marketing communications for all brands or product lines of the client in every geographical location. For further information regarding revenues and long-lived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
MDC’s agencies have written contracts with many of their clients. As is customary in the industry, these contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Executive Overview” for a further discussion of MDC’s arrangements with its clients.
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not have a client that accounted for 5% or more of revenues. In addition, MDC’s ten largest clients (measured by revenue generated) accounted for 23%, 24% and 24% of 2016, 2015 and 2014 revenues, respectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, MDC and its subsidiaries had the following number of employees:

Segment | Total
Global Integrated Agencies | 3,131
Domestic Creative Agencies | 418 
Specialist Communications | 678 
Media Services | 524 
All Other | 1,309
Corporate | 78 
Total | 6,138

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of the effect of cost of services sold on MDC’s historical results of operations. Because of the personal service character of the marketing communications businesses, the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to MDC’s continuing success. MDC considers its relations with its employees to be satisfactory.
Effect of Environmental Laws
MDC believes it is substantially in compliance with all regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, and such regulations have not had a material effect on the capital expenditures or operations of MDC.
