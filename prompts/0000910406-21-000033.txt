Item 1.        Business                                            
Overview 
The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, along with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” and herein referred to as “Hain Celestial,” “we,” “us” and “our”), was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Lake Success, New York. The Company’s mission has continued to evolve since its founding, with health and wellness being the core tenet. The Company continues to be a leading marketer, manufacturer and seller of organic and natural, “better-for-you” products by anticipating and exceeding consumer expectations in providing quality, innovation, value and convenience. The Company is committed to growing sustainably while continuing to implement environmentally sound business practices and manufacturing processes. Hain Celestial sells its products through specialty and natural food distributors, supermarkets, natural food stores, mass-market and e-commerce retailers, food service channels and club, drug and convenience stores in over 80 countries worldwide. 
The Company manufactures, markets, distributes and sells organic and natural products under brand names that are sold as “better-for-you” products, providing consumers with the opportunity to lead A Healthier Way of Life®. Hain Celestial is a leader in many organic and natural product categories, with many recognized brands in the various market categories it serves, including Celestial Seasonings®, Clarks™, Cully & Sully®, Earth’s Best®, Ella’s Kitchen®, Frank Cooper’s®, Gale’s®, Garden of Eatin’®, Hain Pure Foods®, Hartley’s®, Health Valley®, Imagine®, Joya®, Lima®, Linda McCartney’s® (under license), MaraNatha®, Natumi®, New Covent Garden Soup Co.®, Robertson’s®, Rose’s® (under license), Sensible Portions®, Spectrum®, Sun-Pat®, Terra®, The Greek Gods®, Yorkshire Provender® and Yves Veggie Cuisine®. The Company’s personal care products are marketed under the Alba Botanica®, Avalon Organics®, JASON®, Live Clean®, and Queen Helene® brands.
The Company continues to execute the four key pillars of its strategy to: (1) simplify its portfolio; (2) strengthen its capabilities; (3) expand profit margins and cash flow; and (4) reinvigorate profitable topline growth. The Company has executed this strategy with a focus on discontinuing uneconomic investment, realigning resources to coincide with brand importance, reducing unproductive stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) and brands and reassessing current pricing architecture. As part of this initiative, the Company reviewed its product portfolio within North America and divided it into “Get Bigger” and “Get Better” brand categories.
The Company’s “Get Bigger” brands represent its strongest brands with high margins, which compete in categories with strong growth potential. The Company has concentrated its investment in marketing, innovation and other resources to prioritize spending for these brands, in an effort to reinvigorate profitable topline growth, optimize assortment and increase share of distribution.
The Company’s “Get Better” brands are the brands in which the Company is primarily focused on simplification and expansion of profit margin. Some of these brands have historically been low margin, non-strategic brands that added complexity with minimal benefit to the Company’s operations.
As part of the Company’s overall strategy, the Company may seek to dispose of businesses and brands that are less profitable or are otherwise less of a strategic fit within our core portfolio. During fiscal 2019, the Company divested its Hain Pure Protein reportable segment and its WestSoy® tofu, seitan and tempeh businesses. In fiscal 2020, the Company divested its Tilda business and its Arrowhead Mills®, SunSpire®, Europe's Best®, Casbah®, Rudi’s Gluten-Free Bakery™, Rudi’s Organic Bakery® and Fountain of Truth™ brands. In fiscal 2021, the Company divested its Danival® business, its United Kingdom fruit and fruit juice businesses, primarily consisting of the Orchard House® Foods Limited business and associated brands, and its WestSoy®, Dream® and GG UniqueFiber® brands. 
Productivity and Transformation Initiatives
One of the key pillars of the Company’s strategy seeks to identify areas of operating efficiencies and cost savings to expand profit margins and cash flow. In furtherance of this key pillar, we have undertaken multiple productivity and transformation initiatives, including (1) consolidating certain of the Company’s manufacturing plants, (2) implementing broader supply chain operational improvements, (3) integrating the operations of our U.S. and Canadian businesses, (4) product rationalization initiatives which are aimed at eliminating underperforming SKUs and (5) outsourcing certain functions in our North American business, including order management, billing, accounts receivable and accounts payable, to third-party service providers and the associated implementation of new procurement technology solutions.
We incur costs as part of these productivity and transformation initiatives with the objective of obtaining longer term operating efficiencies and cost savings. The costs include consulting and severance costs, moving and shut-down costs and other costs associated with carrying out the initiatives. The Company will continue to carry out the existing productivity initiatives as well as additional initiatives under this strategy in fiscal 2022.
Discontinued Operations
On August 27, 2019, the Company and Ebro Foods S.A. (the “Purchaser”) entered into, and consummated the transactions contemplated by, an agreement relating to the sale and purchase of the Tilda Group Entities and certain other assets. The Company sold the entities comprising its Tilda operating segment and certain other assets of the Tilda business to the Purchaser for an aggregate price of $341.8 million.
On February 15, 2019, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets used primarily for the Plainville Farms business, a component of the Company’s Hain Pure Protein Corporation (“HPPC”) operating segment. On June 28, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the remainder of HPPC and Empire Kosher which included the FreeBird and Empire Kosher businesses. These dispositions were undertaken to reduce complexity in the Company’s operations and simplify the Company’s brand portfolio, in addition to allowing additional flexibility to focus on opportunities for growth and innovation in the Company’s more profitable and faster growing core businesses. Collectively, these dispositions were reported in the aggregate as the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment.
These dispositions represented strategic shifts that had a major impact on the Company’s operations and financial results and therefore, the Company is presenting the operating results and cash flows of the Tilda operating segment and the Hain Pure Protein reportable segment within discontinued operations in the current and prior periods. See Note 5, Dispositions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Environmental, Social and Governance
We are focused on growing our business sustainably by delivering long-term value for our customers, suppliers, stockholders, employees and the communities where we live and work. As part of our vision to maximize stakeholder value, we are committed to incorporating environmental, social and related governance (“ESG”) principles into our business strategies and organizational culture. The Healthier Way Framework (Healthier People, Products, and Planet) set out in our most recent Sustainability Report (available at hain.com/company/ESG) provides our guiding principles for ESG initiatives. 
We are making improvements to our ESG reporting to make it easier for our stockholders and other constituents to find details on our ESG commitments and progress, which will appear in our upcoming fiscal year 2021 ESG Report which we plan to make available at hain.com/company/ESG.
Our prior Sustainability Reports and, when issued, the fiscal year 2021 ESG Report, are not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Form 10-K or incorporated into any of our other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Human Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 3,087 employees, with approximately 45% located in North America and approximately 55% located outside of North America. Approximately 63% of our employees in North America and approximately 61% of our employees outside of North America were based in our production facilities. Substantially all of our employees are full-time, permanent employees.
Our employees are critical to our success. The following programs, initiatives and principles encompass some of the human capital objectives and measures that we focus on in managing our business and in seeking to attract and retain a talented workforce.
Our Culture and Our Vision, Mission and Values
Our culture is shaped by our vision, mission and values. Our vision is to inspire healthier living for all. To achieve this aspiration, our mission is to build enduring health and wellness brands that are known and loved by consumers and enrich the lives of employees and all of our stakeholders. We live by our values of teamwork, integrity and entrepreneurship – we think and act with a broad company perspective, we do the right thing, and we think innovatively and challenge the status quo.
Diversity and Inclusion
People have always been our greatest asset. They are the very heart of our Company, and we believe everyone should feel encouraged, respected and welcomed in our workplace.
Diversity and inclusion drives success, and we believe that our employees’ diverse backgrounds and experiences are essential to helping us all to continue to thrive internally and deliver innovative products to our customers. We promote fairness by practicing equal opportunity in all decisions about hiring, compensation, training, promotions and every other aspect of employment.
We have established a permanent Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Council in North America to create and foster a workplace that reflects and contributes to the diverse, global communities in which we do business. During fiscal 2021, our D&I Council launched unconscious bias training for all non-production employees to expand our perspectives and foster collective growth. We are also working to build our D&I efforts into recruitment, retention and internal mobility.
As of June 30, 2021, our global workforce was 59% male and 41% female. In the United States, on an employee self-reported basis, the racial/ethnic composition of our workforce was approximately 43% White, 35% Hispanic or Latino, 13% Black or African American, 6% Asian and 3% other. We intend to share additional workforce demographics data in our upcoming fiscal year 2021 ESG Report which we will make available at hain.com/company/ESG. The fiscal year 2021 ESG Report is not a part of this Form 10-K or incorporated into any of our other filings made with the SEC.
Employee Health and Safety
Employee safety is always front and center. We invest in the health, safety, development and well-being of our employees. In an effort to ensure workplace safety, we train employees on how to follow our detailed, written safety standards and procedures, and the law, and to watch for and report anything potentially harmful. Our safety key performance indicators are reviewed weekly, monthly and annually to ensure quick feedback and to address safety issues as soon as they arise.
As an example of our commitment to health and safety, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority continued to be the well-being of our employees and consumers. We continue to consistently meet or exceed government regulations for addressing the health and safety of our employees during the pandemic. During the early part of the pandemic, we created the Hain Helping Hain Fund to provide assistance to employees globally who experience severe financial hardship due to the pandemic or another catastrophic event. In addition, we have developed and implemented programs to assist employees with incremental expenses they may be incurring due to childcare, commutation and overtime needs unique to the pandemic.
Training and Development
We offer a number of programs that help North American based employees progress in their careers—including a variety of training resources via LinkedIn Learning, which houses digital courses taught by industry experts covering a wide range of business topics.
In the United Kingdom, we have various employee development programs named “Hain Pathway.” One program introduces employees to key skills to support management development, followed by an intermediate level as the learning journey evolves. Another Hain Pathway program supports leadership development for employees who have been identified as leadership candidates. In addition to the Hain Pathway programs, we offer U.K. employees self-paced online training relating to compliance, policy, leadership and management development, IT, health & safety and a variety of soft skills.
Benefits
Our employee benefits vary by region but generally include:
•Medical, Dental, Vision Benefits;
•Retirement Savings and Pension Plans;
•Commuter Benefits;
•Wellness Initiatives;
•Tuition Reimbursement; and
•Paid Parental Leave including births, adoptions or placements of foster children.
Employee Satisfaction and Engagement
We aim to foster a culture of open communications and have implemented a global systematic employee engagement process in which employees are surveyed periodically (quarterly in the United States). Our Executive Leadership Team regularly reviews the results and considers and implements action items to address areas that need improvement. We have additional regional 
programs and policies in place to encourage open communications with management and Human Resources about employees’ ideas, concerns and how they are doing.
Products
During fiscal 2021, we sold our organic, natural, and “better-for-you” products primarily in the following categories: tea; snacks; personal care; and grocery. We continuously evaluate our existing products for quality, taste, nutritional value and cost and make improvements where possible. We discontinue products or SKUs when sales of those items do not warrant further production. Our product categories consist of the following:
Tea
Under the Celestial Seasonings® brand, we currently offer more than 100 varieties of herbal, green, black, wellness, rooibos and chai tea. Tea products accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021, 6% in fiscal 2020, and 5% in fiscal 2019.
Snacks
Our snack products include a variety of potato, root vegetable and other exotic vegetable chips, straws, tortilla chips, whole grain chips, pita chips and puffs. Snack products accounted for approximately 16% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021, 15% in fiscal 2020 and 14% in fiscal 2019.
Personal Care
Our personal care products cover a variety of personal care categories including hand, skin, hair and oral care, deodorants, body washes, sunscreens and lotions. Personal care products accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales in each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Grocery
Grocery products include infant formula, infant, toddler and kids’ foods, plant-based beverages (such as soy, rice, oat, almond and coconut), condiments, cooking and culinary oils, cereal bars, canned, chilled fresh, aseptic and instant soups, yogurts, nut butters, juices, hot-eating desserts, cookies, refrigerated and frozen plant-based meat-alternative products, jams, fruit spreads, jelly, honey, natural sweeteners and marmalade products, as well as other food products. Grocery products accounted for approximately 67% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021, 69% in fiscal 2020 and 72% in fiscal 2019.
Seasonality
Certain of our product lines have seasonal fluctuations in demand. Hot tea, hot-eating desserts and soup sales are stronger in colder months, while sales of snack foods, sunscreen and certain of our personal care products are stronger in the warmer months. As such, our results of operations and our cash flows for any particular quarter are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year, and our historical seasonality may not be indicative of future quarterly results of operations. In recent years, net sales and diluted earnings per share in the first fiscal quarter have typically been the lowest of our four quarters.
Working Capital
For information relating to our cash flows from operations and working capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Segments
Our organization structure consists of two geographic based reportable segments: North America and International. Our North America reportable segment consists of the United States and Canada as operating segments. The International reportable segment is made of three operating segments: United Kingdom, Ella’s Kitchen UK and Europe. This structure is in line with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker assesses our performance and allocates resources.
We use segment net sales and operating income to evaluate performance and to allocate resources. We believe these measures are most relevant in order to analyze segment results and trends. Segment operating income excludes certain general corporate 
expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), impairment and acquisition related expenses, restructuring, integration and other charges.
The following table presents the Company’s net sales by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands, other than percentages which may not add due to rounding):

 | Fiscal Year Ended June 30,

North America | $ | 1,104,128 | | 56 | % | | $ | 1,171,478 | | 57 | % | $ | 1,195,979 | 57 | %
International | 866,174 | | 44 | % | | 882,425 | | 43 | % | | 908,627 | 43 | %

Walmart Inc. and its affiliates together accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 11% of our consolidated sales for the fiscal 
years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which were primarily related to the United States, Canada and United Kingdom operating segments. No other customer accounted for at least 10% of our net sales in the past three fiscal years. 
Foreign Operations
We sell our products to customers in more than 80 countries. Sales outside of the United States represented approximately 52%, 51% and 50% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Marketing
We aim to meet the consumer at multiple points in their journey, both pre-shop and during purchase, both in-store and online. We use a combination of trade and consumer advertising and promotion. Trade advertising and promotion includes placement fees, cooperative advertising, feature advertising in distribution catalogs and in-store merchandising in secondary locations.
Consumer advertising and promotion is used to build brand awareness and equity, drive trial to bring in new consumers and increase consumption. Paid social and digital advertising and public relations programs are the main drivers of brand awareness. Trial and conversion tactics include, but are not limited to, product search on Google and e-commerce sites, digital coupons, product sampling, direct mail and e-consumer relationship programs. Additionally, brand specific websites and social media pages are used to engage consumers with lifestyle, product and usage information related to specific brands.
We also utilize partnerships to help create awareness and advocacy. We partner with various influencers to help increase brand reach and relevance. For example, in the United States, our Earth’s Best® brand has an agreement with PBS Kids and Sesame Workshop, and Alba Botanica® has a full year partnership with USA Olympic and World Tour Surfer, Caroline Marks. In addition, several of our brands are proud supporters of Folds of Honor, a non-profit organization that provides educational sponsorships to military families.
New Product Initiatives Through Research and Development
Innovation, including new product development, is a key component of our growth strategy. We continuously seek to understand our consumers and develop products that address their desire for organic, natural and better-for-you alternatives to conventional packaged foods and personal care products. We have a demonstrated track record of extending our product offerings into other product categories. A team of professional product developers, including microbiologists, nutritionists, food scientists, chefs and chemists, work to develop products to meet changing consumer needs. Our research and development staff incorporates product ideas from all areas of our business in order to formulate new products. In addition to developing new products, the research and development staff routinely reformulates and improves existing products based on advances in ingredients, packaging and technology. In addition to our Company-sponsored research and development activities, in order to quickly and economically introduce our new products to market, we may partner with contract manufacturers that make our products according to our formulas or other specifications. The Company also partners with certain customers from time to time on exclusive customer initiatives. The Company’s research and development expenditures do not include the expenditures on such activities undertaken by co-packers and suppliers who develop numerous products on behalf of the Company and on their own initiative with the expectation that the Company will accept their new product ideas and market them under the Company’s brands. 
Production

During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 61%, 59% and 58%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at our own facilities.

•Schwerin, Germany, which also produces our Lima® and Joya® plant-based foods and beverages and private label products.
See “Item 2: Properties” of this Form 10-K for more information on the manufacturing facilities that we operate. 
Contract Manufacturers
In addition to the products manufactured in our own facilities, independent third-party contract manufacturers, who are referred to in our industry as co-manufacturers or co-packers, manufacture many of our products. In general, utilizing co-packers provides us with the flexibility to produce a large variety of products and the ability to enter new categories quickly and economically. Our contract manufacturers have been selected based on their production capabilities, capitalization and their specific product category expertise, and we expect to continue to partner with them to improve and expand our product offerings. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 39%, 41% and 42%, respectively, of our sales were derived from products manufactured by co-packers. We require that our co-packers comply with all applicable regulations and our quality and food safety program requirements, and compliance is verified through auditing and other activities. Additionally, the co-packers are required to ensure our products are manufactured in accordance with our finished goods specifications to ensure we meet customer expectations.
Suppliers of Ingredients and Packaging
Agricultural commodities and ingredients, including almonds, corn, dairy, fruit and vegetables, oils, rice, grains and soybeans, are the principal inputs used in our food products. Plant-based surfactants, glycerin and alcohols are the main inputs used in our personal care products.
Our certified organic and natural raw materials as well as our packaging materials are obtained from various suppliers around the world. The Company works with its suppliers to ensure the quality and safety of their ingredients and that such ingredients meet our specifications and comply with applicable regulations. These assurances are supported by our purchasing contracts, supplier expectations manual, supplier code of conduct, and technical assessments, including questionnaires, scientific data, certifications, affidavits, certificates of analysis and analytical testing, where required. Our purchasers and quality team visit major suppliers around the world to procure competitively priced, quality ingredients that meet our specifications.
We maintain long-term relationships with many of our suppliers. Purchase arrangements with ingredient suppliers are generally made annually. Purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts, and price, delivery terms and product specifications vary.
Agricultural commodities and ingredients are subject to price volatility which can be caused by a variety of factors. Our input costs began to increase significantly beginning in the latter part of fiscal 2021, and we expect that input cost inflation to continue into fiscal 2022. We mitigate the input price volatility by entering into purchase arrangements with our suppliers and by adjusting the sale price of our products.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with both large mainstream conventional packaged goods companies and natural and organic packaged foods companies. Many of these competitors enjoy significantly greater resources. Large mainstream conventional packaged goods competitors include Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Danone S.A., General Mills, Inc., The Hershey Company, The J.M. Smucker Company, Kellogg Company, Mondelez International, Inc., Nestle S.A., PepsiCo, Inc. and Unilever, and conventional personal care products companies with whom we compete include, but are not limited to, The Clorox Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, Johnson & Johnson, The Procter 
& Gamble Company and S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc. Certain of these large mainstream conventional packaged foods and personal care companies compete with us by selling both conventional products and natural and/or organic products. Natural and organic packaged foods competitors include Amy’s Kitchen, Chobani LLC and Yogi Products. In addition to these competitors, in each of our categories we compete with many regional and small, local niche brands. Given limited retailer shelf space and merchandising events, competitors actively support their respective brands with marketing, advertising and promotional spending. In addition, most retailers market similar items under their own private label, which compete for the same shelf space.
Competitive factors in the packaged foods industry include product quality and taste, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety, interesting or unique product names, product packaging and package design, shelf space, reputation, price, advertising, promotion and nutritional claims. 
Trademarks
We believe that brand awareness is a significant component in a consumer’s decision to purchase one product over another in highly competitive consumer products industries. We generally register our trademarks and brand names in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom and/or other foreign countries depending on the area of distribution of the applicable products, and we intend to keep these filings current and seek protection for new trademarks to the extent consistent with business needs. We also copyright certain of our artwork and package designs. We own registered trademarks for our principal products, including Alba Botanica®, Avalon Organics®, Celestial Seasonings®, Cully & Sully®, Earth’s Best®, Ella’s Kitchen®, Frank Cooper’s®, Gale’s®, Garden of Eatin’®, Hain Pure Foods®, Hartley’s®, Health Valley®, JASON®, Joya®, Lima®, Live Clean®, MaraNatha®, Natumi®, New Covent Garden Soup Co.®, Queen Helene®, Robertson’s®, Sensible Portions®, Spectrum®, Sun-Pat®, Terra®, The Greek Gods®, Yorkshire Provender® and Yves Veggie Cuisine®. We also have registered trademarks for many of our best-selling Celestial Seasonings teas, including Country Peach Passion®, Lemon Zinger®, Mandarin Orange Spice®, Raspberry Zinger®, Red Zinger®, Sleepytime®, Tension Tamer® and Wild Berry Zinger®.
We also market products under brands licensed under trademark license agreements, including Linda McCartney’s®, Rose’s®, the Sesame Street name and logo and other Sesame Workshop intellectual property on certain of our Earth’s Best® products, as well as the Paddington Bear image on certain of our Robertson’s® products.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulations in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities. In the United States, the federal agencies governing the manufacture, marketing and distribution of our products include, among others, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). Under various statutes, these agencies prescribe and establish, among other things, the requirements and standards for quality, safety and representation of our products to the consumer in labeling and advertising.
Internationally, we are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products, including the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Canada and the European Food Safety Authority which supports the European Commission, as well as individual country, province, state and local regulations.
Quality Control
We utilize a comprehensive food safety and quality management program, which employs strict manufacturing procedures, expert technical knowledge on food safety science, employee training, ongoing process innovation, use of quality ingredients and both internal and independent auditing. 
In the United States, each of our own food manufacturing facilities has a Food Safety Plan (“FSP”), which focuses on preventing food safety risks and is compliant with the requirements set forth under the Food Safety and Modernization Act (“FSMA”). In addition, each such facility has at least one Preventive Controls Qualified Individual (“PCQI”) who has successfully completed training in the development and application of risk-based preventive controls at least equivalent to that received under a standardized curriculum recognized by the FDA. 
Substantially all of our Hain-owned manufacturing sites and a significant number of our co-packers are certified against a standard recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”) including Safe Quality Foods (“SQF”) and British Retail 
Consortium (“BRC”). These standards are integrated food safety and quality management protocols designed specifically for the food sector and offer a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality. Certification provides an independent and external validation that a product, process or service complies with applicable regulations and standards.
In addition to third-party inspections of our co-packers, we have instituted audits to address topics such as allergen control; ingredient, packaging and product specifications; and sanitation. Under FSMA, each of our contract manufacturers is required to have a FSP, a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plant (“HACCP”) plan or a hazard analysis critical control points plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards.
Independent Certification
In the United States, our organic products are certified in accordance with the USDA’s National Organic Program through Quality Assurance International (“QAI”), a third-party certifying agency. For products marketed as organic outside of the United States, we use accredited certifying agencies to ensure compliance with country-specific government regulations for selling organic products or reciprocity, where available.
Many of our products are certified kosher under the supervision of accredited agencies including The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations and “KOF-K” Kosher Supervision.
We also work with other non-governmental organizations such as NSF International, which developed the NSF/ANSI 305 Standard for Personal Care Products Containing Organic Ingredients and provides third-party certification through QAI for our personal care products. In addition, we work with other nongovernmental organizations such as the Gluten Free Intolerance Group, Fair Trade USA, Environmental Working Group, The Skin Cancer Foundation, Leaping Bunny, The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Non-GMO Project.
Currently all of our Hain-owned food facilities are GFSI compliant and audited by external certification bodies. When including our co-manufacturers’ facilities, over 98% of our food facilities have achieved a GFSI certification.
