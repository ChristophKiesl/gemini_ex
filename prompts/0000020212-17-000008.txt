ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

A.    Introduction
Churchill Downs Incorporated (the "Company", "we", "us", "our") is an industry-leading racing, gaming and online entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event - The Kentucky Derby. We are a leader in brick-and-mortar casino gaming with approximately 9,030 gaming positions in seven states, and we are the largest, legal mobile and online platform for betting on horseracing in the United States. We are also one of the world's largest producers and distributors of mobile games. We were organized as a Kentucky corporation in 1928, and our principal executive offices are located in Louisville, Kentucky.
B.    Business Segments
We manage our operations through six operating segments: Racing, Casinos, TwinSpires, Big Fish Games, Other Investments and Corporate. Financial information about these segments is set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this report.  Further discussion of financial results by operating segment is provided in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained within this report.
Racing Segment
Our Racing segment includes our four racetracks: Churchill Downs Racetrack ("Churchill Downs"), Arlington International Race Course ("Arlington"), Fair Grounds Race Course ("Fair Grounds") and Calder Race Course ("Calder"). We conduct live horseracing at Churchill Downs, Arlington and Fair Grounds. On July 1, 2014, we entered into a racing services agreement with The Stronach Group ("TSG") to allow Gulfstream Park to manage and operate Calder through December 31, 2020.
Our racing revenue includes commissions on pari-mutuel wagering at our racetracks and off-track betting facilities ("OTBs") plus simulcast host fees earned from other wagering sites. In addition, ancillary revenue generated by the pari-mutuel facilities includes admissions, sponsorships and licensing rights, and food and beverage sales. Racing revenue and income are influenced by our racing calendar. Racing dates are generally approved annually by the respective state racing authorities. Therefore, racing revenue and operating results for any interim quarter are not generally indicative of the revenue and operating results for the year. The majority of our live racing revenue occurs during the second quarter with the running of the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. 
Churchill Downs, Arlington, Fair Grounds, our ten OTBs in Illinois and twelve OTBs in Louisiana offer year-round simulcast wagering. Gulfstream Park took over operations of Calder’s simulcast wagering beginning July 1, 2014. The OTBs accept wagers on races at the respective racetrack or on races simulcast from other locations.
We generate a significant portion of our pari-mutuel wagering revenue by sending signals of races from our racetracks to other facilities and businesses ("export") and receiving signals from other racetracks ("import"). Revenue is earned through pari-mutuel wagering on signals that we both import and export. 
Churchill Downs
Churchill Downs is located in Louisville, Kentucky and is an internationally known thoroughbred racing operation best known as the home of the iconic Kentucky Derby. We have conducted thoroughbred racing continuously at Churchill Downs since 1875. The Kentucky Derby is the longest continuously held annual sporting event in the United States and is the first race of the annual series of races for 3-year old thoroughbreds known as the Triple Crown. Our history of record attendance, increasing wagering and television viewership is attractive to presenting sponsors and contributed to the seventh consecutive year of earnings growth in 2016. We conducted 74 live race days in 2014, 70 in 2015 and 70 in 2016. We anticipate having 70 live race days in 2017.
In 2002, as part of the financing of improvements to the Churchill Downs facility, we transferred title of the Churchill Downs facility to the City of Louisville, Kentucky and leased back the facility. Subject to the terms of the lease, we can re-acquire the facility at any time for $1.00.
The facility consists of approximately 147 acres of land with a one-mile dirt track, a seven-eighths (7/8) mile turf track, a grandstand, luxury suites and a stabling area. The facility accommodates approximately 59,000 patrons in our clubhouse, grandstand, Jockey Club Suites, Finish Line Suites, Turf Club, Grandstand Terrace, Rooftop Garden and Mansion. We have a saddling paddock, accommodations for groups and special events and parking areas for the public. Our racetrack also has permanent lighting in order to accommodate night races. The stable area has barns sufficient to accommodate approximately 1,400 horses and a 114-room dormitory for backstretch personnel. The Churchill Downs facility also includes a simulcast wagering facility.
We have continued to invest in the facility to enhance the experience of our customers. During 2014, we completed the installation of a 15,224 square-foot, state of the art, high-definition video board that provides an enhanced viewing experience for patrons.

We also created The Mansion, which provides premium accommodations for 298 guests. We also opened the Grandstand Terrace and Rooftop Garden, which together added 2,400 new seats, wagering windows, and food and beverage offerings.
During the second quarter of 2015, we opened our new winner’s circle suites and a courtyard. The winner’s circle suites include 20 private, open-air suites reserved specifically for Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby horsemen. The courtyard is a spacious lawn area in front of the winner’s circle suites. 
During the second quarter of 2016, we finalized our $19.0 million renovation of the Turf Club and other premium areas. The Turf Club is an exclusive, members-only lounge and dining room located in the clubhouse section of Churchill Downs, directly overlooking the racetrack's finish line.
In October 2016, we announced a $16.0 million renovation to modernize 95,000 square feet of the second floor clubhouse. The capital project is designed to improve the venue circulation and service as well as to enhance food and beverage offerings. The project is expected to be completed prior to the 2017 Kentucky Derby.
In November 2016, we announced a $37.0 million capital project that will deliver more than 1,800 new seats for the 2018 Kentucky Derby through the addition of 36 new luxury starting gate suites and interior dining tables.
We also provide additional stabling and training facilities sufficient to accommodate 500 horses and a three-quarter (3/4) mile dirt track at a facility known as Trackside Louisville, which is located approximately five miles from the racetrack facility.
Arlington
The Arlington racetrack is located in Arlington Heights, Illinois and is a thoroughbred racing operation with ten OTBs. The Arlington racetrack hosts a significant stakes race, the Arlington Million. We conducted 89 live race days in 2014, 77 in 2015 and 74 in 2016. We anticipate having 71 live race days in 2017.
The racetrack sits on 336 acres, has a one and one-eighth (1 1/8) mile synthetic track, a one-mile turf track and a five-eighths (5/8) mile training track. The facility includes a clubhouse, grandstand and suite seating for approximately 7,500 persons, and food and beverage facilities. The stable area can accommodate 2,200 horses and has 546 rooms of temporary housing.
Fair Grounds
The Fair Grounds racetrack is located in New Orleans, Louisiana and is a racing operation with twelve OTBs in Louisiana. The Fair Grounds racetrack hosts a significant stakes race, the Louisiana Derby. We conducted 82 thoroughbred live race days in 2014, 83 in 2015 and 78 in 2016. We anticipate having 81 thoroughbred live race days in 2017. We conducted 12 quarter horse live race days in 2014, 10 in 2015 and 10 in 2016. We anticipate having 10 quarter horse live race days in 2017. 
The Fair Grounds facility consists of approximately 145 acres of land, a one-mile dirt track, a seven-eighths (7/8) mile turf track, a grandstand and a stabling area. The facility includes clubhouse and grandstand seating for approximately 5,000 persons, a general admissions area and food and beverage facilities. The stable area consists of barns that can accommodate 1,897 horses and living quarters for 132 people.
Calder
Calder is located in Miami Gardens, Florida and is adjacent to Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins. Calder is a thoroughbred racing facility that consists of approximately 170 acres of land with a one-mile dirt track, 7/8-mile turf track, barns and stabling facilities. 
On July 1, 2014, we finalized an agreement with TSG that expires on December 31, 2020 under which we permit TSG to operate and manage Calder’s racetrack and certain other racing and training facilities and to provide live horseracing under Calder’s racing permits. During the term of the agreement, TSG pays Calder a racing services fee and is responsible for the direct and indirect costs of maintaining the racing premises, including the training facilities and applicable barns, and TSG receives the associated revenue from the operation. 
In late 2014 and into 2015, we assessed potential alternative uses of the Calder property that are not associated with the TSG lease agreement. Based on our analysis, we razed the barns that were not associated with the TSG agreement and commenced the demolition of the grandstand and certain ancillary facilities. The Company recognized Calder exit costs of $2.5 million in 2016, $13.9 million in 2015 and $2.3 million in 2014 related to demolition costs for the removal of the grandstand. The Calder exit costs recognized in 2015 included a non-cash impairment charge of $12.7 million to reduce the net book value of the grandstand assets to zero.
On November 8, 2016, we completed the sale of 61 acres of excess, undeveloped land at Calder for which we received total proceeds of $25.6 million.

Saratoga Casino Holdings LLC Equity Investment
On October 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of a 25% equity investment in SCH which owns Saratoga Casino and Raceway ("Saratoga's New York facility") in Saratoga Springs, New York, for $24.5 million from Saratoga Harness Racing, Inc. ("SHRI"). Saratoga's New York facility has a casino with approximately 1,700 VLT machines, a 1/2-mile harness racetrack with a racing simulcast center and three dining facilities. Saratoga's New York facility has a 50% interest in a joint venture with Delaware North Companies Gaming & Entertainment Inc. ("DNC") to manage the Gideon Putnam Hotel and Resort. We also signed a five-year management agreement with SCH to manage Saratoga's New York facility for which we receive management fee revenue.
On July 6, 2016, Saratoga's New York facility completed a $40.0 million expansion including a 117-room hotel, additional dining facilities and a 3,000 square-foot multi-functional event space.

6

Our equity gain or loss from Saratoga's New York facility and Saratoga's Colorado facility are reported as Saratoga (collectively, "Saratoga").
Ocean Downs Equity Investment
In August 2016, we signed a limited liability company operating agreement with SCH, with each entity having a 50% interest, and formed Old Bay Gaming and Racing LLC (“Old Bay”). The Old Bay agreement provides both the Company and SCH equal participating rights, and both entities must consent to Old Bay’s operating, investing and financing decisions.
On January 3, 2017, Old Bay acquired all of the equity interests of Ocean Enterprise 589 LLC, Ocean Downs LLC and Racing Services LLC (collectively, “Ocean Downs”). Ocean Downs, located near Ocean City, Maryland, owns and operates VLTs at the Casino at Ocean Downs and conducts harness racing at Ocean Downs Racetrack. The Company’s 25% interest in SCH provides an additional 12.5% interest, resulting in an effective 62.5% interest in Ocean Downs. Since both the Company and SCH have participating rights and both must consent to Old Bay’s operating, investing and financing decisions, the Company will account for Ocean Downs using the equity method of accounting.
The casino at Ocean Downs has approximately 800 VLTs and two dining facilities. The racetrack at Ocean Downs conducted 48 days in 2014, 48 days in 2015 and 47 days of live harness racing in 2016. The racetrack at Ocean Downs expects to conduct 48 days of live harness racing in 2017.
TwinSpires Segment
Our TwinSpires segment includes TwinSpires.com, Fair Grounds Account Wagering ("FAW"), Velocity, Churchill Downs Interactive Gaming ("I-Gaming"), Bluff Media ("Bluff") and Bloodstock Research Information Services ("BRIS"). 
TwinSpires.com is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky and operates our mobile and online wagering business, which is our platform for betting on horseracing. We are the country’s largest legal online gaming platform in the U.S. TwinSpires accepts pari-mutuel wagers from customers residing in certain states who establish and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device (through a browser or the TwinSpires mobile app) or through the Internet at www.twinspires.com. Our business is licensed as a multi-jurisdictional simulcasting and interactive wagering hub in the state of Oregon. We offer our customers streaming video of live horse races, as well as replays, and an assortment of racing and handicapping information. In addition, we provide technology services to third parties, and we earn commissions from white label advance deposit wagering products and services. Under these arrangements, we typically provide an advance deposit wagering platform and related operational services while the third party typically provides a brand name, marketing and limited customer functions. We believe that TwinSpires.com is a key component to our growth, and our gaming platform positions us to be a continued market leader in online gaming.
Our FAW business is a mobile and online wagering business licensed in the state of Louisiana that is operated by Fair Grounds Race Course for Louisiana residents through a contractual agreement with TwinSpires.com. 
Velocity is a mobile and online wagering business licensed under TwinSpires.com, which focuses on high dollar wagering international customers. During December 2016, we completed the transition of Velocity customers to the TwinSpires.com Oregon license. 
I-Gaming is our Internet real-money gaming operation. During May 2015, I-Gaming entered into an agreement with a licensed card room operator to provide Internet-based interactive gaming services within California, should enabling legislation be enacted that would permit such activities. The term of the agreement commences after enabling legislation and upon the acceptance of the first customer wager and will then continue for a ten-year period. Under the agreement, I-Gaming and the licensed operator will jointly provide a platform for operations, obtain and maintain required licenses and regulatory approvals, and operate Internet-based interactive gaming services that will be marketed to California residents. These Internet-based interactive gaming services may include poker and other real-money gaming activities. At this time, it is difficult to assess whether this legislation will be enacted into law and the effect it would have on our business.
Bluff operated a multimedia poker periodical (BLUFF Magazine and BluffMagazine.com), maintained a comprehensive online database (ThePokerDB) that tracked and ranked the performance of poker players and tournaments, and provided various other news and content forums. We acquired Bluff in February 2012, and we ceased operations of BLUFF Magazine in July 2015.
BRIS is a data service provider with one of the world’s largest computerized databases of handicapping and pedigree information for the thoroughbred horse industry. We provide special reports, statistical information, handicapping information, pedigrees and other data through our websites Brisnet.com and TwinSpires.com.
HRTV, LLC ("HRTV") was an equity investment in a horseracing television channel. We divested HRTV on January 2, 2015.

Big Fish Games Segment
On December 16, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Big Fish Games, Inc. ("Big Fish Games"), a global producer and distributor of social casino, casual and mid-core free-to-play and premium paid games for PC, Mac and mobile devices. Big Fish Games is headquartered in Seattle, Washington and has locations in Oakland, California and Luxembourg, with approximately 700 employees.
We utilize a portfolio approach to game development and have six internal studios with distinct production strategies as well as a large network of third-party developers to supplement our internal game production capabilities. We are a major producer of content and a direct-to-consumer, analytics-focused marketer and distributor of content across multiple platforms, including PC, Mac and mobile (including iOS and Android devices). We focus on delivering high quality game play and scaling these games to large audiences. When we release new games, we have an advanced marketing and analytic platform that allows us to quickly reach a broad game audience while leveraging a positive spread between the cost to acquire users and the expected net revenue from those users.
We have distributed more than 2.8 billion games to customers in 150 countries and are currently ranked as the seventh largest mobile publisher by combined iOS and Android sales in the U.S. based on 2016 gross revenue. The business operates in three business lines: 1) social casino, 2) casual and mid-core free-to-play and 3) premium paid games. 
Social Casino Games
Social casino games are free to download through PC, Mac and mobile devices with a free-to-play business model. Monetization occurs through the consumer purchase of in-app virtual currency to enhance the game-playing experience. We view Big Fish Casino as a social game platform within a single app that includes multiple casino-style games such as blackjack, poker, slots, craps and roulette. Big Fish Casino is consistently a top-five social casino title on iOS and Google Play app stores based on gross revenue. Jackpot City Slots and Vegas Party Slots are other examples of our social casino games.
Casual and Mid-core Free-to-play Games
Casual and mid-core free-to-play games are also free to download through PC, Mac and mobile devices. Casual games consist of non-casino game genres such as match three, puzzle, hidden object and solitaire. Mid-core free-to-play games include non-casino game genres such as simulation, role-playing, adventure, collectible card and strategy. These games are monetized through the consumer purchase of in-app virtual currency which players can use to buy virtual items to enhance the game-playing experience. Over time, we have experienced a significant increase in our monthly average users largely due to the continued growth of our mobile free-to-play offerings. Gummy Drop! and Fairway Solitaire are examples of our casual free-to-play games and Dungeon Boss is an example of our mid-core free-to-play games.
Premium Paid Games
Premium paid games are those where customers pay a single price upfront to download a game on their PC, Mac and mobile devices. There is no further monetization through in-game purchases. The games tend to be linear in nature and have a distinct beginning, middle and end.
Other Investments Segment
Our Other Investments Segment includes United Tote, Capital View Casino & Resort Joint Venture ("Capital View") and our other minor investments.
United Tote
Our subsidiaries, United Tote Company and United Tote Canada (collectively "United Tote"), manufacture and operate pari-mutuel wagering systems for racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses. United Tote provides totalisator services which accumulate wagers, record sales, calculate payoffs and display wagering data to patrons who wager on horse races. United Tote has contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of third-party racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses and also provides these services at many of our facilities.
Capital View Casino & Resort Joint Venture
Capital View is a 50% joint venture with SHRI that unsuccessfully bid on the development of a destination casino and resort in the Capital Region of New York.
Corporate Segment
Our Corporate segment includes miscellaneous and other revenue, compensation expense, professional fees and other general and administrative expense not allocated to our other operating segments.

C.    Competition
Overview
We operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than ours. The industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports, fantasy sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Internet-based interactive gaming and wagering, both legal and illegal, is growing rapidly and we anticipate competition in this area will become more intense as new Internet-based ventures enter the industry and as state and federal regulations on Internet-based activities are clarified. Additionally, our brick-and-mortar casinos compete with traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
Legalized gambling is currently permitted in various forms in many states and Canada. Other jurisdictions could legalize gambling in the future, and established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion of existing gaming operations. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing or gaming operations, such gaming operations could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Racing
In 2016, approximately 42,000 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the United States. Of these races, we hosted 2,073 races, or 4.9% of the total. As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races. As a racetrack operator, we also compete for horses with other racetracks running live racing meets at or near the same time as our races. Our ability to compete is substantially dependent on the racing calendar, number of horses racing and purse sizes. In recent years, competition has increased as more states legalize gaming and allow slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions. Over 89 percent of pari-mutuel handle is bet at off-track locations, either at other racetracks, OTBs, casinos, or through mobile and online wagering channels. As a content distributor, we compete for these dollars to be wagered at our racetracks, OTBs, casinos and via our mobile and online wagering business.
Churchill Downs
Churchill Downs faces competition from freestanding casinos and racetracks that are combined with casinos ("racinos") in Indiana, West Virginia and Ohio. In Indiana, these casinos include Horseshoe Indiana, in Elizabeth, Indiana; Belterra Casino in Florence, Indiana and French Lick Resort in French Lick, Indiana. In Indiana, there are two racinos: Hoosier Park which operates 2,000 slot machines, and Indiana Grand Racing & Casino, which operates 2,200 slot machines. In West Virginia, there is one racino, Mountaineer Casino Racetrack and Resort. In Ohio, seven racetracks offer VLT facilities. 
In New York, Aqueduct Racetrack has a gaming facility with more than 5,400 VLTs and electronic table games. As a result of the addition of gaming activities, New York purse payments at each of the three New York racetracks were greatly enhanced compared to historical levels. 
These developments may result in Indiana, Ohio and New York racetracks attracting horses that would otherwise race at Kentucky racetracks, including Churchill Downs, thus negatively affecting the number of starters that, in turn, may have a negative effect on handle. 
Arlington 
Arlington competes in the Chicago market against a variety of entertainment options. In addition to other racetracks in the area such as Hawthorne Race Course, there are ten riverboat casino operations that draw from the Chicago market including Rivers Casino, in Des Plaines, Illinois. Additionally, Native American gaming operations in Wisconsin may also adversely affect Arlington.
The Video Gaming Act was enacted in July 2009, authorizing the placement of up to five Video Gaming Terminals ("VGTs") in licensed retail establishments, truck stops, and veteran and fraternal establishments. There are currently over 22,000 VGTs distributed among more than 5,000 establishments throughout Illinois.
Fair Grounds
Fair Grounds competes in Louisiana in both thoroughbred and quarter horse racing with Louisiana Downs, Evangeline Downs, Harrah's Louisiana Downs and Delta Downs as well as with other southern state racetracks, including Gulfstream Park in Florida and Oaklawn Park in Arkansas.
Casinos
Oxford
Oxford competes with Hollywood Casino in Bangor, Maine. Oxford also competes with Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts, which opened in June 2015. Two other casinos are expected to open in Massachusetts in the future.
9

Riverwalk
Riverwalk competes in the Vicksburg, Mississippi area and is one of four casinos in the local market. Our principal local competitors are Ameristar Casino, Lady Luck Casino and WaterView Casino & Hotel. In addition, Riverwalk faces regional competition from Magnolia Bluff Casino and the Pearl River Resort in Mississippi.
Harlow’s
Harlow’s competes in Greenville, Mississippi with a variety of regional riverboat and land-based casinos. Our primary local competitor is Trop Casino, which reopened its renovated property during October 2014. Harlow’s also faces regional competition from a casino in Lula, Mississippi, eight casinos in Tunica, Mississippi and two casinos in Arkansas.
The Mississippi Gaming Control Act does not limit the number of licenses that may be granted.
Calder Casino
Calder Casino competes with seven pari-mutuel casinos as well as four Indian-owned casinos, all of which are located in Miami-Dade or Broward County, Florida. We also face competition from a large number of cruise ship operators in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. Native American casinos offer a variety of table games and are taxed at lower rates and therefore, are generally able to spend more money marketing their facilities to consumers.
Fair Grounds Slots and Video Services, LLC
Fair Grounds Slots competes in the New Orleans, Louisiana area with two riverboat casinos and Harrah’s, which is the largest, closest and only land-based casino competitor to Fair Grounds. Fair Grounds Slots faces significant gambling competition along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Fair Grounds Slots and VSI also compete with video poker operations located at various OTBs, truck stops and restaurants in the area. In 2015, Fair Grounds Slots was adversely impacted by a smoking ban in Orleans Parish which enhanced competition with properties outside of Orleans Parish.
MVG
MVG competes with Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, a VLT facility in Dayton, Ohio and JACK Cincinnati, a slot machine and table games casino in Cincinnati, Ohio. MVG also faces regional competition from three casinos in Indiana and two other gaming properties in Columbus, Ohio.
Saratoga 
Saratoga's New York facility competes with Rivers Casino, a new casino in Schenectady, New York, which opened in February 2017. Saratoga's Colorado facility competes in Black Hawk, Colorado with a variety of casinos including Ameristar Casino, Isle of Capri Hotel & Casino and The Lodge & Hotel at Black Hawk, all of which offer hotel accommodations, slot machines and poker and other table games.
Ocean Downs
Ocean Downs competes with Harrington Raceway & Casino, in Harrington Delaware, which has slot machines, table games, simulcasting and live racing. Ocean Downs also faces competition from Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, in Dover, Delaware, which offers slot machines, table games, hotel accommodations and a spa facility.
TwinSpires
TwinSpires.com competes with other mobile and online wagering businesses for both customers and racing content, and it also competes with online gaming sites. Our competitors include Betfair Limited (d/b/a TVG), The Stronach Group (d/b/a XpressBet), Premier Turf Club, Lien Games (d/b/a BetAmerica), AmWest Entertainment, The New York Racing Association (d/b/a NYRA Rewards), Connecticut OTB, Penn National Gaming Inc. and Racing2Day LLC.
Our BRIS business competes with companies such as Equibase and the Daily Racing Form.
Big Fish Games
Big Fish Games faces significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players with other game developers on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and access to distribution channels.
 We believe we compete favorably on these factors; however, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Other developers and distributors of social casino, casual and mid-core free-to-play and premium paid games could develop more compelling content that competes with our games and adversely affects our ability to attract and retain players and their entertainment time. These competitors, including companies of which we may not be currently aware, may take advantage of social networks or access to a larger user base to grow their networks rapidly and virally.
10

Our social casino games compete in a rapidly evolving market against an increasing number of competitors, including Caesars Interactive, Zynga and IGT. Our casual and mid-core free-to-play game customers may also play other games on PCs, Macs, mobile devices and console devices, and some of these games may include unique features that our games do not have. Given the open nature of the development and distribution of games for mobile devices, we compete with a vast number of developers and distributors who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. It has been estimated that more than 2.2 million applications, including more than 488,000 active games, were available on Apple’s U.S. App Store as of December 31, 2016. The proliferation of titles potentially makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for customers who download and purchase content for their devices without substantially increasing our marketing and other development and distribution costs.
Other Investments
In North America, United Tote competes primarily with Sportech and AmTote International, Inc. Our competition outside of North America is very fragmented.
D.    Governmental Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our businesses. The ownership, operation and management of our racing operations, our casino operations, TwinSpires and Big Fish Games are subject to regulation under the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The ownership, operation and management of our segments are also subject to legislative actions at both the federal and state level.
Racing Regulations
Horseracing is a highly regulated industry. In the U.S., individual states control the operations of racetracks located within their respective jurisdictions with the intent of, among other things, protecting the public from unfair and illegal gambling practices, generating tax revenue, licensing racetracks and operators and preventing organized crime from being involved in the industry. Although the specific form may vary, states that regulate horseracing generally do so through a horseracing commission or other gambling regulatory authority. In general, regulatory authorities perform background checks on all racetrack owners prior to granting them the necessary operating licenses. Horse owners, trainers, jockeys, drivers, stewards, judges and backstretch personnel are also subject to licensing by governmental authorities. State regulation of horse races extends to virtually every aspect of racing and usually extends to details such as the presence and placement of specific race officials, including timers, placing judges, starters and patrol judges. We currently satisfy the applicable licensing requirements of the racing and gambling regulatory authorities in each state where we maintain racetracks or pari-mutuel operations and/or businesses.
The total number of days on which each racetrack conducts live thoroughbred racing fluctuates annually according to each calendar year and the determination of applicable regulatory authorities.
In the United States, interstate pari-mutuel wagering on horseracing is subject to the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 ("IHA"), as amended in 2000. Through the IHA, racetracks can commingle wagers from different racetracks and wagering facilities and broadcast horseracing events to other licensed establishments.
Kentucky
Horseracing tracks in Kentucky are subject to the licensing and regulation of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission ("KHRC"). The KHRC is responsible for overseeing horseracing and regulating the state equine industry. Licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing meets, to participate in simulcasting and to accept advance deposit wagers from Kentucky residents are approved annually by the KHRC based upon applications submitted by the racetracks in Kentucky. To some extent, Churchill Downs competes with other racetracks in Kentucky for the award of racing dates; however, the KHRC is required by state law to consider and seek to preserve each racetrack’s usual and customary live racing dates.
Illinois
In Illinois, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Illinois Racing Board ("IRB"). In September 2016, the IRB appointed Arlington the dark host track in Illinois for 61 simulcast host days during 2017, a decrease of 3 days compared to 2016.  In addition, Arlington was awarded 154 live host days for 2017, an increase of 2 days as compared to 2016.  In total, Arlington was awarded 215 live and dark host days in 2017, a decrease of 1 day as compared to 2016.
On May 26, 2016, the Illinois legislature passed a bill to reauthorize advance deposit wagering though December 21, 2018 and continued incremental surcharges on winning wagers. The bill was signed by the Governor of Illinois in August 2016.
Florida
In Florida, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation's Division of Pari-mutuel Wagering ("DPW"). The DPW is responsible for overseeing 
11

the network of state offices located at every pari-mutuel wagering facility, as well as issuing the permits necessary to operate a pari-mutuel wagering facility. The DPW also issues annual licenses for thoroughbred, standardbred and quarter horse races but does not approve the specific live race days.
Louisiana
In Louisiana, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Louisiana State Racing Commission ("LSRC"). The LSRC is responsible for overseeing the awarding of licenses for the conduct of live racing meets, the conduct of thoroughbred horseracing, the types of wagering that may be offered by pari-mutuel facilities and the disposition of revenue generated from wagering. Off-track wagering is also regulated by the LSRC. Louisiana law requires live racing at a licensed racetrack for at least 80 days over a 20 week period each year to maintain the license and to conduct slot operations.
With the addition of slot machines at Fair Grounds, Louisiana law requires live quarter horseracing to be conducted at the racetrack. We conducted quarter horseracing at Fair Grounds for 12 days in 2014, 10 days in 2015 and 10 days in 2016. We expect to conduct quarter horseracing for 10 days in 2017.
In March 2016, during a special session held to address Louisiana’s budget deficit, legislation was passed which temporarily removed the sales tax exemption Fair Grounds qualified for as a pari-mutuel. From April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, Fair Grounds paid the statutory state tax of 4% on all purchases related to racing operations. Effective July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018, Fair Grounds is required to pay a 2% state tax on purchases related to racing operations. During the same special session, the Legislature also added another one percent to the state tax base until July 1, 2018. The sales tax exemption is scheduled to be reinstated July 1, 2018.  The legislation is expected to have an adverse impact on our business.
Casino Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Casino laws are generally designed to protect casino consumers and the viability and integrity of the casino industry. Casino laws may also be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenue derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on casino industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, casino laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the casino industry meet certain standards of character and fitness. In addition, casino laws require casino industry participants to:

• | Ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in casino operations;


• | Establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;


• | Establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;


• | Maintain effective controls over financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue;


• | Maintain systems for reliable record keeping;


• | File periodic reports with casino regulators;


• | Ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value and are arms-length transactions;


• | Establish programs to promote responsible gambling and inform patrons of the availability of help for problem gambling; and


• | Enforce minimum age requirements.

Typically, a state regulatory environment is established by statute and administered by a regulatory agency with broad discretion to regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in casino operations. Among other things, casino authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate:

• | Adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;


• | Interpret and enforce casino laws;


• | Impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties;


• | Review the character and fitness of participants in casino operations and make determinations regarding suitability or qualification for licensure;


• | Grant licenses for participation in casino operations;


• | Collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in casino operations;

12


• | Review and approve transactions, such as acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of casino industry participants, securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants; and


• | Establish and collect fees and taxes.

Any change in the laws or regulations of a casino jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
Gaming laws require us, each of our subsidiaries engaged in casino operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from casino authorities. Licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable. Criteria used in determining whether to grant a license to conduct casino operations, while varying between jurisdictions, generally include consideration of factors such as the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant; the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, including whether the operation is adequately capitalized in the state and exhibits the ability to maintain adequate insurance levels; the quality of the applicant’s casino facilities; the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable state from the operation of the applicant’s casino; the applicant’s practices with respect to minority hiring and training; and the effect on competition and general impact on the community.
In evaluating individual applicants, casino authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates.
Many casino jurisdictions limit the number of licenses granted to operate casinos within the state and some states limit the number of licenses granted to any one casino operator. Licenses under casino laws are generally not transferable without approval. Licenses in most of the jurisdictions in which we conduct casino operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed. The failure to renew any of our licenses could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
In addition to our subsidiaries engaged in casino operations, casino authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with, any of these entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a casino licensee. Our officers, directors and certain key employees must file applications with the casino authorities and may be required to be licensed, qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing for any cause that they deem reasonable. Qualification and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to casino authorities. In addition to casino authorities' ability to deny a license, qualification or finding of suitability, casino authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If one or more casino authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, casino authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
Moreover, in many jurisdictions, certain of our shareholders may be required to undergo a suitability investigation similar to that described above. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to casino authorities, and casino authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Most casino authorities, however, allow an "institutional investor" to apply for a waiver. An "institutional investor" is generally defined as an investor acquiring and holding voting securities in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor, and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a member of our board of directors, any change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations, or those of any of our casino affiliates, or the taking of any other action which casino authorities find to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor generally may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver was granted without once again becoming subject to the foregoing reporting and application obligations.
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised it is required by casino authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Any shareholder found unsuitable or denied a license and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our voting securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable casino authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. Furthermore, we may be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a shareholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: (i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; (ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or (iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable 
13

person to relinquish voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of said voting securities for cash at fair market value.
Violations of Gaming Laws
If we violate applicable casino laws, our casino licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked by casino authorities, and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines. A supervisor or conservator can be appointed by casino authorities to operate our casino properties, or in some jurisdictions, take title to our casino assets in the jurisdiction, and under certain circumstances, income generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable state or states. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. As a result, violations by us of applicable casino laws could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Some casino jurisdictions prohibit certain types of political activity by a casino licensee, its officers, directors and key employees. A violation of such a prohibition may subject the offender to criminal and/or disciplinary action.
Reporting and Record-keeping Requirements
We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information that casino authorities may require. Under federal law, we are required to record and submit detailed reports of currency transactions involving greater than $10,000 at our casinos and racetracks as well as any suspicious activity that may occur at such facilities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines or cessation of operations. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by casino authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to casino authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified casino laws.
Review and Approval of Transactions
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to and in some cases approved by casino authorities. We may not make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain casino authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise are subject to receipt of prior approval of casino authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries must satisfy casino authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. Gaming authorities may also require controlling shareholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
License Fees and Gaming Taxes
We pay substantial license fees and taxes in many jurisdictions in connection with our casino operations which are computed in various ways depending on the type of gambling or activity involved. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable with varying frequency. License fees and taxes are based upon such factors as a percentage of the gross casino revenue received; the number of gambling devices and table games operated; or a one-time fee payable upon the initial receipt of license and fees in connection with the renewal of license. In some jurisdictions, casino tax rates are graduated such that the tax rates increase as gross casino revenue increases. Tax rates are subject to change, sometimes with little notice, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Operational Requirements
In most jurisdictions, we are subject to certain requirements and restrictions on how we must conduct our casino operations. In certain states, we are required to give preference to local suppliers and include minority and women-owned businesses and organized labor in construction projects to the maximum extent practicable. We may be required to give employment preference to minorities, women and in-state residents in certain jurisdictions. Our ability to conduct certain types of games, introduce new games or move existing games within our facilities may be restricted or subject to regulatory review and approval. Some of our operations are subject to restrictions on the number of gaming positions we may have and the maximum wagers allowed to be placed by our customers.
Specific State Casino Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Maine
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Maine is subject to extensive state and local regulation and is subject to licensing and regulatory control by the Maine Gambling Control Board (the "MGCB"). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the MGCB are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: (1) the regulation, supervision and general control over casinos and the ownership and operation of slot machines and table games; (2) the investigation of complaints made regarding casinos; (3) the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting 
14

practices and procedures; (4) the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue and providing for reliable record keeping; and (5) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the MGCB. Changes in Maine laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Maine gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the MGCB could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Potential Expanded Gaming in Maine
In 2016, legislation was filed that would expand gaming locations in the state and allow for entities such as Native American tribes in northern Maine and a harness track in southern Maine to operate casino facilities. The legislative proposals were defeated during the 2016 session. In January 2017, legislation was again filed that will allow Native American tribes to qualify for a casino license. A citizen’s initiative to allow for a York county casino has been certified by the Secretary of State’s office to appear on the November 2017 ballot. If the initiative receives more than 50% of voter approval in November, the measure will become law. Should gaming expansion occur in Maine, it could have an adverse impact on our business. 
Mississippi
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, including the Mississippi Gaming Commission (the "Mississippi Commission"). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Mississippi Commission are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: (1) the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (2) the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures; (3) the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue, providing for reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Mississippi Commission; (4) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; (5) providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees; and (6) ensuring that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Commission. Changes in Mississippi laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Mississippi gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Mississippi Commission could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Florida
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Florida is subject to extensive state and local regulation, primarily by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (the "DBPR"), within the executive branch of Florida’s state government. The DBPR is charged with the regulation of Florida’s pari-mutuel, card room and slot gaming industries, as well as collecting and safeguarding associated revenue due to the state. The DBPR has been designated by the Florida legislature as the state compliance agency with the authority to carry out the state’s oversight responsibilities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the compact between the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the State of Florida. Changes in Florida laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Florida gaming operation. The laws and regulations of Florida are based on policies of maintaining the health, welfare and safety of the general public and protecting the video gaming industry from elements of organized crime, illegal gambling activities and other harmful elements, as well as protecting the public from illegal and unscrupulous gaming to ensure the fair play of devices. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the DBPR could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Potential Seminole Compact and Potential Decoupling in Florida
In December 2015, Florida’s Governor signed a twenty-year Seminole Compact with the Seminole Tribe preserving the Tribe's geographic exclusivity and right to exclusively operate blackjack, craps and roulette games and providing the state with an expected $3.0 billion in additional state revenue over a seven-year period beginning in 2017. The Seminole Compact addresses other issues such as the potential for pari-mutuel operations to add blackjack in a limited fashion as well as the potential for expanded licenses in Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties. The Seminole Compact must be approved by the Florida Legislature. In February 2016, legislation authorizing the Seminole Compact was introduced for consideration, but it has not been ratified.
In January 2017, legislation was filed in the Florida Senate that would allow pari-mutuel racetracks in Miami-Dade and Broward counties to decouple their pari-mutuel and gaming operations. The bill authorizes up to eight additional casino licenses in counties that have approved slot machine gaming through a local referendum and also provides for two additional gaming licenses in Miami-Dade and Broward. The legislation provides for a 10% reduced tax rate on slot machine revenues and permits 24 hour operation for casinos. Under the terms of the proposed bill, the Compact negotiated in 2015 between the Governor and the Seminole Tribe would be ratified. 
15

At this time it is not possible to determine what impact legislation with respect to authorizing the Seminole Compact or decoupling would have on our business.
Louisiana
The manufacture, distribution, servicing and operation of video draw poker devices in Louisiana are subject to the Louisiana Video Draw Poker Devices Control Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The manufacture, distribution, servicing and operation of video poker devices and slot machines are governed by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (the "Louisiana Board") which oversees all licensing for all forms of legalized gaming in Louisiana. The Video Gaming Division and the Slots Gaming Division of the Gaming Enforcement Section of the Office of the State Police within the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (the "Division") performs the video poker and slots gaming investigative functions for the Louisiana Board. The laws and regulations of Louisiana are based on policies of maintaining the health, welfare and safety of the general public and protecting the video gaming industry from elements of organized crime, illegal gambling activities and other harmful elements, as well as protecting the public from illegal and unscrupulous gaming to ensure the fair play of devices. The Louisiana Board also regulates slot machine gaming at racetrack facilities pursuant to the Louisiana Pari-Mutuel Live Racing Facility Economic Redevelopment and Gaming Control Act. Changes in Louisiana laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Louisiana gaming operations. In addition, the LSRC also issues licenses required for Fair Grounds to operate slot machines at the racetrack and video poker devices at its OTBs. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Louisiana Board or the LSRC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
On January 22, 2015, the New Orleans City Council approved a smoking ban in bars and other public places, including casinos, in Orleans Parish which took effect on April 22, 2015. The smoking ban had a negative impact on Fair Grounds Slots which was partially offset by VSI, whose OTB locations are located outside of Orleans Parish.
Ohio
Video Lottery was introduced in the State of Ohio in 2012 when the Governor of Ohio signed Executive Order 2011-22K which authorized the Ohio Lottery Commission ("the OLC") to amend and adopt rules necessary to implement a video lottery program at Ohio’s seven horse racing facilities. The ownership and operation of VLT facilities in the State of Ohio is subject to extensive state and local regulation. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the OLC include 1) regulating the licensing of video lottery sales agents, key gaming employees and VLT manufacturers; 2) collecting and disbursing VLT revenue; and 3) maintaining compliance in regulatory matters. Changes in Ohio laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Ohio gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the OLC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
New York
The ownership and operation of VLT facilities in New York are governed by the New York State Gaming Commission ("NYSGC") under the New York State Lottery for Education Law. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the NYSGC include: 1) regulating the licensing of video lottery gaming agents, principal key gaming employees and VLT manufacturers; 2) collecting and disbursing VLT revenue; and 3) maintaining compliance in regulatory matters. Changes in New York laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our New York gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the NYSGC could have a material impact on our business.
During 2012, the Governor of New York and legislative leaders agreed to legalize casino gaming and seek an amendment to the state constitution that would authorize such gaming and, during 2013, New York voters approved a constitutional amendment authorizing up to seven casinos in the state. As of December 31, 2016, New York has awarded four of the seven casino licenses. After a 7-year exclusivity period, the state may award additional licenses. An expansion of gaming in New York includes incentives for the horse racing industry. At this time, it is not possible to determine the impact casino gaming could have on our business.
Potential New York Interactive Gaming Legislation
In January 2017, legislation was filed that would authorize VLT operators and casino licensees to be eligible for an interactive gaming license. The bill provides that an interactive gaming licensee would be authorized to offer online poker games under a ten-year license. The proposed legislation limits the number of licenses to ten, establishes an initial $10.0 million license fee and establishes a tax rate of 15% of interactive gross gaming revenue. If passed, the legislation could result in a favorable impact to our business.
16

Maryland
In January 2017, legislation was filed that would allow casinos to qualify for a 10% gaming tax reduction on slot machine revenue. In order to qualify for the gaming tax reduction, casinos must purchase or acquire the right to lease all of their VLTs prior to January 1, 2018. If casinos do not purchase or assume the right to lease prior to January 1, 2018, then they will be required to assume ownership or lease the terminals by March 31, 2020 without receiving the full tax reduction.
TwinSpires Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
TwinSpires is licensed in Oregon under a multi-jurisdictional simulcasting and interactive wagering totalisator hub license issued by the Oregon Racing Commission ("ORC") and in accordance with Oregon law. TwinSpires also holds advance deposit wagering licenses in certain other states where required such as California, Illinois, Idaho, Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, Arkansas, New York and Washington. Changes in the form of new legislation or regulatory activity at the state or federal level could adversely impact our mobile and online business.
Pennsylvania
In February 2016, legislation was signed by the Governor which is intended to provide regulatory reform to Pennsylvania’s racing industry.  The legislation includes provisions related to the operation of advance deposit wagering in the state.  Under the terms of the legislation, an initial license fee of $0.5 million and annual renewal fee of $0.1 million would be established.  The previous ten percent tax on wagers would be removed and replaced with a one and one-half percent tax on win, place and show wagers, and a two and one-half percent tax on exotic wagers.  Neither an ADW operator nor a racetrack may accept wagers within thirty-five miles of a racetrack operating a live meet. On September 3, 2016, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania challenging the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania law granting each Pennsylvania race track a local monopoly over all wagers placed by telephone or through the Internet by Pennsylvania residents located within a 35-mile radius of the track, as well as requiring out-of-state advance deposit wagering companies to pay initial and annual license fees.
Big Fish Games Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, sweepstakes and contests. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, or may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that is subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
Some of our games and features are based upon traditional casino games such as slots and table games. We structure and operate these games and features, including Big Fish Casino, Jackpot City Slots and Vegas Party Slots, with the gambling laws in mind and believe that these games and features do not constitute gambling.
E.    Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations which are complex and subject to change, include United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ("CAFO") on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm and sanitary water discharges. CAFO and other water discharge regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of these regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. We may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.
In the ordinary course of our business, we may receive notices from regulatory agencies regarding our compliance with CAFO regulations that may require remediation at our facilities. On December 6, 2013, we received a notice from the EPA regarding alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds. We are currently in discussions with the EPA and United States Department of Justice, and we expect to incur certain capital expenditures to remediate the alleged CAFO non-compliance. These capital expenditures are expected to extend the life of the related Fair Grounds assets.
We also are subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances or petroleum products on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the 
17

contamination were legal at the time they occurred. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such substances may materially adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, the owner of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.
F.    Marks and Internet Properties
We hold numerous state and federal service mark registrations on specific names and designs in various categories including the entertainment business, apparel, paper goods, printed matter, housewares and glass. We license the use of these service marks and derive revenue from such license agreements.
G.    Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 4,000 full-time and part-time employees Company-wide. Due to the seasonal nature of our live racing business, the number of seasonal and part-time persons employed will vary throughout the year.
H.    Available Information
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings, and any amendments to those reports and any other filings that we file with or furnish to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made available free of charge on our website (www.churchilldownsincorporated.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the materials with the SEC and are also available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. These reports may also be obtained from the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549 or by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330.
