Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Glaucoma is a disease of the eye that is typically characterized by structural evidence of optic nerve damage, vision loss and consistently elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP. Our lead product candidate, trabodenoson, is a first-in-class selective adenosine mimetic that we rationally designed to lower IOP by restoring the eye’s natural pressure control mechanism. We developed this molecule to selectively stimulate a particular adenosine subreceptor in the eye with the effect of augmenting the intrinsic function of the eye’s trabecular meshwork, or TM. The TM regulates the pressure inside the eye and is also the main outflow path for the fluid inside of the eye that often builds up pressure in patients with glaucoma. We believe that by restoring the natural function of the TM and this outflow path, rather than changing the fundamental dynamics of pressure regulation in the eye, trabodenoson’s mechanism of action should result in a lower risk of unintended side effects and long term safety issues than other mechanisms of action. Additionally, trabodenoson’s unique mechanism of action in the TM should complement the activity of existing glaucoma therapies that exert their IOP-lowering effects on different parts of the in-flow and out-flow system of the eye.
 Our product pipeline includes trabodenoson monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation, as well as a fixed-dose combination, or FDC, of trabodenoson with latanoprost given once-daily, or QD. We are also evaluating the potential of trabodenoson to slow the loss of vision associated with glaucoma and degenerative retinal diseases. 
 The recently completed Phase 3 pivotal trial, MATrX-1, did not meet its primary endpoint because it did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in absolute IOP from placebo at every single one of the 12 time points comprising the primary endpoint. This was due to a larger than expected treatment effect in the placebo/vehicle group, as compared to both our prior Phase 2 data and a recent meta-analysis examining placebo responses from 10 placebo-controlled trials, which showed a placebo/vehicle result of -2.01 mmHg (Raber, et al). During analysis of the IOP data from the trial, a treatment-by-site interaction was found where a small number of sites (4 sites out of a total of 55) caused an important change in the expected vehicle results. The review of the MATrX-1 data is ongoing and upon completion of all analyses, we plan to request a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first half of 2017 to discuss these findings. 
 Statistically significant results for the primary endpoint of our completed Phase 2 clinical trial, and secondary endpoints of our completed MATrX-1 Phase 3 trial (Daily IOP Change from Diurnal Baseline and Analysis of Responders (subjects whose IOP decreased by >= 5 mmHg from baseline)), indicate that trabodenoson monotherapy has IOP-lowering effects, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
 Our completed Phase 2 trial of trabodenoson co-administered with latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue, or PGA, demonstrated IOP-lowering in patients who have previously had inadequate responses to treatment with latanoprost. These patients represent PGA poor-responders, as evidenced by persistently elevated IOP at levels that typically require the addition of a second drug to further lower IOP.
 Upon successful completion of additional Phase 3 studies, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA for marketing approval of trabodenoson for the treatment of glaucoma in the United States. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, in Europe after filing our NDA for approval of trabodenoson in the United States.
 According to the British Journal of Ophthalmology, there were an estimated 2.8 million Americans with glaucoma in 2010. Once glaucoma develops, it is a chronic condition that requires life-long treatment. PGAs are the most widely prescribed drug class for glaucoma and include the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug, latanoprost. When PGA monotherapy is insufficient to control IOP or is poorly tolerated, non-PGA products, such as beta blockers, alpha agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, are generally used either as an add-on therapy to the PGA or as an alternative monotherapy. Both PGAs and non-PGAs can cause adverse effects in the eye. In addition, non-PGA drugs can have adverse effects in the rest of the body and have been shown to have poor tolerability profiles. As a result, we believe there is a significant unmet need for a treatment that effectively lowers IOP by restoring outflow and the natural pressure control by the TM, that has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, and that works effectively in combination with other treatments.
 Additionally, no existing treatments offer the potential to directly treat the underlying cause of glaucoma associated vision loss: the death of retinal ganglion cells, or RGCs, the nerve tissue in the retina that relays the visual signal to the brain. We believe that a drug with the potential to make these cells more resilient to the stress caused by glaucoma would achieve broad market acceptance as the treatment preferred among patients and physicians.

We own a large patent estate covering a wide range of countries and markets for our current product candidates and have patents and pending patent applications related to trabodenoson pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use for trabodenoson, certain of which can extend patent protection through to 2031 and 2034. If trabodenoson receives marketing approval in the United States, we plan to commercialize it by establishing our own specialty sales force in the United States.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat glaucoma. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Complete clinical development and seek marketing approval for our lead product candidate, trabodenoson monotherapy. In 2012, we completed a Phase 2 trial of trabodenoson monotherapy, which demonstrated statistically significant IOP-lowering and a favorable safety profile. We had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2015 to discuss our Phase 3 program for trabodenoson monotherapy and to confirm the design and endpoints for the Phase 3 pivotal trials. At the meeting, we reached agreement on the design of our initial Phase 3 study, as well as the overall regulatory path for trabodenoson. We completed our initial Phase 3 pivotal trial, MATrX-1, and reported top-line data on January 3, 2017. MATrX-1 did not meet its primary endpoint because it did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in absolute IOP from placebo at every single one of the 12 time points comprising the primary endpoint. The review of the MATrX-1 data is ongoing and upon completion of all analyses, we plan to request a meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2017 to discuss both these findings and the subsequent necessary steps needed to attain marketing approval of trabodenoson monotherapy for the treatment of glaucoma in the United States. If we file an NDA for approval of trabodenoson monotherapy in the United States, we plan to submit an MAA in Europe.

• | Complete clinical development and seek marketing approval of a fixed-dose combination product that includes both trabodenoson and latanoprost. As many as half of glaucoma patients, typically those with more severe disease, need to use two or more glaucoma drugs to sufficiently reduce their IOP. The initial treatment for glaucoma patients is usually the use of a prescription eye drop from the PGA drug class. However, as PGAs are often unable to lower IOP sufficiently to reach the patient’s medically targeted level, non-PGA products are used either as an add-on therapy to the PGA or as an alternative monotherapy in place of PGAs. There are currently no FDC products approved for use in the United States that include a PGA. We intend to formulate and conduct clinical development in order to seek marketing approval for an FDC product that includes both trabodenoson and latanoprost, the best-selling PGA. We believe that the favorable safety and tolerability profile and complementary mechanism of action of trabodenoson could, if approved, make an FDC with latanoprost a highly effective, well-tolerated and more convenient QD regimen for treating glaucoma in patients who have a less functional TM and therefore need additional help lowering their IOP. Our completed Phase 2 trial of trabodenoson co-administered with the PGA, latanoprost, demonstrated IOP-lowering in patients who have previously had inadequate responses to the PGA, latanoprost. These patients represent PGA poor-responders, as evidenced by persistently elevated IOP at levels that typically require the addition of a second drug to further lower IOP.

• | Establish a specialty sales force to maximize the commercial potential of trabodenoson in the United States. We have retained worldwide commercial rights to trabodenoson. If trabodenoson receives marketing approval in the United States, we plan to commercialize it by establishing a glaucoma-focused specialty sales force of approximately 150 people targeting ophthalmologists and optometrists throughout the United States. For markets outside the United States, we intend to explore partnership opportunities through collaboration and licensing arrangements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate the potential of trabodenoson and other assets to slow the loss of vision associated with glaucoma and degenerative retinal diseases or for additional ophthalmic indications. Based on an animal model that indicated trabodenoson’s potential to directly protect RGCs, the nerve tissue in the retina that relays the visual signal to the brain, we plan to conduct clinical trials to measure the rate of vision loss over time, rather than IOP control, in patients treated with trabodenoson. Should the results of these trials be positive, we plan to seek labeling indicative of trabodenoson’s potential to change the course of glaucoma-related vision loss, beyond that of IOP-lowering effect alone. In addition, this effect, if proven, could address the subset of glaucoma patients that do not have high IOPs, but still suffer from vision loss over time. We are also evaluating other potential indications where therapy with trabodenoson may be beneficial. To begin this process, we are conducting pre-clinical trials for optic neuropathies and degenerative retinal diseases. In addition, we are evaluating other preclinical assets in additional ocular indications.

Glaucoma Overview
 Glaucoma is a disease of the eye in which damage to the optic nerve leads to progressive, irreversible vision loss. Its characteristics can include structural evidence of optic nerve damage, vision loss and consistently elevated IOP.
 2

Physiology of the Eye
 The eye is a fibrous sack which must stay “inflated” with a fluid that maintains the eye’s form, known as aqueous humor, at the proper pressure in order to maintain its shape and effectively focus light to the retina where the light stimulus is then relayed to the brain and converted into a visual image. To maintain the eye’s pressure—and therefore its shape—and as a means to provide nutrients to eye tissue, aqueous humor is constantly produced inside the eye by a tissue known as the ciliary body. The ciliary body sits just behind the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. Aqueous humor flows forward through a hole in the center of the iris, called the pupil, and down into the angle defined by the front of the iris and the back of the cornea, which is the clear covering on the front of the eye. This angle is the same angle referred to in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma, or POAG, the most common form of glaucoma. Below is a diagram depicting certain parts of the eye, including the ciliary body, iris and the angle defined by the front of the iris and the back of the cornea:
 

3

In this angle, in front of the outer rim of the iris, is the TM, a natural, pressure-regulating drain. It is here that in a healthy, well-functioning eye, approximately 70% of the aqueous humor exits and flows into a drainage canal known as Schlemm’s canal, which empties back into the venous drainage system. The remaining approximately 30% of the aqueous humor leaves the eye through a secondary pathway called the uveoscleral pathway. The diagram below reflects the TM and the uveoscleral pathway, the two pathways for the aqueous humor to leave the eye.
 

4

Development of High IOP and its Effects on Glaucoma
 In a typical glaucoma patient, there is resistance to drainage of the aqueous fluid (i.e., not enough aqueous humor exits the eye), creating excess pressure and compressing the retina, the layer of tissue covering the inside of the back half of the eye that actually converts light into nerve impulses. For people to “see,” these impulses—the visual signal—must be relayed through the optic nerve back to the brain for processing. The cells in the retina require nutrients and oxygen that are delivered via blood vessels entering and exiting the eye through the same opening as the nerve fibers carrying the visual signal. However, when IOP is too high, it is more difficult to pump blood enriched in oxygen and nutrients into the retina. The diagram below reflects the anatomy of the eye and how elevated IOP can impair the nerve tissue in the retina and the optic nerve head.
 

The deprivation of blood supply to the retina may damage RGCs, the nerve tissue in the retina that relays the visual signal to the brain. These RGCs have long tails called axons that extend back to the brain to carry the visual image. In fact, the optic nerve is nothing more than a bundle of these axons extending to the vision processing center of the brain. When an RGC dies, one of the connections between the retina and the brain is lost, and like most cases when a nerve is damaged or cut—like in a spinal cord injury—there is no known way to repair the damage and, as a result, some portion of vision is permanently lost. Therefore, the root cause of vision loss in glaucoma is not high IOP per se, but the impact of high IOP on the retina, and specifically the RGCs.
 5

Clinical Definition of Glaucoma
 There are two key elements to the clinical definition of glaucoma: structural evidence of optic nerve damage and vision loss. Common risk factors include age, family history, corneal thickness and high IOP, commonly measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. Currently, the only known way to treat glaucoma and slow the progression of vision loss is to reduce IOP. While treatment approaches are based on an assessment of the patient’s risk factors for vision loss, elevated IOP is by far the best understood contributor to development of glaucoma. We believe that the general treatment patterns in the figure below, relative to a patient’s IOP, are typical.
 

The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study, or the OHTS, was a large, randomized academic trial published in 2002 that followed a total of 1,636 participants who initially had no evidence of glaucoma-related damage. The OHTS found that higher IOPs generally indicate a higher risk for progression to glaucoma. An IOP of 10 to 21 mmHg is generally considered in the normal range. Individuals with IOPs greater than 21 and up to 25 mmHg will often not be prescribed drug therapy unless they have evidence of both structural changes and some vision loss, or some combination of these and other risk factors for future vision loss. In fact, the United Kingdom’s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Guidelines, or NICE Guidelines, for the treatment of suspected glaucoma (structural changes but without vision loss) plus elevated IOP, does not recommend treatment of eyes with corneal thickness of 555-590 nm and IOP of 25 mmHg or below. Drug treatment is much more common when patients have IOPs greater than 25 mmHg.
 Glaucoma Market
 According to the British Journal of Ophthalmology, there were an estimated 2.8 million Americans with glaucoma in 2010. According to the Archives of Ophthalmology, that number will reach approximately 3.4 million by 2020. Approximately 120,000 of these patients are suffering from blindness as a result of destruction to their optic nerve. Glaucoma can affect patients of all ages and ethnicities. However, according to the Archives of Ophthalmology, the prevalence rate (the proportion of people in the population that have glaucoma) increases with age. The most significant increases in prevalence rates occur above 55 years of age. The prevalence in the population aged 65 years and younger is approximately twice that of the population 55 years or younger. Glaucoma is a chronic condition with no known cure and as a result patients are typically treated for the rest of their lives. Patients with glaucoma report decreased quality-of-life, difficulties with daily functioning, including driving, and are more likely to report falls and motor vehicle collisions.
 6

According to IMS Health, sales of glaucoma drugs in 2013 were approximately $2.0 billion in the United States and $5.6 billion worldwide and 31.2 million prescriptions were written for glaucoma medications in the United States. According to IMS Health, approximately two-thirds of these prescriptions were for generic drugs, including latanoprost and timolol, which are the top two selling drugs for the treatment of glaucoma. Due to the lack of innovation in medications for glaucoma, most of the drugs used to treat glaucoma are generic drugs. IMS Health projects U.S. sales of glaucoma drugs to be $3.1 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately 54% over 2013 sales.
 Existing Glaucoma Treatments
 The initial treatment for glaucoma patients is typically the use of a prescription eye drop from a class of drugs called PGAs. According to IMS Health, prescriptions for PGAs make up more than half of all prescriptions for glaucoma medications. The PGAs’ primary mechanism of action for treating glaucoma is thought to be increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. A number of adverse effects are known to occur in all drugs in the PGA class and, as a result, these side effects are assumed to be associated with the mechanism of action. Most notable of these side effects is eye redness, or conjunctival hyperemia.
 When PGAs are insufficient to control IOP or are poorly tolerated, non-PGA products are used either as an add-on therapy to the PGA or as an alternative monotherapy in place of a PGA. Non-PGAs can include a beta-blocker, an alpha (adrenergic) agonist or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor alone. FDC products containing these non-PGAs are dominated by beta-blocker combinations, which can take the form of a beta-blocker combined with an alpha agonist (Combigan®), or a beta-blocker combined with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (Cosopt® or generic equivalent). Finally, there is a non-PGA combination (Simbrinza®) which consist solely of an alpha agonist and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Non-PGA drugs generally have poorer tolerability in the eye than PGA drugs, and some have systemic adverse effects that limit the patient population in which they can be used safely. Moreover, their IOP-lowering effect is generally less than that of PGAs and the vast majority of non-PGAs are required to be dosed multiple times daily.

The existing classes of treatment available for glaucoma each have varying mechanisms of action, levels of IOP-lowering, side effects and other adverse effects, as described in the following table.

The chart below illustrates the respective proportions of glaucoma prescriptions issued in 2013 by class, according to IMS Health.
 

Glaucoma Treatments Currently in Development.
 We believe there are currently two leading classes of new drugs in clinical development for glaucoma: Rho kinase inhibitors and adenosine mimetics.
 A Rho kinase inhibitor is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials and is the furthest along of the potential new glaucoma drug therapies: Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s AR-13324. Like with PGAs, conjunctival hyperemia has been reported with the Rho kinase inhibitor class.
 Adenosine mimetics are compounds that mimic or simulate some of the actions or effects of adenosine, a naturally-occurring molecule with many, diverse biologic effects. There are four known subreceptors that are specific to adenosine: A1, A2a, A2b and A3. These subreceptors can cause many effects if stimulated. In the adenosine mimetic group, there are compounds targeting three different adenosine subreceptors: A1, A2a and A3. We believe that A1 selectivity is necessary for optimal IOP-lowering effect. To our knowledge, the two compounds being developed by other companies that were selective for the A2a subreceptor have been discontinued from clinical development for glaucoma. A third compound being developed that we believe targets both the A1 (IOP-lowering) and the A3 (IOP-increasing) subreceptors is still being studied. We believe that because this third compound is dosed orally, it is challenging to isolate its pharmacologic effects solely to the eye. We believe we are the only company to be developing an adenosine mimetic highly selective for the A1 subreceptor for ophthalmic indications.
 Market Opportunity
 Since 1996, there have been no new drug classes approved in the United States for glaucoma. As a result, there are persistent inadequacies in the tools that ophthalmologists use to manage patients with glaucoma. Thus, we believe there is a need for an innovative glaucoma treatment that offers:

• | significant IOP-lowering;
--+--------------------------


• | a favorable safety and tolerability profile;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | a novel mechanism of action that complements existing therapies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | convenient dosing.

Our Solution—Trabodenoson
 Trabodenoson is a first-in-class selective adenosine mimetic that is designed to lower IOP with a mechanism of action that we believe augments the natural function of the TM. In addition, by enhancing a naturally occurring process to make the eye function more like that of a younger, healthier eye, rather than changing the fundamental dynamics of pressure regulation in the eye, we believe there is a lower risk of unintended side effects that could result in safety or tolerability issues in the long term. We believe trabodenoson enhances metabolic activity in the TM, which helps clear the pathway for the aqueous humor, the fluid in the eye, to flow out of the eye, thereby lowering IOP. We believe that trabodenoson’s mechanism of action improves the function of the eye, and that trabodenoson has the potential to be used as a monotherapy in place of current glaucoma treatments. In addition, we expect that trabodenoson’s purported mechanism of action in the TM should complement the activity of all currently-approved glaucoma drugs that work in other ways to lower IOP.
 We believe the following elements of trabodenoson’s product profile will drive its adoption, if approved, in the glaucoma market:
  
• | Meaningful IOP-Lowering. After three months of monotherapy treatment in a Phase 3 clinical trial, MATrX-1, in glaucoma patients who had discontinued any other medications, trabodenoson (500 mcg) lowered IOP by an average of 4.25 mmHg from diurnal baseline. Moreover, daily average IOP reduction was statistically significantly greater than placebo at days 84, 42, and 14, with marginal significance at day 28. MATrX-1 did not meet its primary endpoint because it did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in absolute IOP from placebo at every single one of the 12 time points comprising the primary endpoint. This was due to a larger than expected treatment effect in the placebo/vehicle group, as compared to both our prior Phase 2 data and a recent meta-analysis examining placebo responses from 10 placebo-controlled trials, which showed a placebo/vehicle result of -2.01 mmHg (Raber, et al). During analysis of the IOP data from the trial, a treatment-by-site interaction was found where a small number of sites (4 sites out of a total of 55) caused an important change in the expected vehicle results. The review of the MATrX-1 data is ongoing and upon completion of all analyses, we plan to request a meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2017 to discuss these findings. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable Safety Profile. Prior to MATrX-1, in four completed trabodenoson clinical trials over a wide range of doses, no patients had been withdrawn due to a trabodenoson-related side effect in the eye. In our multiple-dose Phase 3 MATrX-1 monotherapy clinical trial, drug-related dropouts were 1.1 % of patients across all doses tested. Furthermore, in our completed multiple-dose Phase 2 trial of trabodenoson co-administered with latanoprost in a population of PGA poor-responders, there also was no change in the rate of hyperemia from study baseline after four, eight or 12 weeks of treatment. No systemic effects of the drug have been identified, despite rigorous monitoring including cardiac and renal function, when administered as an eye drop. We believe this safety profile could be important in the potential for trabodenoson to become a preferred treatment alternative for patients that experience undesired side effects with existing therapies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unique, Complementary Mechanism of Action. We believe that trabodenoson’s mechanism of action augments a naturally occurring process by clearing the path for aqueous humor outflow in the TM. We expect that this mechanism of action should complement all currently-approved glaucoma drugs which work in other ways to lower IOP, including by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. This complementary mechanism was confirmed in patients already receiving latanoprost therapy in a recently completed multiple-dose Phase 2 trial. In this Phase 2 trial of trabodenoson co-administered with latanoprost in a population of PGA poor-responders, patients on latanoprost experienced an additional 5.8 mmHg IOP lowering from their study baseline and 4.3 mmHg from their diurnal baseline after 12 weeks treatment (eight weeks BID plus four weeks QD). These results make trabodenoson, with its favorable safety profile, a candidate to add to other glaucoma medications when a further reduction of the IOP is desirable.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient Dosing. Current Phase 2 clinical data indicate that QD dosing with trabodenoson in PGA poor-responders is well tolerated and lowers IOP significantly. We believe a QD dosing regimen minimizes the burden on patients to remember to take their medication, thus, we believe, potentially improving compliance with the therapy. If confirmed and approved in our Phase 3 program, QD dosing would make trabodenoson easier to use than most non-PGA products, and trabodenoson’s dosing frequency would match the best-in-class PGAs, which would facilitate an FDC with a PGA that could be dosed QD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that trabodenoson’s IOP-lowering results, complementary mechanism of action, dosing and safety profile make it well suited for use in an FDC with a PGA, which could be a convenient option for patients currently using two or more glaucoma drugs to lower IOP.

Trabodenoson Discovery—Background
 Adenosine is a naturally occurring molecule that has a broad array of biological effects. Its effects are mediated through activity at four known adenosine-specific subreceptors: A1, A2a, A2b and A3. These subreceptors are present throughout the body on the cells of different tissues, and at different concentrations. When adenosine binds and activates these different subreceptors, it can cause many diverse effects.
 In 1995, a study was published in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics describing how adenosine mimetics can lower IOP by activating adenosine A1 subreceptors in rabbits. In 2001, an animal study published by the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine confirmed that stimulation of A1 lowered IOP, but that stimulating A2a or A3 subreceptors increased IOP.
 Our scientists began a rational deconstruction of this complex biology in order to isolate the protective activity of adenosine and to incorporate it into novel therapeutics. Beginning with the structure of adenosine, we created a series of molecules to bind with, and therefore induce the biological effects associated with stimulation of a single adenosine subreceptor. In this way, the undesired biological actions of native adenosine were systematically removed, one by one by eliminating the activity at non-target subreceptors. This rational drug design process relied heavily on our understanding of structure activity relationships, which relate the variation in the structure of the adenosine mimetics and their ability to bind and activate ideally just one adenosine subreceptor. Ultimately, a number of molecules emerged from these efforts with isolated and specialized activity, including some adenosine mimetics that only targeted the A1 subreceptor, leading to the discovery of trabodenoson.
 The high affinity binding of trabodenoson to the A1 subreceptor is shown by the small Ki in the table below, and its selectivity for this IOP-lowering activity is indicated by much higher Ki’s for A2a and A3 receptors where its binding is relatively weak.
 Trabodenoson is a Potent and Selective A1 Adenosine Mimetic
 
 
 | A1 | | A2a | | A3 | Selectivity Ratios
-------------+----------+------+----------+-------+----------+-------------------
Compound | (Ki, nM) | | (Ki, nM) | | (Ki, nM) | A2a/A1 | A3/A1
Trabodenoson | | 0.97 | | 4,690 | | 704 | | 4,835x | 725x

 
Trabodenoson’s key characteristics include:
  
1. | Potency—Ki in single-digit nM range (0.97nM);
---+----------------------------------------------


2. | High Selectivity—over A2a> 1000-fold and A3>500-fold;
---+------------------------------------------------------


3. | Ease of Fat Solubility—allowing corneal penetration so it can reach the TM; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | A high compatibility with the often sensitive tissues in the front of the eye.

 We believe that trabodenoson is the only adenosine mimetic with high selectivity for the single desired target of action, the A1 subreceptor, and that stimulation of this subreceptor in the TM effects a meaningful improvement in the metabolic activity in the TM that helps to clear the pathway for the aqueous humor to flow out of the eye, lowering IOP. This metabolic activity takes the form of an increase or up-regulation of proteases—such as Protease A or MMP-2—that digests and removes accumulated proteins that can block the healthy flow of the aqueous humor out of an eye with glaucoma. This metabolic activity is a naturally occurring or endogenous process that is enhanced by treatment with trabodenoson. We believe this process does not radically change the way the TM controls eye pressure, but rather restores the natural process of pressure control in the TM, which is different from other therapies that decrease aqueous humor production or increase the permeability of the eye to increase outflow.

Product Pipeline
 Our product pipeline includes trabodenoson, as a monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation, as well as an FDC that includes trabodenoson plus latanoprost in an eye drop formulation, which we refer to as our FDC product candidate. We are also evaluating the potential for trabodenoson to directly target optic neuropathies and degenerative retinal diseases. The following table summarizes key information about our product development programs.
 
 Trabodenoson
 Our first product candidate, trabodenoson, is a monotherapy dosed in an eye drop. Our clinical trials have shown that trabodenoson has significant IOP-lowering effects, convenient dosing and a favorable safety profile when compared to the currently available glaucoma treatments, such as PGAs and non-PGAs. MATrX-1 did not meet its primary endpoint because it did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in absolute IOP from placebo at every single one of the 12 time points comprising the primary endpoint.  This was due to a larger than expected treatment effect in the placebo/vehicle group, as compared to both our prior Phase 2 data and a recent meta-analysis examining placebo responses from 10 placebo-controlled trials, which showed a placebo/vehicle result of -2.01 mmHg (Raber, et al). During analysis of the IOP data from the trial, a treatment-by-site interaction was found where a small number of sites (4 sites out of a total of 55) caused an important change in the expected vehicle results. The review of the MATrX-1 data is ongoing and upon completion of all analyses, we plan to request a meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2017 to discuss these findings.
 Trabodenoson-Latanoprost Fixed-Dose Combination
 Our second product candidate is a combination of trabodenoson with a PGA, latanoprost, to create an FDC. As many as half of glaucoma patients, typically those with more severe disease, need to use two or more glaucoma drugs to sufficiently reduce their IOP. The available FDC products increase IOP-lowering but also have unpleasant tolerability challenges in the eye, as well as the adverse effects, safety warnings, precautions and contraindications that the two individually-dosed drugs carry in their FDA-approved package inserts. An FDC product containing a PGA plus a non-PGA has not yet been approved in the United States. We believe that none have gained FDA approval because the modest incremental benefit in IOP-lowering seen when a non-PGA is added to a PGA is too small in the context of the added side effects and clinical risks that come with the combined drugs. In contrast, based on our completed Phase 2 study in which trabodenoson therapy was co-administered with latanoprost, we believe that an FDC containing a PGA and trabodenoson would be well received in the glaucoma market, especially for use in patients with higher IOPs that currently use two or more glaucoma drugs to lower IOP.
 We expect that trabodenoson will not adversely affect the safety profile of latanoprost, or any other currently-approved PGA, because of its favorable safety and tolerability profile from our completed Phase 2 trial in which trabodenoson and latanoprost were co-administered. We believe that trabodenoson’s mechanism for lowering IOP complements the mechanism of action of latanoprost and other PGAs, which work primarily on the secondary uveoscleral outflow, because trabodenoson is believed to act through the TM, the largest aqueous humor outflow path in the eye. In fact, our IOP-lowering studies in cynomolgus monkeys have shown that IOP-lowering is significantly better when the eye is treated with both trabodenoson and latanoprost, as compared to treatment with latanoprost alone. 
 Our completed Phase 2 trial of trabodenoson co-administered with latanoprost also demonstrated IOP-lowering in patients who have previously had inadequate responses to latanoprost. These patients represent PGA poor-responders, as evidenced by persistently elevated IOP at levels that typically require the addition of a second drug to further lower IOP. The safety profile of trabodenoson co-
 12

administered with latanoprost is similar to that of trabodenoson monotherapy. Moreover, trabodenoson had a sufficiently long duration of action, allowing it to be effectively dosed QD in conjunction with latanoprost. Assuming the trabodenoson safety profile remains favorable, a trabodenoson-latanoprost FDC therapy could present a much improved risk/benefit profile over other combinations of currently-approved PGAs and non-PGAs. Currently, a Phase 2 dose-ranging, fixed-dose combination trial investigating combinations of trabodenoson and latanoprost in a single eye drop is ongoing. Results are anticipated in mid-2017.
 Trabodenoson for Optic Neuropathy and Degenerative Retinal Diseases
 The neuroprotective potential of trabodenoson is supported by the basic biology of adenosine, which has shown that the stimulation of the A1 receptor can protect tissues of the central nervous system. A pre-clinical study of the impact of high IOP on RGCs showed that trabodenoson could protect this key population of cells in the retina that, when lost, result in the irreversible vision loss associated with glaucoma. While we have not yet conducted a formal program of studies to prove neuroprotection, we plan to study the potential of trabodenoson monotherapy and our FDC product candidate to slow the loss of vision significantly more than attributable to IOP lowering alone, either in glaucoma patients or in other rarer forms of optic neuropathies.
Clinical Data and Development Strategy
 Our Phase 3 program for trabodenoson as a monotherapy incorporates the FDA-acceptable clinical endpoint of IOP, in studies with three months of treatment. We had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2015 to discuss our Phase 3 program for trabodenoson monotherapy, and to confirm the design and endpoints for the Phase 3 pivotal trials. At the meeting, we reached agreement on the design for our initial Phase 3 study, as well as the overall regulatory path for trabodenoson. The trial design for the initial Phase 3 study was a five-arm superiority trial including three doses of trabodenoson. The primary endpoint of the study was IOP, determined at four timepoints during the day, after 4, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The IOP of the trabodenoson treated subjects was statistically compared to those of placebo treated subjects. A timolol arm was included for study validation, but not for statistical comparison.
 We initiated our Phase 3 program for trabodenoson monotherapy in October 2015 and reported top-line data from the first pivotal trial in the program on January 3, 2017. While MATrX-1 did not meet its primary endpoint, it did demonstrate efficacy as compared to placebo. We are planning to complete the analyses of this trial, then request a meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2017 to discuss these findings.
 We are planning to commence our Phase 3 program for the FDC of trabodenoson and latanoprost in 2018.
 Clinical Results
 MATrX-1 Trabodenoson Phase 3 Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy of Monotherapy in Glaucoma Patients 
 
MATrX-1 was a Phase 3 randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of trabodenoson in approximately 300 subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT. MATrX-1 assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of trabodenoson over three months of treatment. The primary endpoint was reduction of IOP as compared to the placebo treatment arm. In addition, the study contained a timolol 0.5% arm to validate the sensitivity of the patient population and serve as an internal control. IOP was measured at four time points during the day: 8AM, 10AM, 12PM, and 4PM on Days 14, 28, 42 and 84. Three doses of trabodenoson ophthalmic suspension were administered: 3%/1000 mcg once daily, 4.5%/1500 mcg twice daily, and 6%/2000 mcg once daily. The trial enrolled patients with a diagnosis of POAG or OHT and an IOP greater than or equal to 24 mmHg and less than or equal to 34 mmHg. 
 
In early 2017 we announced the results of MATrX-1. The results showed a skewed distribution of the IOP data resulting from outliers, as identified from histogram and distribution statistics. To minimize their effects, a statistical approach using medians was considered more appropriate than an approach primarily based on means. Therefore, the analyses of IOP were performed using median data.
 
Results
 Total subjects randomized and treated was 300. The demographics of the trial were well balanced with a distribution of roughly 2/3rd POAGs to 1/3rd OHT subjects. Mean baseline IOPs ranged from 26.3 to 26.8 mmHg for all groups except for the timolol group which had a baseline IOP of 27.4 mmHg, as shown below.
 13



Efficacy
 The data showed that trabodenoson 6% once-a-day (QD) was the most effective dose, with IOP lowering that was comparable to that observed in Phase 2. Average Daily IOPs Change from Diurnal baseline at all days tested were statistically significantly lower than placebo, and the overall efficacy of the 6% QD dose was approximately 4.25 mmHg at the end of the study. While the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating statistical separation from placebo/vehicle on three days (each with four IOP time points) for a total of twelve time points throughout the trial (see below); this was primarily due to two factors: a placebo response that was substantially greater than that observed in Phase 2 (see below), and 4 ‘outlier’ sites out of a total 55 sites that had results well outside of the range of other sites. 
 

14



These 4 ‘outlier’ sites had a few subjects (n=5) randomized to the placebo arm with extreme placebo/vehicle responses that were clearly outside the norm or expected physiology. When all the data (from active as well as placebo subjects) from these 4 ‘outlier’ sites were removed from the analyses, despite a reduction in the overall sample size by 29 subjects, statistical significance was greatly increased, as shown below. This indicates the strong confounding effect of these few, but extreme placebo/vehicle outliers on the efficacy results.

Safety
 All doses of trabodenoson were well-tolerated, with approximately 1.6% of patients discontinuing the study due to drug-related side effects. There were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, related to trabodenoson. Consistent with prior trials, no evidence of significant systemic effects was observed. Notably, hyperemia was comparable between the trabodenoson and placebo arms. Also, there were no reports of drug-related eye pain, itching or irritation in any of the trabodenoson arms.
 
15

Trabodenoson Phase 2 Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy of Monotherapy in Glaucoma Patients
 In 2012, we completed a successful Phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial in 144 patients with OHT (ocular hypertension with no visual field loss) or POAG, which demonstrated a clear dose response to trabodenoson. Statistically significant results for the primary endpoint of our Phase 2 clinical trials indicate that trabodenoson has IOP-lowering effects in line with the best existing therapies, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile at all doses tested. The trial was randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, and evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of trabodenoson over two or four weeks of BID dosing with eye drops. Separate groups of patients received trabodenoson doses of 50, 100 or 200 mcg for two weeks, or 500 mcg for four weeks, and their IOP-lowering efficacy and safety data were compared to groups of patients dosed concurrently with placebo eye drops, also BID. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint was IOP (measured throughout the day). The primary efficacy analysis calculated the reduction in IOP from the patients’ IOP at the beginning of the study (recorded before active drug was administered at the study 8 AM baseline). A second analysis calculated the reduction in IOP from a time-matched diurnal baseline. The IOP drop from baseline for each dose group (50, 100, 200 and 500 mcg) was then compared statistically to the IOP drop of a matched placebo group treated concurrently.
 Results
 Patient Population: The characteristics of the patients in the dose groups were similar, including their ages, baseline IOPs, and diagnoses (OHT or POAG). The table below reflects information regarding the demographics of the patient populations that participated in the study, and shows that both diagnoses groups had similar baseline IOPs, and that groups treated with trabodenoson had characteristics that were similar to the placebo groups to which they were compared.
 Baseline Demographics and IOP
 
 
 | | | | Trabodenoson Dose | | | 
--------------------+----------+------+----------+-------------------+------+---------+---------
 | Placebo | | 50 mcg | | | 100 mcg | 200 mcg | 500 mcg | | Total Active
Mean Age | | 59 | | | 56.6 | | 55.6 | | 53.8 | | 57.6 | 56.3

Efficacy
 Both the 200 mcg dose and the 500 mcg doses at day 14, and the 500 mcg dose at day 28, met the primary endpoint demonstrating statistically significant improvements in IOP relative to the matched placebo (p<0.05 indicating a greater than 95% probability that the result was not a random event). Moreover, a clear increase in IOP-lowering efficacy was seen with increasing doses of trabodenoson (i.e. a dose response), and the most efficacious trabodenoson dose tested was the highest dose of 500 mcg. Trabodenoson’s primary efficacy endpoint (IOP drop from baseline) measured after four weeks of treatment (at day 28) had improved significantly from the same endpoint when measured after two weeks of treatment (at day 14). This improvement with additional treatment time was statistically significant (p=0.016). In the figure below, a clear trend for increasing IOP-lowering efficacy with increasing dose is evident. For the 500 mcg dose, the statistically significant increase in efficacy between day 14 and day 28 is illustrated on the right side of the figure.
 

On average, doubling doses between 50 and 500 mcg increases IOP lowering from diurnal baseline by approximately 0.7 mmHg.
 17

The IOP-lowering at the highest and most efficacious dose (500 mcg) was evaluated in various patient sub-populations to gain a sense of the ability to generalize the results over a diverse patient population. The figure below compares the IOP drop from study baseline (the primary endpoint analysis) for all patients (far left) to various sub-populations to the right of that. All of these patient subgroups responded to trabodenoson’s IOP-lowering effect.
 

When we rationally designed trabodenoson, our primary objective was to restore pressure regulation in eyes with high IOP, a risk factor for glaucoma. A healthy eye has a natural circadian rhythm that dictates a pattern of IOP over the day. We found that this pattern, or the shape of the IOP circadian rhythm curve throughout the day, is relatively unchanged by trabodenoson treatment, except that the overall IOP during the day is reduced by trabodenoson treatment as intended. We believe this indicates that the TM has been restored to an improved function resulting in a more normal average pressure, and that this normal daily IOP pattern indicates that the fundamental biology of pressure management in the eye has been preserved. The natural daily changes in IOP still exist, but at a significantly lower average pressure that we believe is less damaging to RGCs and the optic nerve. The figure below shows the primary efficacy parameter for the trial, IOP, at several timepoints throughout the day (diurnal IOP) for the highest dose tested and the placebo group at day 28.
 

Furthermore, after 28 days of BID dosing, the IOP-lowering effect persisted for an additional 24 hours after the last dose of medication, which we believe indicates the potential for trabodenoson monotherapy to be dosed QD.
 18

Safety and Tolerability
 There were no SAEs or patients that withdrew due to safety findings that occurred once the drug was given. There were no signs of systemic safety issues in any of the non-ocular examinations, ECG evaluations or laboratory tests performed. Systemically, administration of trabodenoson eye drops was found to be well-tolerated. There were no changes noted from internal eye examinations or visual testing during drug treatment. The rate of conjunctival hyperemia in patients treated with trabodenoson was unchanged from the placebo run-in period (study baseline). There was no maximum tolerated dose determined because all doses tested were well-tolerated.
 Trabodenoson Phase 2 Co-Administered with Latanoprost in Glaucoma Patients
 In October 2014, we received top-line results from a Phase 2 trial in patients with POAG or OHT, in which trabodenoson eye drops were co-administered with latanoprost eye drops. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and additional IOP-lowering effect of trabodenoson when added either BID or QD to latanoprost. This trial enrolled 101 patients who had IOPs of greater than or equal to 24 mmHg despite one month of previous treatment with latanoprost. These patients are considered PGA poor-responders, as evidenced by persistently elevated IOP at levels that typically require the addition of a second drug to further lower IOP. The trial was randomized, double-masked, placebo- and active- controlled.
 Following four weeks of latanoprost eye drops, otherwise healthy patients with an IOP greater than 24 mmHg and a diagnosis of either OHT or POAG were randomized for Part 1 of the study. In Part 1, the study arm consisted of BID-dosed trabodenoson (1.5%; 500 mcg nominal dose) plus latanoprost 0.005%, at the approved dose, QD. The control arm consisted of timolol 0.5%, an approved BID dose plus latanoprost 0.005% QD. Patients in both arms were treated for a total of eight weeks in Part 1 of the study to evaluate the additive effects of trabodenoson BID to latanoprost QD, with an active control consisting of timolol BID.
 At the end of Part 1, after eight weeks of treatment, patients began Part 2 of the study. In Part 2, the study arm was switched to a QD dose of trabodenoson (3.0%, 1,000 mcg nominal dose) plus latanoprost 0.005% QD, and patients in the control arm were switched to placebo QD plus latanoprost 0.005% QD. Part 2 was designed to measure the additive effects of trabodenoson QD to latanoprost QD over an additional four weeks. The number of patients planned for enrollment was ~100 (50 patients per arm) for Part 1 and ~80 (40 patients per arm) for Part 2. This trial is outlined below.
 

The primary efficacy endpoint was IOP, measured throughout the day. The efficacy analyses calculated the reduction in IOP from the patients’ IOP at study baseline and diurnal baseline (recorded after taking latanoprost for four weeks but before trabodenoson or timolol were added). In Part 1, these IOP drops from baseline, on latanoprost, were compared to the IOP drops of the control arm treated concurrently with timolol. In Part 2, the IOP drop from baseline in patients receiving trabodenoson QD plus latanoprost QD was compared to patients receiving placebo QD plus latanoprost QD.
 Safety evaluations included recording of withdrawals or terminations and adverse events, or AEs. In each patient, both eyes were evaluated at regular intervals with internal eye exams (including pupil dilation with slit lamp examination of the inside of the eye) and external eye examinations (of the outside surface of the eye, eye lids and surrounding tissue). Visual function was also assessed. Overall health was assessed by physical exam, vital signs (including heart rate and blood pressure), electrocardiograms, or ECGs, for heart function and analysis of urine and blood samples (clinical chemistry). Plasma samples were collected to analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the half-life of any drug detected in the systemic circulation.

Results
 Patient Population: The characteristics of the patients in the dose groups were similar, including their age, and baseline IOPs, which were not adequately controlled following a four-week run-in using latanoprost therapy. The table below includes information on the demographics of the patients that participated in the study.
 Baseline Demographics and IOP
 
 
 | Part 1 | | Part 2 
--------------------------------------+------------------+-------+------------
ITT population | Trabodenoson BID | | Timolol BID | | Trabodenoson QD | Placebo QD
n | | 50 | | 51 | | 37 | 43 
Mean Age | | 62 | | 61 | | 63 | 61 
Baseline IOP using latanoprost (mmHg) | | 25.71 | | 25.86 | | 25.68 | 25.86
OHT n (%) | 23(46%) | | 13(25.5%) | | 15(40.5%) | 12(28%) 
Baseline IOP using latanoprost (mmHg) | | 25.78 | | 25.65 | | 25.93 | 25.29
POAG n (%) | 27(54%) | | 38(74.5%) | | 22(59.5%) | 31(72%) 
Baseline IOP using latanoprost (mmHg) | | 25.65 | | 25.93 | | 25.50 | 26.08

Discontinuations:
 In Part 1, there were four discontinuations due to either protocol violations or exclusionary criteria (three patients were in the trabodenoson group and one was in the timolol group). In Part 2, there were two discontinuations; one was discontinued due to an AE and the other did not to return during follow-up, but provided no explanation (both were in the placebo group).
Efficacy
 After eight weeks of BID dosing in Part 1, patients treated with trabodenoson co-administered with latanoprost experienced further mean reductions of IOP of 3.4 and 4.9 mmHg from diurnal and study baselines, respectively, beyond the IOP-lowering of latanoprost. After switching to QD trabodenoson in Part 2, and treating for an additional four weeks, QD dosing with trabodenoson resulted in a mean reduction in IOP of 4.3 and 5.8 mmHg from diurnal and study baseline, respectively, from the IOP on latanoprost alone. At the end of Part 2 (after 12 weeks), the IOP-lowering seen in the Study Eye (the eye treated with trabodenoson) was statistically significantly greater than the IOP drop of the patient’s Control Eye (the patient’s other eye that only received QD latanoprost).
 20

In Part 1 the IOP drop at the end of 8 weeks of treatment, in this population of latanoprost poor-responders, was less than timolol BID (0.5%) which dropped pressure 6.1 and 7.6 mmHg, on average from diurnal and study baselines, respectively.
 
In Part 2 of the trial, QD trabodenoson lowered IOP an additional 4.3 and 5.8 mmHg from diurnal and study baseline, respectively, beyond the effect of latanoprost alone in this population of latanoprost poor-responders.
 Consistency of Results across Phase II Studies
 Mean reductions in IOP from study baseline ranging from 5.0 mmHg after four weeks of BID treatment to 5.8 mmHg after four weeks of QD treatment in the trial were similar to the 6.5 mmHg IOP reduction seen at the end of the four week Trabodenoson Phase 2 Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy of Monotherapy in Glaucoma Patients trial (the monotherapy trial). In the monotherapy trial, patients received only trabodenoson. The patients in the 2014 additivity trial represented a different patient population than those studied in the monotherapy trial. These patients had inadequate responses to latanoprost, as evidenced by persistently high IOP, despite latanoprost treatment for four weeks prior to randomization. This patient population typically requires the addition of a second drug to their PGA therapy to further lower IOP. Patients in the monotherapy trial, by contrast, were removed from all glaucoma medications, and thus represented a typical patient population studied in a Phase 3 glaucoma trial. Despite these differences in the patient populations, the efficacy of trabodenoson was consistent across trials, suggesting that trabodenoson’s mechanism of action is effective across a wide-range of glaucoma disease severity.
 

21

Both OHT and POAG patients responded to trabodenoson with POAG subjects showing the largest IOP drops.
 

Safety and Tolerability
 With the exception of a single patient who received placebo plus latanoprost, no patients dropped out of the trial as a result of a drug-related adverse effect or due to drug intolerability. Trabodenoson was well tolerated in the eye, with no drug related hyperemia detectable by ocular exam at four, eight or 12 weeks. Mild hyperemia seen on the first day of dosing in a minority of patients was back to baseline by the 10-week post dose ocular exams. Trabodenoson had no detectable systemic effects in any of the non-ocular examinations, ECG evaluations or laboratory tests performed. Overall AEs were similar in the BID phase (Trabodenoson 36%; Timolol 29%), with the trabodenoson rate dropping to 26% without the first-day hyperemias, and were also similar in the QD phase (Trabodenoson 16%; Placebo 14%) between treatment groups. However, timolol (dosed in one eye only) had systemic AEs associated with systemic beta blockade, including: dizziness, headache, fatigue and symptomatic sinus bradycardia.
 Patients randomized to timolol also had lower pulse rates than in the trabodenoson group (the pulse rate was measured 30 minutes and one hour after dosing). This difference was statistically significant in the overall data (p=0.033) as well as at the individual timepoints (p=0.041 and p=0.030 at the 30 minute and one hour post-dose timepoints, respectively).
 22

The pulse rates for both groups are shown in the boxplot below, which includes the minimum and maximum values, median (white line), and the boundaries of the upper and lower quartiles (top and bottom of the box).
 

Trabodenoson Repeat-Dose Safety and Tolerability in Adult Healthy Volunteers
 We conducted a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial in healthy volunteers, aged 35-65, with the primary objective of characterizing the safety and tolerability profile of trabodenoson and identifying a maximum tolerated dose (a dose that was associated with limiting or intolerable side effects).
 Ten subjects were assigned to each of seven consecutive cohorts (six to active trabodenoson and four to matched placebo). Cohorts 1 through 6 consisted of sequential, escalating doses (200, 400, 800, 1600, 2400 and 3200 mcg of trabodenoson) which were given topically to a single eye, BID, for 14 days. The 3200 mcg dose was the highest dose that could be administered to a single eye at one time due to, among others, the limitations of the formulation. Cohort 7 included eight step-wise escalating doses of trabodenoson, given in both eyes. Doses given to this cohort ranged from 200-3200 mcg in a single eye and totaled 1800-6400 mcg for both eyes combined. Dose escalation to the next dose level proceeded only after masked review of the safety data from the preceding dose level.
 Systemic safety assessments included: AEs, other medications used, physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests of blood and urine samples, extensive monitoring of cardiac function and health (12-lead ECG tracings, continuous cardiac monitoring and cardiac troponin concentrations), lung function testing (FEV1), sleep (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), kidney function and withdrawals or terminations. No systemic safety signals were found at any of the doses tested.
 Ocular safety assessments included vision tests (visual acuity), IOP measurements, as well as internal and external eye examinations. No significant changes were seen in IOP measurements and examination of the periorbital area, eyelids, eyelashes, pupils, cornea, iris and sclera. The only ocular finding was short-lived, self-limited conjunctival hyperemia that was dose-related, usually mild in severity, decreased with continuing exposure, and was not accompanied by evidence that it was related to inflammation, such as persistent anterior chamber cells or flare. The incidence of clinically significant eye redness reported as an AE was extremely low (1 of 42) in subjects randomized to trabodenoson.
 Early Terminations and Withdrawals
 Three subjects randomized to placebo were terminated early from the study for reasons unrelated to the study drug. Only one subject assigned to active study drug was withdrawn. The study subject’s laboratory tests revealed findings consistent with gallbladder disease (chronic cholecystitis), so the subject was withdrawn from the clinical trial (without unmasking the subject’s treatment assignment) and referred for a surgical consult resulting in the subject having chronic gallbladder stones removed.
 23

Pharmacokinetic Data
 The pharmacokinetics data indicated that the exposure to trabodenoson generally increased in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest three doses, there were no apparent increases in systemic exposure with increasing dose. This plateau effect suggests that little additional drug is absorbed into systemic circulation following doses above 4800 mcg (2400 mcg per eye), as reflected in the figure below.
Conclusions
 In conclusion, no safety or tolerability issues were identified in either the eye or the body as a whole. Due to the lack of clinically significant findings following in depth safety testing for systemic and ocular effects of trabodenoson, no maximum tolerated dose could be identified. Systemic exposure to trabodenoson appeared to be limited above ocular doses totaling 4800 mcg, indicating an apparent limitation to the amount of drug that can be delivered to the body by dosing in the eye.
Trabodenoson Monotherapy Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy
 We conducted a Phase 1/2 multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial in 70 adults with POAG and OHT with the primary objective of characterizing the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of a pilot formulation of trabodenoson monotherapy.
 Subjects were sequentially assigned to one of seven consecutive cohorts (eight to active trabodenoson and four to matched placebo); consisting of sequential, escalating single-doses of 2.5, 7.5, 20, 60, 180, 350 or 700 mcg of trabodenoson given topically to a single study eye.
 Efficacy (IOP-lowering), tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics assessments were performed following study drug administration, and dose escalation from one cohort to the next cohort proceeded only after masked review of the safety data from the preceding cohort.
 Conclusions
 In conclusion, trabodenoson monotherapy ophthalmic solution up to and including 700 mcg were well-tolerated. This preliminary formulation of trabodenoson demonstrated activity at lowering IOP following single doses of 350 mcg and 700 mcg in patients with POAG or OHT.

Development Strategy
 Trabodenoson
 We had an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2015 to discuss our Phase 3 program for trabodenoson monotherapy and to confirm the design and endpoints for the Phase 3 pivotal trials. At the meeting, we reached agreement on the design of our initial Phase 3 study, as well as the overall regulatory path for trabodenoson. We commenced our Phase 3 program for trabodenoson monotherapy in October 2015 and reported top-line results in January 2017. The recently completed Phase 3 pivotal trial, MATrX-1, did not meet its primary endpoint because it did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in absolute IOP from placebo at every single one of the 12 time points comprising the primary endpoint.  This was due to a larger than expected treatment effect in the placebo/vehicle group, as compared to both our prior Phase 2 data and a recent meta-analysis examining placebo responses from 10 placebo-controlled trials, which showed a placebo/vehicle result of -2.01 mmHg (Raber, et al). During analysis of the IOP data from the trial, a treatment-by-site interaction was found where a small number of sites (4 sites out of a total of 55) caused an important change in the expected vehicle results. The review of the MATrX-1 data is ongoing and upon completion of all analyses, we plan to request a meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2017 to discuss these findings.
 The overall program will encompass a total subject exposure to trabodenoson of at least 1,300 patients. The final design of the second Phase 3 trial will be impacted by the findings of the initial Phase 3 trial. Following a run-in period, the second Phase 3 trial is expected to run for at least 12 weeks of active treatment with the primary endpoint of IOP-lowering over the day.
 The initial Phase 3 trial was a three-month study with five treatment arms, for a total of approximately 300 patients with 3 trabodenoson treatment arms. The trabodenoson doses evaluated were 1,000 mcg QD, 2,000 mcg QD, and 1,500 mcg BID. The trial investigated both once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) dosing, as some patients may benefit from a twice daily dosing regimen. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was IOP, measured at four time points during the day after 4, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. The IOP of the trabodenoson treated subjects was statistically compared to those of placebo treated subjects. A timolol arm was included for study validation, but not for statistical comparison.
 The FDA requires that a total of at least 1,300 patients be exposed to at least a single dose of trabodenoson, and the complete submission package must also contain safety data from at least 300 patients treated with trabodenoson for at least six months, and at least 100 patients treated for at least a year. These longer-term treatments will be accomplished in a long-term safety trial conducted at the highest anticipated trabodenoson dose. If the primary objectives of all trials in our Phase 3 program are met, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for marketing approval of trabodenoson for the treatment of glaucoma in the United States.
 Fixed-Dose Combination of Trabodenoson and Latanoprost
 We are also developing an FDC of trabodenoson and latanoprost. We have not filed a separate investigational new drug application, or IND, for the FDC, as we expect to be able to rely on the existing trabodenoson IND. Similarly, we have not conducted a Phase 1 trial for the FDC as we were able to rely on the safety and tolerability data generated in our completed trials for trabodenoson as a monotherapy.
 The results of the Phase 2 trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of latanoprost and trabodenoson, at two dose levels, and when given QD and BID, informed the design and format of the currently ongoing study which was structured to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various dose combinations and dosing patterns of an FDC of latanoprost and trabodenoson. The commencement of our Phase 2 program for the FDC product candidate as well as future FDC trials will depend on successful cGMP manufacturing of stable FDC dosage forms. We initiated our Phase 2 program in 2016 and plan to start our Phase 3 FDC program in 2018. We expect our FDC product candidate to benefit many patients with higher IOPs and more severe disease that typically require more aggressive medical treatment. For this reason, the patient population for the FDC program is expected to carry a higher disease burden. As with the monotherapy product development, the FDA requirements for long-term dosing data (at least 300 patients treated with the FDC for at least six months, and at least 100 patients treated for at least a year) will require the program to include a long-term safety study.
 Neuroprotection and Degenerative Retinal Diseases
 We plan to study the neuroprotective potential of trabodenoson monotherapy and our FDC product candidate to slow the loss of vision significantly more than attributable to IOP-lowering alone either in glaucoma patients or other rarer forms of optic neuropathy. While supported by the basic biology of adenosine, we have not yet conducted a formal program of studies to prove neuroprotection and have not filed an IND related to this program. This evaluation may include longer longitudinal studies in glaucoma patients, as potentially smaller patient groups with rapidly-progressing optic nerve damage. Although treatment times will be measured in years rather than months, this effort can run in parallel to the normal development trials, or may be included in the objectives of the planned long-term safety trials. The regulatory path for such an indication is thus far uncharted, so significant regulatory as well as clinical risk 
 25

is anticipated for such a program and close interaction with regulatory agencies will be required. Due to the speculative nature of the development, it is difficult at this time to predict if or when an NDA submission in support of neuroprotection indication may be submitted. We plan to continue pre-clinical and proof-of-concept trials for optic neuropathies and degenerative retinal diseases in 2017.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis International AG and its subsidiary Alcon Labs, Pfizer/Allergan Inc., Bausch + Lomb, Inc. (now a unit of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.), Merck & Co., Inc., Santen Inc., Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat glaucoma. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, tolerability and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental authorities and other third-party payors.
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Glaukos Corporation recently commercialized a trabecular micro-bypass stent that is implanted in the eye during cataract surgery and allows fluid to flow from the anterior of the eye into the collecting channels, bypassing the TM. In addition, early-stage companies that are also developing glaucoma treatments, such as Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is developing a Rho kinase/norepinephrine transport inhibitor, may prove to be significant competitors. We expect that our competitors will continue to develop new glaucoma treatments, which may include eye drops, oral treatments, surgical procedures, implantable devices or laser treatments.
 Other early-stage companies may also compete through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer adverse effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases physicians, insurers or other third-party payors may encourage the use of generic products. The market for glaucoma prescriptions is highly competitive and is currently dominated by generic drugs, such as latanoprost and timolol, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If any of our product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a premium over competitive generic products and consistent with other branded glaucoma drugs.
 Manufacturing
 Trabodenoson is a small molecule that is capable of being manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. We believe the chemistry used to manufacture trabodenoson is amenable to a scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product for our clinical trials. We manage such production with all our vendors on a purchase order basis in accordance with applicable master service and supply agreements. We do not have long-term agreements with these manufacturers or any other third-party suppliers. Latanoprost and timolol, used in our clinical trials, are available in commercial quantities from multiple reputable third-party manufacturers. We intend to procure quantities on a purchase order basis for our clinical and commercial production. If any of our existing third-party suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might experience a delay in our ability to obtain alternative suppliers. We also do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates if they are approved. With respect to commercial production of our product candidates in the future, we plan to outsource production of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and final drug product manufacturing if they are approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities.
 26

We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced in a cost effective manner at contract manufacturing facilities. However, should a supplier or manufacturer on which we have relied to produce a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, we would likely experience delays and additional costs, each of which could be significant.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
 We own a patent portfolio covering the trabodenoson compound that includes issued patents in the United States, Europe, Japan, and several other countries. These composition-of-matter patents are scheduled to expire by early 2026 in the United States and by mid-2025 abroad. We also own an issued U.S. patent and have pending patent applications in Europe and Japan relating to the use of trabodenoson for reducing IOP. The issued U.S. patent is scheduled to expire in 2031 and the pending foreign patent applications, if issued, are scheduled to expire by 2030. In 2016, we had a U.S. composition-of-matter patent issued that covers polymorphs of trabodenoson. This patent is scheduled to expire in 2033. A detailed freedom-to-operate analysis has been conducted and we are not aware of any third party rights or impediments to commercializing trabodenoson for use in ophthalmic indications in the United States or Europe.
 Our patent portfolio includes issued U.S. patents relating to combinations of trabodenoson with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta blockers and prostaglandins (PGAs). These U.S. patents are scheduled to expire in 2031 and 2032. At the end of 2016, we also had an ophthalmic formulation patent issue in the U.S. that covers our current ophthalmic formulation. This U.S. patent is scheduled to expire in 2034.
 We are also pursuing additional patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to:
  
• | combinations of trabodenoson with PGAs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors or beta blockers, in patent applications which, if issued, are scheduled to expire by 2031;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | polymorphs of trabodenoson, in patent applications which, if issued, are scheduled to expire by 2033;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | formulations of trabodenoson, in patent applications which, if issued, are scheduled to expire by 2034; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ocular neuroprotective uses of trabodenoson, in patent applications which, if issued, are scheduled to expire by 2034.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As we advance the development of our trabodenoson products and clinical development we continue to look at opportunities to file additional patent applications covering new and innovative developments to ensure we have a patent portfolio that is multifaceted. For such additional applications, we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and other jurisdictions that are important in the ophthalmic markets.
 In addition to our patents and patent applications, we keep certain of our proprietary information as trade secrets, which we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and by seeking to maintain the physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Regulation and Marketing Approval
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include, among other things, the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, of a clinical hold on trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, 
 27

advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of our products. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. See “The NDA Approval Process” below.
 The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and that the integrity of the data is maintained;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and of selected clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of an NDA which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
 Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 IND and Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an initial IND, which contains the results of preclinical testing along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the drug product or the conduct of the clinical trial and imposes a clinical hold. A clinical hold may also be imposed at any time while the IND is in effect. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin or re-commence. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence or continue.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or IND so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP, and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary.
 A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB for each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted must review and approve the clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory 
 28

authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
 For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1– the drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2– trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3– when Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 trials, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all.
 An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in a single dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components. In addition, typically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with our products, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more.
 Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved up to a maximum of two years. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The NDA Approval Process
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the End-of-Phase 1 or 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be 
 29

requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End-of-Phase 2 meetings to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept a NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs for new molecular entities in 10 months from the 60-day filing date (typically 12 months from submission of the NDA). The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its substantive review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. See “Post-Marketing Requirements” below.
 The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or a REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “Dear Doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases distribution and use restrictions, referred to as “elements to assure safe use,” or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or use, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, 
 30

including safety labeling or imposition of a REMS, the requirement to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Market Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain competing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a drug product that contains the protected active moiety. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, or supplement, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the same conditions of approval as the innovator drug. This three-year exclusivity protects only the conditions of approval associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications with different conditions of approval. For example, if three-year exclusivity protected a new extended-release dosage form, the exclusivity would not block approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the original immediate-release version of the drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data.
 Post-Marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, or off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may, in their independent professional medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers typically may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include a lengthy review process.
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.

In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacturing is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 In addition, the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are subject to annual product and establishment fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase 4 testing, to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval via a REMS that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare program administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers, and other entities. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all of part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, our products, once approved, may not obtain market acceptance unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
 32

In particular, our success may depend on our ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement through Medicare Part D plans for our products that obtain regulatory approval. The Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the Part D program applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payors.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates, once approved. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
 In the United States, among other things, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation and enforcement by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. Our current and future business activities, including for example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with healthcare regulatory laws, as applicable, which may include the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy and security regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended, physician payment transparency laws, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or 
 33

recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future business activities, including our sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with ophthalmologists and optometrists might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us.
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. This statute has been interpreted to prohibit presenting claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal Civil False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a civil False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.
 Additionally, HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of individuals and organizations. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 34


The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 We plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the law and program requirements to which we will or may become subject because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs.
 Changes in law or the interpretation of existing law could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 Affordable Care Act and Other Reform Initiatives
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted. The ACA includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
  
• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in exchange for state Medicaid coverage of most of the manufacturer’s drugs. ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs used in orphan indications. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. The ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA included the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exception, to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” provided, as well as any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to CMS for the first reporting period (August 1, 2013—December 31, 2013) by March 31, 2014, and were required to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the completeness and accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. The information reported was made publicly available on a searchable website in September 2014.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 35

 
• | The ACA established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to improve quality of care and lower program costs of Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation through 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of the details regarding the implementation of the ACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that the ACA would have on our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.
 European Union Drug Development
 In the European Union, our products will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if an MAA from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained, and the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trial regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved by two distinct bodies in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. In addition, all serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 The EU clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing a revision process mainly aimed at making more uniform and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing the transparency of clinical trials.
 European Union Drug Review Approval
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining an MAA. There are two types of MAAs: the Community MAA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, a body of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and the National MAA, which is issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only authorized marketing in that Member State’s national territory and not the EEA as a whole.
 The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. The National MAA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this 
 36

National MAA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MAA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MAA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MAA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
