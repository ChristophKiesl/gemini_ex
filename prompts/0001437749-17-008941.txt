Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies
 
Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies - Operations
 
The Company develops and manufactures engineered, advanced composite materials and advanced composite parts and assemblies and low-volume tooling for the aerospace markets and prototype tooling for such parts and assemblies. 
 
The Company’s advanced composite materials are developed and manufactured by the Company’s Park Aerospace Technologies Corp. (“PATC”) business unit located at the Newton, Kansas Airport and by the Company’s Nelco Products Pte. Ltd. business unit in Singapore. The Company’s advanced composite parts and assemblies and low-volume tooling are also developed and manufactured by the Company’s PATC business unit.
 
PATC offers a full range of advanced composite materials manufacturing capability, as well as composite parts design, assembly and production capability, all in its Newton facility. PATC offers composite aircraft and space vehicle parts design and assembly services, in addition to “build-to-print” services. The Company believes that the ability of its PATC facility to offer such a wide and comprehensive array of composite materials and parts manufacturing and development technology and capability to the aircraft and space vehicle industries provides attractive benefits and advantages to those industries.
 
Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies – Industry Background
 
The advanced composite materials manufactured by the Company and its competitors are used primarily to fabricate light-weight, high-strength structures with specifically designed performance characteristics. Composite materials are typically highly specified combinations of resin formulations and reinforcements. Reinforcements can be unidirectional fibers, woven fabrics, or non-woven goods such as mats or felts. Resin formulations are typically highly proprietary, and include various chemical and physical mixtures. The Company produces resin formulations using various epoxies, polyesters, phenolics, cyanate esters, polyimides and other complex matrices. The reinforcement combined with the resin is referred to as a “prepreg”. Advanced composite materials can be broadly categorized as either thermosets or thermoplastics. While both material types require the addition of heat to form a consolidated laminate, thermoplastics can be reformed using additional heat. Once fully cured, thermoset materials cannot be further reshaped. The Company believes that the demand for thermoset advanced materials is greater than that for thermoplastics due to the fact that fabrication processes for thermoplastics require much higher temperatures and pressures and are, therefore, typically more capital intensive than the fabrication processes for thermoset materials. 
 
The Company works with aerospace original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), such as general aviation aircraft manufacturers and commercial aircraft manufacturers, and certain tier 1 suppliers to qualify its advanced composite materials or parts and assemblies for use on current and upcoming programs. The Company’s customers typically design and specify a material specifically to meet the needs of the part’s end use and the customers’ processing methods. Such customers sometimes work with a supplier to develop the specific resin system and reinforcement combination to match the application. The Company’s customers’ processing, or the Company’s processing, may include hand lay-up, resin infusion or more advanced automated lay-up processes. Automated lay-up processes include automated tape lay-up, automated fiber placement and filament winding. These fabrication processes significantly alter the material form purchased. After the lay-up process is completed, the material is cured by the addition of heat and pressure. Cure processes typically include vacuum bag oven curing, high pressure autoclave, press forming and before-press curing. After the part has been cured, final finishing and trimming, and assembly of the structure, is performed by the fabricator or the Company.

Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies – Products
 
The advanced composite materials products manufactured by the Company are primarily thermoset curing prepregs. The Company has developed proprietary resin formulations to suit the needs of the markets in which it participates by analyzing the needs of the markets and working with its customers. The complex process of developing resin formulations and selecting the proper reinforcement is accomplished through a collaborative effort of the Company’s research and development and technical sales and marketing resources working with the customers’ technical staff. The Company focuses on developing a thorough understanding of its customers’ businesses, product lines, processes and technical challenges. The Company develops innovative solutions which utilize technologically advanced materials and concepts for its customers.
 
The Company’s advanced composite materials products include prepregs manufactured from proprietary formulations using modified epoxies, phenolics, polyesters, cyanate esters and polyimides combined with woven, non-woven and unidirectional reinforcements. Reinforcement materials used to produce the Company’s products include polyacrylonitrile (“PAN”) based carbon fiber, E-glass (fiberglass), S2 glass, quartz, carbonized rayon, aramids, such as Kevlar® (“Kevlar” is a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.), Twaron® (“Twaron” is a registered trademark of Teijin Twaron B.V. LLC), polyester and other synthetic materials. The Company also sells certain specialty prepregs, such as Raycarb C2, a carbonized rayon fabric produced by Airbus Safran Launchers SAS (formerly Herakles, formerly Snecma Propulsion Solide) and used mainly in the rocket motor industry, and Enka AS, a proprietary commercial rayon fabric produced by Highland Industries, Inc. and used in the aerospace industry as the base white material for carbon phenolic applications.
 
The Company’s composite parts and assemblies are manufactured with carbon, fiberglass and other reinforcements impregnated with formulated resins. Certain of these impregnated reinforcements, or prepregs, are also manufactured by PATC. The Company also provides low-volume tooling in connection with its manufacture and sale of composite parts and assemblies. 
 
Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies – Customers and End Markets
 
The Company’s advanced composite materials, parts and assemblies customers include manufacturers of turbofan engines, aircraft primary and secondary structures and radomes, including military aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”), business jets and turboprops, large and regional transport aircraft and helicopters, space vehicles, rocket motors and specialty industrial products. The Company’s advanced composite materials are marketed primarily by sales personnel and, to a lesser extent, by independent distributors and independent sales representatives, and the Company’s advanced composite parts and assemblies are marketed primarily by sales personnel. 
 
While no single advanced composite materials, parts and assemblies customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total sales during any of the last three fiscal years, the loss of a major customer or of a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or its consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The Company’s aerospace customers include fabricators of aircraft composite parts and assemblies. The Company’s advanced composite materials are used by such fabricators and by the Company to produce primary and secondary structures, aircraft interiors and various other aircraft components. The Company’s customers for aerospace materials, and the Company itself, produce parts and assemblies for commercial aircraft and for the general aviation and business aviation, kit aircraft, special mission, UAVs and military markets. Many of the Company’s composite materials are used in the manufacture of aircraft certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”). 
 
Customers for the Company’s rocket motor materials include United States defense prime contractors and subcontractors. These customers fabricate rocket motors for heavy lift space launchers, strategic defense weapons, tactical motors and various other applications. The Company’s materials are used to produce heat shields, exhaust gas management devices and insulative and ablative nozzle components. Rocket motors are primarily used for commercial and military space launch, and for tactical and strategic weapons. The Company also has customers for these materials outside of the United States.
 
The Company also sells composite materials for use in RF electrical applications. Customers buying these materials typically fabricate antennas and radomes engineered to preserve electrical signal integrity. A radome is a protective cover over an electrical antenna or signal generator. The radome is designed to minimize signal loss and distortion. 
 
Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies – Manufacturing 
 
The Company’s manufacturing facilities for advanced composite materials are currently located in Newton, Kansas and in Singapore, and its manufacturing facility for composite parts and assemblies is also located in Newton, Kansas. See “Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies – Operations” elsewhere in this Report. 
 
The process for manufacturing composite materials, parts and assemblies is capital intensive and requires sophisticated equipment, significant technical know-how and very tight process controls. The key steps used in the manufacturing process include resin mixing, resin film casting and reinforcement impregnation via hot-melt process or a solution process.
 
Prepreg is manufactured by the Company using either solvent (solution) coating methods on a treater or by hot melt impregnation. A solution treater is a roll-to-roll continuous process machine which sequences reinforcement through tension controllers and combines solvated resin with the reinforcement. The reinforcement is dipped in resin, passed through a drying oven which removes the solvent and advances (or partially cures) the resin. The prepreg material is interleafed with a carrier and cut to the roll lengths desired by the customer. The Company also manufactures prepreg using hot melt impregnation methods which use no solvent. Hot melt prepreg manufacturing is achieved by mixing a resin formulation in a heated resin vessel, casting a thin film on a carrier paper, and laminating the reinforcement with the resin film. 
 
The Company also completes additional processing services, such as slitting, sheeting, biasing, sewing and cutting, if needed by the customer. Many of the products manufactured by the Company also undergo extensive testing of the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the product. These testing requirements are completed in the laboratories and facilities located at the Company’s manufacturing facilities.

The Company’s laboratories have been approved by several aerospace OEMs, and the Company has achieved certification pursuant to the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (“NADCAP”) for both non-metallic materials manufacturing and testing and composites fabrication. After all the processing has been completed, the product is tested and packaged for shipment to the customer. The Company typically supplies final product to the customer in roll or sheet form. The Company’s PATC facility has received accreditation by NADCAP for composite parts manufacturing and for composite materials manufacturing, and the Company believes that the PATC facility is one of the few facilities in the world with NADCAP accreditation for manufacturing both composite materials and composite parts. The Company has also received AS9100C certification for its quality management system for the manufacture of advanced composite materials and design and manufacturing of parts for aircraft and aerospace industries.
 
Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies – Materials and Sources of Supply
 
The Company designs and manufactures its advanced composite materials to its own specifications and to the specifications of its customers. Product development efforts are focused on developing prepreg materials that meet the specifications of the customers. The materials used in the manufacture of these engineered materials include graphite and carbon fibers and fabrics, aramids, such as Kevlar® ("Kevlar" is a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.) and Twaron® (“Twaron” is a registered trademark of Teijin Twaron B.V. LLC), quartz, fiberglass, polyester, specialty chemicals, resins, films, plastics, adhesives and certain other synthetic materials. The Company purchases these materials from several suppliers. Substitutes for many of these materials are not readily available. The qualification and certification of advanced composite materials for certain FAA certified aircraft typically include specific requirements for raw material supply and may restrict the Company’s flexibility in qualifying alternative sources of supply for certain key raw materials. The Company continues to work to determine acceptable alternatives for several raw materials. 
 
The Company manufactures composite parts and assemblies primarily to its customers’ specifications using its own composite materials or composite materials supplied by third parties, based on the specific requirements of the Company’s customers. 
 
Advanced Composite Materials, Parts and Assemblies – Competition
 
The Company has many competitors in the advanced composite materials, parts and assemblies markets, ranging in size from large international corporations to small regional producers. Several of the Company’s largest competitors are vertically integrated, producing raw materials, such as carbon fiber and cloth, as well as composite parts and assemblies. Some of the Company’s competitors may also serve as a supplier to the Company. The Company competes for business primarily on the basis of responsiveness, product performance and consistency, product qualification, FAA data base design allowables and innovative new product development.

Printed Circuit Materials
 
Printed Circuit Materials - Operations
 
The Company is also a leading global designer and manufacturer of advanced printed circuit materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnection systems, such as multilayer back-planes, wireless packages, high-speed/low-loss multilayers and high density interconnects (“HDIs”). The Company’s multilayer printed circuit materials consist of copper-clad laminates and prepregs, which is an acronym for pre-impregnated material. The Company has long-term relationships with its major customers, which include leading independent printed circuit board fabricators, electronic manufacturing service companies, electronic contract manufacturers and major electronic original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). Multilayer printed circuit boards and interconnect systems are used in virtually all advanced electronic equipment to direct, sequence and control electronic signals between semiconductor devices (such as microprocessors and memory and logic devices), passive components (such as resistors and capacitors) and connection devices (such as infra-red couplings, fiber optics, compliant pin and surface mount connectors). Examples of end uses of the Company’s digital printed circuit materials include high speed routers and servers, telecommunications switches, storage area networks, supercomputers, satellite switching equipment and wireless local area networks ("LANs"). The Company's RF/microwave printed circuit materials are used primarily for military avionics, antennas, power amplifiers and other components for cellular telephone base stations, automotive adaptive cruise control systems and avionic communications equipment. The Company has developed long-term relationships with major customers as a result of its leading edge products, extensive technical and engineering service support and responsive manufacturing capabilities.
 
Park believes it founded the modern day printed circuit industry in 1957 by inventing a composite material consisting of an epoxy resin substrate reinforced with fiberglass cloth which was laminated together with sheets of thin copper foil. This epoxy-glass copper-clad laminate system is still used to construct the large majority of today’s advanced printed circuit products. The Company also believes that in 1962 it invented the first multilayer printed circuit materials system used to construct multilayer printed circuit boards. The Company also pioneered vacuum lamination and many other manufacturing technologies used in the industry today. The Company believes it is one of the industry’s technological leaders.
 
The Company believes that it is one of only a few significant independent manufacturers of high performance multilayer printed circuit materials in the world. The Company was the first manufacturer in the printed circuit materials industry to establish manufacturing presences in the three major global markets of North America, Europe and Asia, with facilities established in Europe in 1969 and Asia in 1986.
 
Printed Circuit Materials – Industry Background
 
The printed circuit materials manufactured by the Company and its competitors are used primarily to construct and fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other advanced electronic interconnection systems. Multilayer printed circuit materials consist of prepregs and copper-clad laminates. Prepregs are chemically and electrically engineered thermosetting or thermoplastic resin systems which are impregnated into and reinforced by a specially manufactured fiberglass cloth product or other woven or non-woven reinforcing fiber. This insulating dielectric substrate generally is 0.125 inch to 0.001 inch in thickness. While these resin systems historically have been based on epoxy resin chemistry, in recent years, increasingly demanding OEM requirements have driven the industry to utilize proprietary enhanced epoxies as well as other higher performance resins, such as phenolic, bismalimide triazine ("BT"), cyanate ester, standard and enhanced non-Methylene Dianiline (“MDA”) polyimide, allylated polyphenylene ether (“APPE”) or polytetrafluoroethylene ("PTFE"). One or more plies of prepreg are laminated together to form an insulating dielectric substrate to support the copper circuitry patterns of a multilayer printed circuit board. Copper-clad laminates consist of one or more plies of prepreg with each ply laminated on the top and bottom with specialty thin copper foil. Copper foil is specially formed in thin sheets which may vary from 0.0056 inch to 0.0002 inch in thickness and normally have a thickness of 0.0014 inch or 0.0007 inch. The Company supplies both copper-clad laminates and prepregs to its customers, which use these products as a system to construct multilayer printed circuit boards.

The printed circuit board fabricator processes copper-clad laminates to form the inner layers of a multilayer printed circuit board. The fabricator photo images these laminates with a dry film or liquid photoresist. After development of the photoresist, the copper surfaces of the laminate are etched to form the circuit pattern. The fabricator then assembles these etched laminates by inserting one or more plies of dielectric prepreg between each of the inner layer etched laminates and also between an inner layer etched laminate and the outer layer copper plane, and then laminating the entire assembly in a press. Prepreg serves as the insulator and bond between the multiple layers of copper circuitry patterns found in the multilayer circuit board. When the multilayer configuration is laminated, these plies of prepreg form an insulating dielectric substrate supporting and separating the multiple inner and outer planes of copper circuitry. The fabricator drills vertical through-holes or vias in the multilayer assembly and then plates the through-holes or vias to form vertical conductors between the multiple layers of circuitry patterns. These through-holes or vias combine with the conductor paths on the horizontal circuitry planes to create a three-dimensional electronic interconnect system. In specialized applications, an additional set of microvia layers (2 or 4, typically) may be added through a secondary lamination process to provide increased density and functionality to the design. The outer two layers of copper foil are then imaged and etched to form the finished multilayer printed circuit board. The completed multilayer board is a three-dimensional interconnect system with electronic signals traveling in the horizontal planes of multiple layers of copper circuitry patterns, as well as in the vertical planes through the plated holes or vias.
 
Semiconductor manufacturers have introduced successive generations of more powerful microprocessors and memory and logic devices. Electronic equipment manufacturers have designed these advanced semiconductors into more compact products. High performance computing devices in these smaller platforms require greater reliability, faster signal speeds, closer tolerances, higher component and circuit density and increased overall complexity. As a result, the interconnect industry has developed smaller, lighter, faster and more cost-effective interconnect systems, including advanced multilayer printed circuit boards.
 
Advanced interconnect systems require higher technology printed circuit materials to ensure the performance and reliability of the electronic system and to improve the manufacturability of the interconnect platform. Printed circuit board fabricators and electronic equipment manufacturers require advanced printed circuit materials that have increasingly higher temperature tolerances and more advanced and stable electrical properties in order to support high-speed computing in a miniaturized and often portable environment. Temperature tolerance was further emphasized by the advent of lead-free assemblies.
 
The uniformity, purity, consistency, performance predictability, dimensional stability and production tolerances of printed circuit materials have become successively more critical due to the very high density circuit demands of miniaturized high performance interconnect systems. High density printed circuit boards and interconnect systems often involve higher layer count multilayer circuit boards where the multiple planes of circuitry and dielectric insulating substrates are very thin (dielectric insulating substrate layers may be 0.002 inch or less) and the circuit line and space geometries in the circuitry plane are very narrow (0.002 inch or less). In addition, advanced surface mount interconnect systems are typically designed with very small pad sizes and very small plated through-holes or vias which electrically connect the multiple layers of circuitry planes, and these interconnect systems frequently make use of multiple lamination cycles and/or laser drilled vias. High density interconnect systems must utilize printed circuit materials whose dimensional characteristics and purity are consistently manufactured to very high tolerance levels in order for the printed circuit board fabricator to attain and sustain acceptable product yields.

Shorter product life cycles and competitive pressures have induced electronic equipment manufacturers to bring new products to market and increase production volume to commercial levels more quickly. These trends have highlighted the importance of front-end engineering of electronic products and have increased the level of collaboration among system designers, fabricators and printed circuit materials suppliers. As the complexity of electronic products increases, materials suppliers must provide greater technical support to interconnect systems fabricators on a timely basis regarding manufacturability and performance of new materials systems.
 
Printed Circuit Materials – Products and Services
 
The Company produces a broad line of advanced printed circuit materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnect systems, including backplanes, high speed/low loss multilayers and high density interconnects (“HDIs”). The Company’s diverse advanced printed circuit materials product line is designed to address a wide array of end-use applications and performance requirements.
 
The Company’s printed circuit materials products have been developed internally and through long-term development projects with its principal suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through licensing arrangements.

During the Company’s 2017 fiscal year, 16.2% of the Company's total worldwide sales were to TTM Technologies, Inc., a leading manufacturer of printed circuit boards. During the Company’s 2016 fiscal year, approximately 13.8% of the Company's total worldwide sales were to TTM Technologies, Inc. During the Company’s 2015 fiscal year, the Company did not have sales to any customer that equaled or exceeded 10% of the Company’s total worldwide sales. During the Company’s 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, sales to no other customer of the Company equaled or exceeded 10% of the Company’s total worldwide sales. 
 
Although the Company’s printed circuit materials business is not dependent on any single customer, the loss of a major customer or of a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
 
The Company’s printed circuit materials products are marketed primarily by sales personnel and, to a lesser extent, by independent distributors and independent sales representatives in Europe and Asia. 
 
Printed Circuit Materials – Manufacturing
 
The process for manufacturing multilayer printed circuit materials is capital intensive and requires sophisticated equipment as well as clean-room environments. The key steps in the Company’s manufacturing process include: the impregnation of specially designed fiberglass cloth with a specially designed resin system and the partial curing of that resin system; the assembling of laminates consisting of single or multiple plies of prepreg and copper foil in a clean-room environment; the vacuum lamination of the copper-clad assemblies under simultaneous exposure to heat, pressure and vacuum; and the finishing of the laminates to customer specifications.
 
Prepreg is manufactured in a treater. A treater is a roll-to-roll continuous machine which sequences specially designed fiberglass cloth or other reinforcement fabric into a resin tank and then sequences the resin-coated cloth through a series of ovens which partially cure the resin system into the cloth. This partially cured product or prepreg is then sheeted or paneled and packaged by the Company for sale to customers, or used by the Company to construct its copper-clad laminates.
 
 
12



The Company manufactures copper-clad laminates by first setting up in a clean room an assembly of one or more plies of prepreg stacked together with a sheet of specially manufactured copper foil on the top and bottom of the assembly. This assembly, together with a large quantity of other laminate assemblies, is then inserted into a large, multiple opening vacuum lamination press. The laminate assemblies are then laminated under simultaneous exposure to heat, pressure and vacuum. After the press cycle is complete, the laminates are removed from the press and sheeted, sheared and finished to customer specifications. The product is then inspected and packaged for shipment to the customer.
 
The Company manufactures multilayer printed circuit materials at fully integrated facilities located in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia. The Company opened its California facility in 1965, its Arizona facility in 1984, its Singapore facility in 1986 and its France facility in 1992. The Company services the North American market principally through its United States manufacturing facilities, the European market principally through its manufacturing facilities in the United States and in France, and the Asian market principally through its Singapore manufacturing facility. By maintaining technical and engineering staffs at each of its manufacturing facilities, the Company is able to deliver fully-integrated products and services on a timely basis. On April 18, 2017, the Company announced the consolidation of its Nelco Products, Inc. business unit located in California and its Neltec, Inc. business unit located in Arizona. When completed, all manufacturing at the Fullerton, California facility will cease, except for treating operations, which will continue as part and under the supervision of the Neltec, Inc. business unit. 
 
Printed Circuit Materials – Materials and Sources of Supply
 
The principal materials used in the manufacture of the Company’s printed circuit materials products are specially manufactured copper foil, fiberglass and quartz cloth and synthetic reinforcements, and specially formulated resins and chemicals. The Company develops and maintains close working relationships with suppliers of these materials who have dedicated themselves to complying with the Company’s stringent specifications and technical requirements. While the Company’s philosophy is to work with a limited number of suppliers, the Company has identified alternate sources of supply for many, but not all, of these materials. However, there are a limited number of qualified suppliers of these materials, in some cases substitutes for these materials are not always readily available, and, in the past, the industry has experienced shortages in the market for certain of these materials. While the Company considers its relationships with its suppliers to be strong, a shortage of these materials or a disruption of the supply of materials caused by a natural disaster, such as the temporary disruption caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011, or otherwise, could materially increase the Company’s cost of operations and could materially adversely affect the business and results of operations of the Company. 
 
Significant increases in the cost of materials purchased by the Company could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations if the Company were unable to pass such increases through to its customers. During the 2017, 2016 and 2015 fiscal years, the Company experienced significant volatility in the cost of copper foil, one of the Company’s primary raw materials. The Company generally passes changes in the costs of its raw materials through to its customers.

Printed Circuit Materials – Competition
 
The multilayer printed circuit materials industry is characterized by intense competition and ongoing consolidation. The Company’s competitors are primarily divisions or subsidiaries of very large, diversified multinational manufacturers which are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Company and, to a lesser degree, smaller regional producers. Because the Company focuses on the higher technology segment of the printed circuit materials market, technological innovation, quality and service, as well as price, are significant competitive factors.
 
The Company believes that there are several significant multilayer printed circuit materials manufacturers in the world and many of these competitors have significant presences in the three major global markets of North America, Europe and Asia. The Company believes that it is one of only a few significant independent manufacturers of multilayer printed circuit materials in the world today.
 
The markets in which the Company’s printed circuit materials operations compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, and the Company’s position in these markets depends largely on its continued ability to develop technologically advanced and highly specialized products. Although the Company believes it is an industry technology leader and directs a significant amount of its time and resources toward maintaining its technological competitive advantage, there is no assurance that the Company will be technologically competitive in the future, or that the Company will continue to develop new products that are technologically competitive.
 
Backlog
 
The Company considers an item as backlog when it receives a purchase order specifying the number of units to be purchased, the purchase price, specifications and other customary terms and conditions. At May 1, 2017, the unfilled portion of all purchase orders received by the Company and believed by it to be firm was $14,642,952, compared to $17,901,725 at May 1, 2016. A major portion of the Company’s backlog consists of composite materials.
 
Various factors contribute to the size of the Company’s backlog. Accordingly, the foregoing information may not be indicative of the Company’s results of operations for any period subsequent to the fiscal year ended February 26, 2017.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company holds several patents and trademarks or licenses thereto. In the Company’s opinion, some of these patents and trademarks are important to its products. Generally, however, the Company does not believe that an inability to obtain new; or to defend existing, patents and trademarks would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Employees
 
At February 26, 2017, the Company had 426 employees. Of these employees, 370 were engaged in the Company’s manufacturing operations, and 56 consisted of executive, sales and marketing and research and development personnel and general administrative staff. 
Environmental Matters
 
The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation of its use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and the release of emissions into the environment. The Company believes that it currently is in substantial compliance with the applicable Federal, state and local and foreign environmental laws and regulations to which it is subject and that continuing compliance therewith will not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. The Company does not currently anticipate making material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for its existing manufacturing operations during the remainder of its current fiscal year or its succeeding fiscal year. However, developments, such as the enactment or adoption of even more stringent environmental laws and regulations, could conceivably result in substantial additional costs to the Company.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or a comparable state agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund Act”) or similar state law as potentially responsible parties in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at four sites. 
 
Under the Superfund Act and similar state laws, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste disposal site or contaminated area identified by the EPA or comparable state agency may be jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup. Generally, these sites are locations at which numerous persons disposed of hazardous waste. In the case of the Company’s subsidiaries, generally the waste was removed from their manufacturing facilities and disposed at the waste sites by various companies which contracted with the subsidiaries to provide waste disposal services. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been accused of or charged with any wrongdoing or illegal acts in connection with any such sites. The Company believes it maintains an effective and comprehensive environmental compliance program. Management believes the ultimate disposition of known environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, capital resources, business, consolidated results of operations or financial position of the Company.
