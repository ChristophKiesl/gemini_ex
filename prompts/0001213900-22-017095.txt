 Item 1. Business.



Overview



We are a Delaware corporation structured as a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting our initial business combination.



We are focused on the intersection of consumer and impact, including companies focused on creating both shareholder value and a positive impact in society and culture. Our prospective target companies may seek to address principles related to environmental, social and governance concerns, which may include diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), accessibility, climate and sustainability, or a form of giving back to the community. As part of this intersection, the lines of business of prospective target companies may include, among others, direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) brands, consumer products, consumer packaged goods, apparel and fashion, food, health and wellness, fin-tech, financial services, sports, media and education. We are seeking to identify a business in the consumer sector that will benefit from The Najafi Companies’ (“Najafi”) extensive investment and operational expertise, as well as the strategic involvement of our Co-Sponsor and Co-Chairman, Mr. Colin Kaepernick (“Kaepernick”), a globally recognized athlete, accomplished investor and entrepreneur, and dedicated philanthropist who has mobilized an international following in response to his social and cultural leadership. Our strategy aligns with the following macro themes, all of which underscore our mission to invest in and grow a business in a way that delivers a significant impact financially, culturally and socially:

I. | Consumers are investing in brands that reflect their social values and recognize that purchasing decisions can act as instruments of change.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


II. | Companies are becoming more mission-driven, aligning financial and social value drivers.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


III. | Brands are evolving into media platforms, enabling authentic cultural and celebrity influencers to help drive awareness, marketing exposure and value.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The mission of the Najafi/Kaepernick partnership is to identify, acquire and advance a company with the aim of creating meaningful financial and societal value.



Initial Public Offering



On March 5, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 34,500,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $345,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,933,333 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $8,900,000.



A total of $345,000,000, comprised of $338,100,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering, net of underwriter’s cash discount and $6,900,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Jahm Najafi, our Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chairman, and Colin Kaepernick, our Co-Chairman. We must complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023, 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by March 5, 2023, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



Our Co-Sponsors



We believe that the experience and distinguished track record of our Co-Sponsors, directors and officers, and our strategic advisors will make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses and allow us to bring substantial value to the company post-business combination. Additionally, we believe the proprietary sourcing channels and extensive relationship network of our directors and officers, and from our affiliation with Najafi, combined with our investing, operating, value creation, capital markets and marketing expertise, provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage.

Environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) investing continues to grow in significance with both institutional and retail investors, and its alignment with consumer behavior continues to grow as well. We have observed that companies increasingly seek to become more mission-driven through the adoption of clear and transparent ESG frameworks.



It is upon this basis that, upon meeting in 2018, the Najafi team and Mr. Kaepernick formed a strategic relationship. The team, along with our strategic advisors, offers rare and significant skill sets to help a company shape and execute on its ESG and DEI programs and achieve a “mission-driven brand advantage.” This “advantage” benefits and differentiates the company by driving cultural relevance, consumer/employee loyalty, and ultimately growth and shareholder value creation as people increasingly emphasize buying from, working for, and investing in these types of companies.



Najafi and Kaepernick’s commitment to their social mission is reflected in the formation of the independent board, made up of 100 percent Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) and has a female majority. In addition, our team has launched an initiative to provide opportunities for college students from underrepresented communities to gain access to fellowships and full-time opportunities in business and finance.



As BlackRock’s Larry Fink said in his famous 2019 letter to CEOs: “Profits are in no way inconsistent with purpose — in fact, profits and purpose are inextricably linked… Purpose guides culture, provides a framework for consistent decision-making, and, ultimately, helps sustain long-term financial returns for the shareholders of your company.”



The Najafi Companies



An affiliate of MAC Holdings 1220, LLC the managing member of our sponsor, Najafi is a private investment firm that has been successfully evaluating, acquiring, growing and monetizing businesses since 2002 and has a strong track record of creating value for shareholders, employees and partners within our target sectors. We believe that Najafi’s hands-on experience, value creation expertise, principled investing, and distinguished track record, alongside Mr. Kaepernick, our directors and strategic advisors, make us an attractive partner to potential target companies and allow us to bring substantial and differentiated value post-business combination.



Our officers, directors, Najafi and our advisors have investing, operational, financial and transactional experience and bring a notable track record in global marketing, branding, product-development and unlocking social impact. We have deep expertise in identifying consumer trends and leveraging the power of relevant influencers to help drive long-term value creation.



Colin Kaepernick



We believe Mr. Kaepernick’s substantial business experience combined with his long-term leadership on racial equity and justice issues will support our success in identifying a prospective target company and adding transformational value to the combined entity. His experience, global marketability, massive audience and ability to positively impact culture have led to the formation of strategic and public partnerships with multiple global brands over the past ten years, including, among others, Nike, Disney, Netflix, Beats by Dre, Medium, Electronic Arts, Audible, and Ben & Jerry’s.



Mr. Kaepernick has helped companies propel growth, brand awareness and cultural relevance. He played an important role in the development of strategies, products, content and message to support the success of his campaigns for Nike. The success of his partnership with Nike has been acknowledged by the media: (“Colin Kaepernick pushes Nike’s market value up $6 billion” (Fortune, published on September 23, 2018); “Nike sales are up 31% since the Kaepernick campaign” (NBC News, published on September 10, 2019); “Nike’s Colin Kaepernick ad created over $163mm in buzz” (CNBC, published on September 6, 2018); “Nike’s Kaepernick ad draws record likes on social media, sends stock to all-time high amid sales boost” (CNBC, published on September 14, 2018)).



As an entrepreneur and business owner, Mr. Kaepernick successfully launched his own media and publishing companies, Kaepernick Publishing and RA Vision Media. High-profile consumer companies in which he has invested have benefited from his focus on ESG/DEI activities and the integration of a social impact narrative. These include high growth private consumer companies such as SpaceX, Apeel, Mmhmm, Valence and Bunch. Kaepernick also serves as a director of Medium, one of the leading online publishing companies founded by Evan Williams, the co-founder of Twitter.



Post business combination, we expect Najafi/Kaepernick to remain actively involved in the target company, including but not limited to: Board responsibilities, operations and marketing. It is the intent of the Najafi/Kaepernick partnership that our focus, dedication and commitment to the target company continue over the long-term.

Market Opportunity



We believe several macro themes will dominate the consumer space and adjacent ecosystems and present significant opportunities. We are focusing on businesses that leverage the following macro themes:



I. Consumers are investing in brands that reflect their social values and recognize that purchasing decisions can act as instruments of change.



Consumers increasingly expect brands to have a social mission and play a role in addressing societal causes. These kinds of companies are considered “mission-driven.” According to Cone/Porter Novelli, published in 2019, “US consumers are more likely to have a positive image of (89%), trust in (86%) and be loyal to (83%) brands that lead with purpose. Nearly eight-in-ten (79%) consumers surveyed say they feel a deeper personal connection to companies with values similar to their own. And 72% say they feel it is more important than ever to buy from companies that reflect their values. And, while millennials have the highest expectations for brands to take a stand on values, Forrester Research shows that older generations are increasingly becoming more attune to this macro trend. We believe this convergence of impact and purpose is the future of selling goods, as well as investing as more consumers “vote with their wallets.” Technology and media have empowered individuals to express their opinions and beliefs. For brands that effectively become more mission-driven we believe this can be incredibly powerful and a differentiating factor that gives them a competitive edge and drives customer loyalty and long-term growth.



II. Companies are becoming more mission-driven and seeking to align with culturally relevant social causes.



We believe customers want to buy from and promote brands that are purpose-driven and employees want to work for companies that share their values. In fact, Deloitte found that “purpose-driven companies had 40% higher levels of workforce retention than their competitors.” As a result, companies are reshaping their value proposition and business practices to address a wider array of customer needs and societal expectations. In addition, because diversity of thought, culture and experience can be drivers of innovation, growth and relevance, we believe that companies that include, empower and embrace underrepresented communities will be strategically positioned for long-term success and widespread support. According to Harvard Business Review, “diverse teams out-innovate and outperform the competition; they are 45% more likely to improve market share.” This inclusion may be in the form of diverse board of directors and executive leadership teams, partnerships with authentic celebrity influencers and by thoughtfully embracing diverse consumer communities which, by nature and according to Harvard, are periodically both underserved and attractive markets.



We believe we are living in an era of significant visibility and transparency and customers have unprecedented access to information that they can use to assess how a brand communicates, what it does and ultimately what it stands for. We believe this is more than a momentary trend or tactic, and committing to clear, transparent values and community engagement has emerged as an imperative to unlocking a company’s full potential and succeeding in a competitive environment.



III. Brands are evolving into media platforms, enabling authentic cultural and celebrity influencers to help drive awareness, marketing exposure and value.



Todays’ consumers live in a highly connected and digital world and they often interact with brands across multiple media channels, including DTC websites and major social media platforms. Consumers respond to brands that build an emotional connection, as when they are buying a product, in many ways, they are buying “a story.” In this environment, businesses can no longer afford to be faceless entities. In order for a company to survive, maintain relevance and build long-term and profitable relationships with customers, “businesses need to connect with audiences, pull at their heartstrings, and engage with them on a much deeper level than seen before. That’s where brand storytelling comes in.” (Forbes, published on January 31, 2019)



Having access to the appropriate ambassador who represents values that are credible and culturally relevant and who can leverage their own media platforms in a scalable and authentic way can provide meaningful competitive advantages to a brand. Affiliation with cultural icons can guide consumer preferences towards certain brands and away from others. Particularly in the last several years, these public figures have not only been transforming a company’s story through marketing and branding, but also enhancing employee morale and motivation, recruiting and leveraging their networks to help create long-term value.



We have observed that leading consumer companies continue to look for new ways to deploy their assets, community of customers, IP and infrastructure. This can include, for example, positioning their brand as a platform to build Sub-Brands, create joint ventures, and acquire bolt-on acquisitions. Businesses are able to capitalize on a platform model by leveraging existing capabilities, media and data to tailor new products or services to underserved demographics and a broader and more global customer base.

Business Strategy



We believe that we are well positioned to identify attractive initial business combination opportunities at the intersection of consumer and impact. We also believe our team’s extensive track record of value creation as investors, active owners and operators within leading consumer brands will position us to identify prospective target companies that will drive attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.



Our acquisition and value creation strategy has been and will continue to be to identify, acquire and grow a company that complements the experience of our team and can benefit from its strategic and operational expertise, as well as the multi-dimensional value derived from Mr. Kaepernick’s active involvement and long-term support. Mr. Kaepernick possesses deep expertise across all aspects of consumer strategy, insights, product development, marketing and social impact. This experience, combined with his mainstream popularity, massive reach and high-profile relationships will drive particularly attractive investment opportunities and bring significant global awareness and value creation to our target company.



We expect that post business combination, Mr. Kaepernick will remain a highly engaged owner, Board member and “global ambassador”. Because of this, we believe the target company will benefit tremendously from the authentic and long-term association of Mr. Kaepernick, starting with the excitement and marketing exposure from the public announcement of the business combination. Mr. Kaepernick is focused on shareholder value creation and he will forgo the otherwise significant contractual upfront payments that are typically paid to individuals to promote a brand. We believe this will provide significant long-term value and attractive competitive advantages to the target company.



The consumer marketplace can be noisy and complicated. We believe a company’s clarity around its values can transform a business and rally a movement around social causes that benefits all stakeholders. We believe our team can strengthen and advance a company that is addressing systemically consequential issues through its commercial activities, products and services in ways that accelerate business growth, and improve overall long-term value. Our strategy may include positioning the target company as a platform for future add-on acquisitions or developing Sub-Brands with the goal of offering a broad range of products or services. These Sub-Brands could be tied to our celebrity network and overall mission and can help expand a target company’s customer base in an effective and sustainable way.



Over its 20-year history, the Najafi team has been a highly selective investor in the marketplace with a focus on downside risk protection and long-term value creation. Najafi has utilized a strategy of concentrating its resources, capital and time on a few select investments per year in contrast to a traditional diversification strategy which is known for spreading its resources and focus across many companies. We believe this disciplined and focused approach offers relevant and timely experience that will position us to effectuate a successful business combination and remain actively involved and focused on the long-term growth of the target company.



We believe that the experience of our directors and officers, Najafi and our strategic advisors in building and executing strategies that combine identifying, mentoring and recruiting world-class talent, implementing operational improvements, branding, marketing and unlocking “impact” differentiates our ability to both source and grow a successful target company. In our selection process, we are leveraging the deep relationship network, industry experience, and direct deal sourcing capabilities of our directors and officers, Najafi and our strategic advisors to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities. In particular, Mr. Kaepernick’s involvement and high-profile network combined with the profile and relationships Najafi has built over 20 years is allowing us to access proprietary deal flow.



Competitive Advantages



We are capitalizing on the ability of our team to identify, acquire, and grow a business that will benefit from their involvement by utilizing the following differentiating factors to our advantage:

I. | Operational, Transaction and Management Expertise with a Proven Track Record of Investing in Businesses
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


II. | Direct Access to Proprietary Deal Flow
----+---------------------------------------


III. | Highly Differentiated Platform to Unlock Growth and Catalyze Social Impact
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


IV. | Network of High-Profile Relationships Can Accelerate Growth and Value-Creation
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Operational, Transaction and Management Expertise with a Proven Track Record of Investing in Businesses



Our directors and officers, Najafi and our strategic advisors have extensive experience investing, operating and growing businesses. In particular, Najafi has a distinguished track record of delivering long-term value for two decades across multiple market cycles. Najafi is nimble and able to move quickly when opportunities arise with an emphasis on long-term gains rather than short-term results. Najafi has institutional knowledge, processes, systems and skillsets that have been developed over years that offer fundamental benefits to source, evaluate, transact and remain actively involved to create long term value post-business combination.

Najafi provides expertise in operational improvements, recruiting and mentoring, developing and implementing multi-phase corporate strategies and operating businesses in sectors that are underserved, undergoing rapid transformation or technological disruption. We believe Najafi’s financial sophistication, with extensive experience in M&A, divestitures, leveraged buy outs, capital deployment, credit analysis and capital structures will be highly valuable for ensuring a successful business combination. We believe that combining Najafi’s transactional and operational involvement with the collective expertise of our directors and officers, Najafi and our strategic advisors in consumer trends, marketing, branding and impact, positions our team to deliver long-term stockholder value.



Najafi has also developed an internal framework and set of principles that guide the firm’s actions and acts as a filter for the team to determine if an investment into a company will positively contribute to society or culture. This framework is intended to underline the importance the firm places on discipline, patience, and principles and emphasize our team’s desire to work with partners who align with our values.



As an owner of both a media and a publishing company and through his partnerships with world-class brands, Mr. Kaepernick provides expertise building and managing businesses, setting and implementing strategies, transacting with large multi-nationals and creating global marketing and PR operations and campaigns. Mr. Kaepernick’s track record investing and his success leveraging his likeness, intellectual property and platform is distinguished and rare. We believe his understanding of how to interweave mission-driven principles into an operating company in ways that are both authentic and accelerate growth will be attractive and valuable for our prospective target company.



II. Direct Access to Proprietary Deal Flow



Najafi has a long-established presence in the investment community and has built a strong profile, streamlined operation and proven track record that has led to a significant influx of sourcing opportunities over the past 20 years. Najafi has acquired businesses from proprietary referral sources; executed deals with private owners and founders; participated in traditional bank processes; co-invested with venture capital and private equity funds; executed multiple carve-outs; and, participated in informal processes with boutique advisory firms and in special situations that require a time-sensitive turnaround. This is in part due to Najafi’s reputation, past experiences and ability to be management-friendly in regard to operations and strategy and nimble in regard to deal-making. We believe Najafi’s diverse experience and network of relationships benefits our company with differentiated sourcing opportunities.



Our officers and directors, Najafi and our strategic advisors have developed a broad network of relationships in the target sector including with entrepreneurs, leading high growth venture capitalists, C-suite executives, directors and advisors that we believe will further complement our sourcing pipeline of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources which may include investment banking firms, venture capital and private equity firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.



Mr. Kaepernick consistently receives a significant amount of incoming investment, acquisition, and partnership opportunities including many that are exclusive and proprietary. We believe Mr. Kaepernick’s public profile, track record creating value for top consumer brands and experience being an investor in mission-driven consumer businesses will continue to result in a robust pipeline of proprietary deal-flow. We believe his involvement and leadership role will generate global media attention and provide a substantial, differentiated and attractive funnel of sourcing opportunities. In addition, his unique access and high-profile relationships provide our team with competitive advantages and enhance our overall value proposition to target companies.



III. Highly Differentiated Platform to Unlock Growth and Catalyze Social Impact



Our platform is a combination of the significant experience, expertise, capabilities, resources and relationships of our director and officers, Najafi and our strategic advisors. We will leverage our differentiated and highly relevant platform for today’s consumer businesses to strengthen and advance a company that is addressing systemically consequential issues through its commercial activities, products and services, with the aim of creating meaningful financial and societal value post-business combination.





5







We believe our directors and officers, Najafi and our strategic advisors can provide significant value to a company post-business combination in the following ways:




● | Introducing Mr. Kaepernick as a Dedicated, Long-term Owner and Brand Steward: Become a pivotal and public-facing champion of the brand and use the nature of a public markets transaction to deliver immediate global awareness, cultural relevance and increased credibility 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supporting Alignment of Financial and Social Value Drivers in the Business alongside Clear and Transparent ESG Principles: Help define, enhance the scope and breadth and/or maximize impact in society and culture 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Contributing to Branding, Storytelling, PR, Social Media, and Content: Enhance positioning and brand story, and double down on premium content and direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) customer experience 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimizing Marketing: Leverage data and consumer insights to increase customer acquisition, engagement and lifetime value 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Driving Operational Improvements: Help drive operating efficiency and strategy

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring Platform Strategy Utilizing High-Profile Network: Leverage as a “platform” to launch collaborations with celebrity influencers and drive inorganic growth via Sub-Brands, JVs and/or bolt-on transactions 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Harnessing Data-Driven Marketing & Insights: Utilize relationships, analytical tools, strategies and insights to help personalize, predict and deliver customers’ needs and wants through data science 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding: Explore new products, categories, channels, demographics, licenses and target geographies 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




IV. Network of Unique and High-Profile Relationships can Accelerate Growth and Value-Creation



Strong relationships have been at the center of the careers of our directors and officers, Najafi and our strategic advisors. Building a personal network of relationships over many years with individuals, many of whom are leaders in their fields, including consumer, storytelling and entertainment, finance, ESG, sports, politics and education, has proven to be valuable to our collective performance, capabilities and profile, and we believe especially additive across each phase of our SPAC and business combination.



Colin Kaepernick’s Vast, Highly Relevant Network



Mr. Kaepernick possesses a vast network of high-profile and supportive relationships including titans of industry, Silicon Valley pioneers, leading venture capitalists, globally recognized musicians, athletes, actors and business and cultural leaders who are actively addressing diversity, inclusion, climate and sustainability, accessibility, and ESG principles.



We believe this access to prominent founders, CEOs, celebrities and individuals, especially those who have either founded, led, endorsed or invested in many iconic consumer brands, will be a meaningful advantage to successfully source attractive deals, provide valuable perspective during diligence and create differentiated value post business combination. We believe that with Mr. Kaepernick as a long-term Director and brand ambassador, our combined network will be especially helpful to support the recruitment of world-class partners and investors and securing service providers and experts to accelerate the growth of our target company.



Najafi’s Track Record of Success with Celebrity Partners



Celebrity partners who are authentic and have massive reach and a strong connection with their audience can be a powerful advantage to a brand. This is especially advantageous for public entities due to the maximized awareness, growth potential, marketing and overall value proposition. They can also be an attractive value driver to develop additional business models and revenue-generating opportunities post-business combination including creating Sub-Brands, JVs, and bolt-on acquisitions.

Najafi has significant experience and expertise partnering with celebrities which has resulted in a network of high-profile relationships. Najafi invested in the brand studio, Beach House Group, the parent and operating company of four mission-driven consumer brands with celebrity co-founders including: Moon with Kendall Jenner in the Oral Care space; Pattern with Tracee Ellis Ross in haircare; Beis with Shay Mitchell for travel; and Florence with Millie Bobby Brown in clean beauty and cosmetics. Najafi also invested in Scarlett Johansson’s eco-friendly, plant-based skincare line, the Outset Group. Each of these direct-to-consumer companies are tied to an authentic and related social cause that provide awareness, donations and engagement. For example, Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross celebrates and serves the underrepresented community of women who have curly hair and supports a variety of organizations that empower women and people of color.



We believe the long-term involvement of the right individual, like Mr. Kaepernick, with equity ownership in a brand signals a permanent relationship, invigorates the brand and can create value across many areas including brand monetization, favorable marketing and PR, business development and enhanced consumer connection. They infuse excitement and salesforce motivation and their ability to create and self-distribute content can increase customer acquisition, engagement and lifetime value. Celebrity engagement acts as a catalyst to enhance a company’s mission-driven principles, perception and subsequent actions.



We believe our highly differentiated and high-profile network of long-term relationships and contacts, driven by Mr. Kaepernick’s involvement, will enhance our ability to attract potential target companies and accelerate the growth trajectory and profitability post-business combination.



Our Business Combination Criteria



Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target companies. We have used and will continue to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target company that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We seek to acquire a company in the consumer space and have used and will continue to use the following non-exclusive criteria for determining opportunities:

● | Would benefit from our capabilities and expertise: We are identifying companies that could benefit from our officers, directors, Najafi and Mr. Kaepernick, and our strategic advisors’ extensive experience, insights, networks, and operating and financial capabilities in addition to our “halo effect” and track record of driving growth, value and profitability 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has operations and ESG-related characteristics that align with our investment strategy: We are looking to acquire a business which aligns with our investment strategy of supporting companies that currently have or have the potential to generate a positive social impact and which have the potential to grow and create shareholder value 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Defensible business niche: We are looking to acquire one or more businesses or assets that have a leading or niche market position and that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to create barriers to entry against new competitors 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has a committed and capable management team: We are seeking companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has the potential to grow as a platform for inorganic growth: We are seeking companies that can serve as a platform for future synergistic acquisitions 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Business Combination



In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to satisfaction of such criteria. Our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses, but if the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a seeking stockholder approval or conducting a tender offer, as applicable. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination.





7







We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target business or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third- parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test.



We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.



Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets



Our team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships has provided and will continue to provide us with a substantial number of potential initial business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world, which includes private equity firms, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. This network has grown through the activities of our team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, the reputation of our team for integrity and fair dealing with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.



This network has provided our team with a flow of referrals, which in the past has resulted in numerous transactions which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that this network will provide us with multiple investment opportunities. In addition, target business combination candidates have been and may be brought to our attention by various unaffiliated sources, including participants in our targeted markets and their advisors, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.



We have engaged Moelis, a firm that specializes in business combinations on a formal basis, and to which we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation based on the terms of the transaction. We have engaged Moelis as our management determined that the use of a finder could bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us and to provide advice related to potential business combinations. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case, the fee to Moelis will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). In addition, we pay our sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our team. Other than the foregoing, there will be no finder’s fees, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions stating that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Members of our team directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.



Our officers and directors have agreed not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer, director or strategic advisor of, any other special purpose acquisition company that has publicly filed a registration statement with the SEC without our prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.



Financial Position 



With funds available for a business combination in the amount of $345,000,000 as of December 31, 2021, after payment of $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination



We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.



Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.




TYPE OF TRANSACTION | WHETHER STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL IS REQUIRED 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company. | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company. | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 




Under NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities



If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.





10







In the event that our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.



The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.



In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of Class A common stock) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors or any of their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.



Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. As of December 31, 2021, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the representative of the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of our initial public offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.





11







Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on NYSE, we will be required to comply with NYSE’s stockholder approval rules.



The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above will be contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on NYSE. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. If we amend such provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting.



If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A different voting requirement may apply to our initial business combination based on applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares, we would need only 12,937,501, or 37.5%, of the 34,500,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.



If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will




● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






12







In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.



Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.



We intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the DWAC system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of our initial public offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.



Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval



If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.





13







Delivering Stock Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights



As described above, we intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



If our initial proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until March 5, 2023.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or until March 5, 2023, to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023.



Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023 or any extended period of time that we may have to consummate an initial business combination as a result of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, if our initial stockholders, sponsor or management team acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023.





14







Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights (including redemption rights) or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.



If we do not consummate our initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $612,101 of proceeds held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2021, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of our initial public offering and our independent registered public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.



We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $612,101 (as of December 31, 2021) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. As of December 31, 2021, the amount held outside the trust account was $612,101.



Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following March 5, 2023 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.



If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by March 5, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights (including redemption rights) or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered and may continue to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Employees



We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



Our units, Class A common stock, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.



We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.



We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following March 5, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
