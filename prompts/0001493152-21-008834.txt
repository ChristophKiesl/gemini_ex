Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993 as Resort Clubs International, Inc. (“Resort Clubs”). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the United States. Galliano International Ltd. (“Galliano”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. (“pH Environmental”).
 
On April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange agreement for the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014 changing our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc.
 
In July 2012, the Company’s focus turned to acquiring patents that would protect and advance the development of new uses of opioid-related immune- therapies,
 
In December 2013, the Company formed a subsidiary, Cytocom Inc. (“Cytocom”), to focus on conducting LDN and MENK clinical trials in the United States. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom to its shareholders. As part of the transaction (“Original Agreement”), the Company transferred to Cytocom certain of its rights, title and interest in or relating to intellectual property (i) patents, patent applications, and all divisional, continuations and continuations-in-part thereof, together with all reissues, reexaminations, renewals and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such divisionals, continuations and continuations-in-part, reissues, reexaminations, renewals and extensions, and all utility models and statutory invention registrations and any other such analogous rights, (ii) trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, trade dress, trade styles, logos, trade names, services names, brand names, corporate names, assumed business names and general intangibles and other source identifiers of a like nature, together with the goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, and all registrations and applications for registrations thereof, together with all renewals and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals and extensions, (iii) copyrights, mask work rights, database and design rights, moral rights and rights in Internet websites, whether registered or unregistered and whether published or unpublished, all registrations and recordings thereof and all applications in connection therewith, together with all renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions, and (iv) confidential and proprietary information, including, trade secrets and know-how.

On May 1, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement (the “Restated Agreement”) with Cytocom. The Restated Agreement restates the licensing arrangement between the Company and Cytocom as provided by the Original Agreement. The Restated Agreement grants the Company distribution and marketing rights for Lodonal™ and MENK for humans in certain Emerging Markets. In addition, the Company has been granted the rights to distribute and market Lodonal™ and MENK for animal use in the United States. The royalty due to Cytocom has been reduced from 5% to 1% of sales and the Company no longer has any ongoing obligations to pay for costs in connection with the assets of Cytocom. While the Company formalized the agreement to deconsolidate on May 1, 2018, Cato Research Ltd and Penn State University, both vendors of the Company, did not consent to assign the payables to Cytocom.
 
On June 4, 2018, the Company and Cytocom entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Agreement”). Pursuant to the Stock Agreement, the Company cancelled approximately $4,000,000 of debt owed to it by Cytocom in exchange for ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding common stock of Cytocom, as calculated on a fully diluted basis. The Restated Agreement was a condition of the Stock Agreement.
 
On April 8, 2019, the Company signed a second amendment to its licensing agreement (the “Second Amendment”) with Cytocom. The Second Amendment confirmed that, as of its effective date (December 31, 2018) the Company owned 15.57% of the common shares issued and outstanding on that date. The Company agreed to assume the obligation to repay all accounts payable obligations and accrued liabilities owed by Cytocom as of the effective date, except those accounts’ payable obligations and accrued liabilities as specified in the Second Amendment. The Company also assumed the obligation to repay all notes payable, together with any interest or fees payable thereon, owed by Cytocom as of the effective date, except those notes’ payable obligations, together with any interest or fees payable thereon, as specified by the Second Amendment. The parties further agreed that in the event of a change of control of Cytocom, and at the option of Cytocom, the Company would have the right to purchase outright the Company’s licensing rights to Emerging Markets for humans under the License Agreement at a price equal to value of those licensing rights as determined by and independent valuator acceptable to the Company and Cytocom.
 
Original Restructuring Strategy
 
In October 2019, the Board of Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (“Immune”) approved the restructuring of Immune (“Original Restructuring Strategy”), which included a conversion of Immune promissory notes (the “Convertible Notes”) into a proposed new class of Series D Preferred equity. However, Immune was unable to obtain the requisite shareholder approval to issue the Series D Preferred equity, so that the plan to convert the debt into a Series D could not be completed. At the same time, the Shareholders did approve a 1- for 1000 reverse stock split (“Reverse Stock Split”).
 
Due to its inability to move forward on the proposed plan the Company has been forced to pursue alternatives to the Original Restructuring Strategy. In an effort to realize the potential value of its technology positions, the Board directed management to pursue possible sublicensing options with Forte and with Cytocom (with which it holds an equity interest.)
 
In the first quarter 2020 the Reverse Stock Split was submitted and approved by the State of Florida. In June 2020, the Company received notification that its application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency (“FINRA”) had been denied due to a deficiency cited in the Company’s capitalization. In March 2021, the Company refiled its application with FINRA for approval of its 1 for 1000 Reverse Stock Split. To date no action has been taken by FINRA. Management believes it has resolved the deficiency as reflected in the re-application to FINRA.
 
On February 27, 2020, the Company approved and entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Forte Biotechnology International Corp. (“Forte”). As of April 15, 2021, this license agreement has not been executed as Forte has failed to fund the consideration defined in the agreement. Under the License Agreement, the Company granted Forte an exclusive license to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products consisting of Lodonal and MENK for use in veterinary applications for all indications world-wide. Milestone payments and royalties are defined in the agreement based on development and royalties are based on sales during the license period.
 
The Initial License Fee totals includes the assumption of Company defaulted Notes and certain other liabilities. Forte will assume defaulted debt and certain accounts payable and accrued liabilities of the Company. The note holders and vendors associated with the assigned liabilities have not yet assigned their rights to Forte.

Negotiated Consideration for February 28, 2020 License to Forte
 

Consideration Assumption of: | |

The documentation associated with the Forte license has yet to be signed and the individual lenders need to provide their approval for the transfer of these notes. As such, the accompanying financial statements do not reflect any gain on sale. Until such time as the transaction is completed, Forte does not have clear title and interest to the veterinary rights.
 
On May 13, 2020, the Company and Cytocom entered into Amendment to The Second Amendment to The License Agreement (“Third Amendment”) that was effective December 31, 2018. The sublicense provides Cytocom with the Company’s previously licensed rights for LDN and Menk in Emerging Markets. Terms for consideration for the sublicense were not finalized until August 12, 2020, at which time Cytocom and the Company signed a letter agreement in which Cytocom agreed to assume a combination of defaulted Notes plus certain other liabilities. The Company agreed to transfer all their rights, title, and interest to Cytocom in technology licensed from Penn State Research Foundation in exchange for Cytocom assuming all past due and future obligations under the Penn State license.
 
In the third quarter of 2020, the Company received a Notice of Default (“Notice”) from Cytocom relating to the sublicensing transaction. The Company disputes the validity of the Notice on the basis that Cytocom has failed to execute on their consideration for the license.
 
As of April 4, 2021, the accounts payable, accruals and employee obligations transfers has not been fully executed. The Notes in default have been assigned and the transfer signed off by the creditors, but Cytocom still has not completed the assumption of the agreed upon obligations.

Assuming that the sublicensing transactions with Cytocom and Forte are completed as described herein, the Company has no operating assets which it intends to commercialize. Therefore, as described below, the Company will continue to explore opportunities to restructure its capital position and, if successful, resume its focus on commercializing pharmaceutical products.
 
Current Restructuring Strategy
 
Management recognizes that the Company cannot move forward without adequate capital resources. The transactions with Cytocom and Forte do not provide any new working capital to the Company.
 
As a result, Management is currently pursuing a strategy to re-capitalize the Company and position it for future growth. Key steps in the process include:
 

● | Re-apply to secure FINRA approval for the previously approved reverse stock split. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improve the condition of the Company’s financial position and balance sheet: 


○ | License, where practical technologies which the Company will otherwise not be able to commercialize. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Seek additional capital to continue to maintain operations and compliance with OTC reporting requirements. 
○ | Seek funding from current Note Holders with exercisable warrants to convert such warrants as a means of raising capital and reducing outstanding debt. 


● | Identify and seek to acquire late-stage assets for future commercialization. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Build out an appropriate operational infrastructure, generate new opportunities and grow shareholder value.

 
If the Company is unable to secure new working capital, other alternatives strategies will be required.
 
Rationale for Current Restructuring Strategy
 
Historically, the Company has been able to acquire and develop assets, spin them out and retain both an equity stake and royalties and milestone payments. In so doing, the Company has acted as an incubator for drug development. Management believes that this strategy can continue to be successful.
 
There can be no guaranties that the Company will be successful in:
 

● | Executing its restructuring plan 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
● | Securing adequate capital to continue operations. 
● | Identifying and acquiring assets for future development.

 
The Company has rights to the following intellectual property, which have been substantially licensed from Forte and Cytocom, as described above. None of which have active programs to commercialize at this time:

Competition
 
The industry for treatment of humans is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our technology rights provide our sublicenses with competitive advantages. Our sub-licensees will face potential competition from many different sources including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
 
Many of our sublicensee’s potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, those competitors may be more successful than our sublicensees’ may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Their competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug our sublicensees may commercialize and may render their product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before they can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of their product candidates. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions our sub licensees are targeting could render their drugs non-competitive or obsolete. The ability of our sublicensees to overcome competitive factors will materially impact the value of our equity holdings in such licensees.
