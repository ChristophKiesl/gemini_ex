ITEM 1. Business
Our Company
 
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics and solutions aimed at intercepting and preventing immune-mediated diseases. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, business planning, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets, partnering and raising capital. Our business is subject to significant risks and uncertainties and we will be dependent on raising substantial additional capital before it becomes profitable and it may never achieve profitability.
 
We have not generated any revenue to date and through December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $79.1 million. We have financed our operations through a private offering of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in April 2017, our initial public offering, or IPO, in July 2018, and our underwritten public offering and concurrent private placement in September 2019.
 
In April 2017, we completed our private placement of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. We issued an aggregate 11,381,999 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock at $2.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $26.7 million.
 
In July 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of 15,969,563 shares of common stock in our IPO at a public offering price of $4.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, we issued to MDB, the underwriter in the IPO, and its designees warrants to purchase 1,596,956 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the IPO of $59.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $3.7 million and other offering expenses of approximately $0.8 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all of our shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of the IPO were automatically converted into an aggregate of 11,381,999 shares of common stock. In addition, the warrants issued in connection with the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock also converted to warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 558,740 shares of our common stock.
 
In September 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share. The 5,750,000 shares sold included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase 750,000 shares at a price of $8.00 per share. Concurrent with the underwritten public offering, we sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock to Amgen, Inc. at the public offering price of $8.00 per share in a private placement, pursuant to the terms of our License and Collaboration Agreement with Amgen Inc, dated as of November 5, 2018. Aggregate net proceeds from the underwritten public offering and the concurrent private placement were $62.7 million, net of approximately $2.8 million in underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $0.5 million.
 
We expect that over the next several years we will continue to incur losses from operations as we increase our expenditures in research and development in connection with our regulatory submissions, clinical trials and other development activities, as well as costs to support our commercialization efforts to launch teplizumab, if we receive regulatory approval in the U.S. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to terminate or delay certain development activities.
 
Strategy
 
Provention preferentially sources, repositions, transforms and advances underdeveloped or deprioritized clinical-stage, or nearly clinical-stage, therapeutic candidates targeting the interception and prevention of immune-mediated disease. Our “predict” and “pre-empt” therapeutic approach focuses on identifying at-risk patients and intervening before the targeted disease begins, re-appears, exacerbates or progresses. We believe our experience and expertise in translational medicine, immunology, and the design and execution of rapid go/no-go clinical trials makes us unique in the field of immune-mediated disease.

We have access to relevant in-licensing opportunities from industry-leading pharmaceutical companies; innovative, development-stage biotechnology companies; and world-renowned academic centers. We have obtained exclusive worldwide rights to two product candidates from MacroGenics, Inc., the acquisition of a Phase 3 clinical-stage candidate for the interception, delay or prevention of T1D and the in-license of a Phase 1 candidate for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We also in-licensed an enterovirus vaccine platform, targeting the prevention of Coxsackie Virus B (CVB) infections and the onset of T1D and celiac disease, from Vactech Ltd., or Vactech, a Finnish biotechnology company. We in-licensed a Phase 2 clinical-stage candidate from Amgen, Inc. targeting celiac disease. Lastly, we in-licensed a Phase 2 clinical-stage candidate from an affiliated entity of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen, which is a small molecule targeting an upstream pathological mechanism and believed to drive Crohn’s disease.
 
Our activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital, as described below. We have not yet commenced any revenue-generating operations, does not have any cash flows from operations, and will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations.

Clinical Data & Safety
 
PRV-031 (teplizumab, anti-CD3 mAb)
 
In June 2019, we announced results from a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with Stage 2 T1D (Teplizumab for Prevention of Type 1 Diabetes In Relatives “At-Risk”) conducted at TrialNet sites and sponsored by the NIDDK, part of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, which evaluated PRV-031, a humanized, anti-CD3 mAb for the interception of T1D, in 76 patients with stage 2 T1D. The trial results showed that PRV-031 significantly delayed the median onset of clinical diabetes from 24.4 months (placebo) to 48.4 months (teplizumab) (p=0.006). PRV-031 is the first potential immune modulator therapy that has demonstrated a delay in the onset of clinical disease in T1D.
 
The results from At-Risk study were reported at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June 2019 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A total of 76 subjects were enrolled and randomized, 44 to teplizumab and 32 to placebo. The safety profile in At-Risk subjects who received a single course of teplizumab was consistent with those from subjects with newly-diagnosed clinical T1D who received two courses of the drug.
 
In August 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted breakthrough therapy designation (“BTD”) to PRV-031 for the delay or prevention of clinical T1D in individuals at-risk of developing the disease. BTD is an FDA program designed to expedite the development and review of therapeutic candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases.
 
In October 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted PRIority MEdicines (“PRIME”) eligibility to teplizumab (PRV-031) for the prevention or delay of clinical T1D in individuals at-risk of developing the disease. The PRIME initiative is designed to expedite the development and review of promising therapies that target an unmet need and show potential clinical benefit so the medicine can reach patients earlier. The designation offers the opportunity for enhanced interaction and dialogue with the EMA to optimize development, as well as the potential for accelerated assessment at the time of application for a marketing authorization.
 
In November 2019, we completed a Type B multidisciplinary meeting with the FDA to discuss the proposed contents of a BLA for PRV-031 (teplizumab) for the prevention or delay of T1D in individuals at-risk of developing T1D. Based on official FDA meeting minutes, Provention continues to expect that it will commence a rolling BLA submission for PRV-031 in the middle of 2020 and is targeting completion of the submission in the fourth quarter of 2020. We do not anticipate the need to conduct any additional clinical trials in the at-risk population prior to BLA submission.
 
PRV-3279 (humanized anti-CD32B and CD79B bispecific)
 
On March 12, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the Phase 1b portion of the PREVAIL (PRV-3279 EVAluation In Lupus) study, which evaluated PRV-3279 in 16 healthy volunteers.

PRV-3279 was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events, and as expected, did not deplete B cells and demonstrated profound and sustained binding to circulating B lymphocytes, with reduction of circulating immunoglobulin M levels in a dose-proportional manner. While anti-drug antibody production was observed at both dose levels tested, immunogenicity was found not to affect exposure, safety or pharmacodynamic parameters.
 
Based on the results, Provention plans to commence the Phase 2a portion of the PREVAIL study in lupus patients in the first half of 2021.
 
PRV-6527 (CSF-1R inhibitor)
 
In October 2019, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2a clinical trial (the PRINCE study), which evaluated PRV-6527, an oral CSF-1R small molecule inhibitor, in 93 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the change in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score at week 12. While PRV-6527 demonstrated a substantial improvement in this symptom driven score at week 12, it did not differentiate from placebo. This high placebo response is deemed to be possibly related to the standard of care and/or background medication used (~85%) in the study’s predominantly biologic-naïve population. PRV-6527 was associated with improvements in several key secondary objective endpoints in the steroid-free population (75% of study subjects), including mucosal endoscopy (as assessed by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease, SES-CD) and tissue histology (as measured by the Global Histological Activity Score, GHAS). Analysis of exploratory serum and tissue biomarkers showed that patients treated with PRV-6527 had significant reductions in circulatory inflammatory monocytes, as well as macrophages, dendritic cells and the CSF1 gene signature in colonic tissue, providing proof of mechanism in the interception of inflammatory myeloid cells. PRV-6527 was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events.
 
In December 2019, Janssen declined its option to buy back PRV-6527 from us for a one-time payment of $50.0 million and single-digit royalties on future net sales in inflammatory bowel disease indications. We retain the rights and are free to sublicense the program on a worldwide basis to another partner in the field of inflammatory bowel disease.
 
Our Focus and Pipeline
 
Inflammation is a natural consequence of most infections as it is the immune system’s first response to invading pathogens in the event of injury or acute illness. Most of the time, this response is beneficial and well-controlled; helping to repair tissue damage and clear pathogens from the body. In addition to directly damaging tissues and organs, an infection can sometimes result in the excessive release of toxic immune mediators leading to a potentially life-threatening acute pathological immune response. When patients have the requisite genetic predisposition, infections can also trigger chronic autoimmune responses that persist and progress long after the original insult has subsided. These sustained pathological responses have been linked to an increased susceptibility to chronic debilitating and potentially life-threatening diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, cancer, and certain neurological disorders.
 
Our “predict” and “preempt” therapeutic approach is to intercept the underlying pathological immune and inflammatory responses in susceptible individuals. Our pipeline includes:
 

● | PRV-031: a humanized, anti-CD3 mAb for the interception of T1D in pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed T1D and for delaying and/or preventing disease progression in subjects at risk of developing clinical stage T1D. PRV-031 has been designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for the treatment of newly-diagnosed T1D. PRV-031 was also granted breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in August 2019 and PRIME eligibility from the EMA in October 2019 for the delay or prevention of T1D; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PRV-101: a CVB vaccine to prevent acute CVB infections and, in those patients at risk, preventing the CVB-triggered autoimmune damage to pancreatic beta cells that progress to T1D and damage to intestinal cells that lead to celiac disease; 
● | PRV-3279: a humanized bispecific scaffold molecule targeting the B-cell surface proteins, CD32B and CD79B, for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and for the prevention of immunogenicity of biotherapeutics such as those used in gene therapy; 
● | PRV-015: a human anti-interleukin 15, or IL-15, mAb for the treatment of gluten-free diet non-responsive celiac disease, or NRCD, intercepting the effects of contaminating gluten in the most common autoimmune disorder without any approved medication; and 
● | PRV-6527: an oral small molecule CSF-1R inhibitor targeting the differentiation and activation of antigen-presenting cells, or APCs, to prevent chronic inflammatory responses and progression or relapse in Crohn’s disease.

OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES
 
PRV-031 (teplizumab; anti-CD3 antibody) for T1D
 
Type 1 Diabetes Background Information
 
T1D is the end result of immune-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas and is one of the most common and serious chronic conditions occurring in childhood. T1D patients require life-long dependence on insulin products delivered through multiple daily injections or continuous infusion pumps. While the disease presents in children and adults, the vast majority of T1D is diagnosed in children, with more than half of T1D patients diagnosed before the age of 14 years. The life-expectancy of individuals with younger-onset disease is on average 16 years shorter than non-diabetic individuals. Individuals diagnosed before the age of 10 years have a 30-times greater risk of serious cardiovascular outcomes than the general population resulting in decreased life expectancy, compared to healthy individuals. It is believed the loss of beta cells, which is more severe and rapid in younger individuals leading to increased glycemic load, is the cause of increased cardiovascular-related deaths. The disease is believed to occur in genetically susceptible individuals upon exposure to environmental triggers. In addition, because of a similar genetic predisposition, patients with T1D are at high risk of developing celiac disease. Celiac disease is characterized by autoimmunity in the gut and other organs triggered by consumption of gluten and can lead to malnutrition and other complications including a form of cancer called lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for celiac disease.
 
Lack of insulin secretory capacity has serious consequences, even when patients receive insulin replacement therapy. The complications of T1D include eye disease, nerve damage, kidney disease and heart disease. Diabetic retinopathy has a prevalence of approximately 80% among patients with T1D and is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among adults. Moreover, about 60% to 70% of people with diabetes present some form of neuropathy that can induce numbness, weakness and blood pressure dysregulation. In addition, diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and affects about 30% of T1D patients. Diabetes can also cause severe heart complications and adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes.
 
In summary, people with T1D experience substantial morbidity and mortality owing to chronic complications.
 
Current Treatment Options and Their Limitations
 
So far, no curative treatment exists for T1D. Patients with T1D still need to use daily insulin injections to manage blood sugar to within a normal range. However, it is estimated that fewer than one-third of people with T1D in the U.S. achieve target blood glucose levels and insulin injections often cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). While insulin injections or infusion allow a person with T1D to stay alive, they do not cure the disease, nor do they necessarily reduce the risk of serious effects and long-term complications of T1D.
 
While pancreatic and islet cell transplantation offer the ability to normalize glucose levels and remove the dependence on insulin products, there are significant risks. There is risk associated with mandatory immunosuppression, which commonly results in the development of infections that may be life-threatening. Furthermore, pancreas transplantation may be associated with technical complications (vascular thrombosis, pancreatitis, infection, fistulas) as well as acute and chronic organ rejection. Islet cell transplantation can provide better glycemic control and protect patients from hypoglycemic episodes, but only approximately 50% of patients are insulin-free after three years of follow-up.
 
New approaches are still required and could significantly enhance patient care. In particular, there is a strong need for new preventive or curative treatments. Among the different possible strategies, primary prevention through vaccination seems to be the best candidate considering the potential efficacy and safety balance that needs to be achieved.

T1D Market
 
According to the International Diabetes Federation, 8.8% of the adult population worldwide has diabetes, among whom 10-15% have T1D. According to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), it is estimated that 1.6 million people in the U.S. have T1D and approximately five million are expected to have T1D by 2050, including nearly 600,000 under 15 years of age. The annual economic burden of T1D has been estimated by JDRF to be greater than $30.0 billion in the U.S. and greater than $90.0 billion globally.
 
Moreover, the incidence of T1D is increasing worldwide and it is estimated that more than 90,000 children are diagnosed each year in the U.S. and the largest five European countries. In the period between 2005 and 2020, epidemiologists predict a 70% increase in the incidence of T1D in children in Europe, with the age of onset decreasing and the number of cases in children younger than five years old doubling.
 
Overview of T1D Biology and PRV-031 Mechanism of Action
 
T1D is an autoimmune disease. Specialized white blood cells of our immune system, known as self-reactive T cells (also called auto-reactive), are triggered, presumably by CVB viral infection in at least 50% of cases, to attack and destroy beta cells of the pancreas, thus causing a decline in the natural production of insulin. Simultaneously, another type of T cell, regulatory T cells, or Tregs, which normally suppress the activity of self-reactive T cells, fail to do so effectively.
 
The clinical progression of T1D is relatively well understood and predictable, as it is a continuum marked by clinically-relevant biomarkers which identify stages of the disease. In an individual with normoglycemia with genetic risk (primarily driven by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes), the natural evolution of T1D has been described in stages (see figure below).
 

● | Stage 1: emergence of T1D-related autoantibodies which reflect the initiation of the autoimmune process; this stage is associated with normoglycemia. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stage 2: persistence T1D-related autoantibodies, but with further loss of beta cell function and development of dysglycemia. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stage 3: symptomatic or clinical T1D, when remaining beta cell capacity is insufficient to maintain glucose metabolism. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stages of Type 1 Diabetes
 

It is important to note that once subjects develop two or more T1D-related autoantibodies (Stage 1), the progression to clinical T1D (Stage 3) is not a matter of “if” but “when” as greater than 95 percent of the Stage 1 subjects and virtually all of the Stage 2 subjects will progress to Stage 3 necessitating insulin dependence. The progression of Stage 1 to Stage 3 is 44% in 5 years, and of Stage 2 to Stage 3 is 75% in 5 years.

PRV-031 (teplizumab) is a humanized mAb that binds with high specificity to a cell surface protein called CD3. The CD3 protein is a co-receptor that helps activate T cells and direct different kinds of immune responses. Preclinical data suggests that binding of PRV-031 to CD3 triggers events that differentially inhibit the activation of self-reactive T cells without affecting Tregs. This restores the important state of immune tolerance and may prevent self-reactive T cells from attacking beta cells in the pancreas. When administered to Stage 2 subjects, teplizumab delayed progression and onset of clinical T1D, and when administered to Stage 3 subjects, teplizumab slowed down the loss of beta cell function in all studies conducted to date. Therefore, we believe PRV-031 has the potential to intercept the T1D disease process along the entire continuum, slowing or preventing the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells.
 
Clinical Development Program
 
Results from a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with Stage 2 T1D (Teplizumab for Prevention of Type 1 Diabetes In Relatives “At-Risk”) conducted at TrialNet sites and sponsored by the NIDDK, part of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH were reported at the American Diabetes Association meeting on June 9, 2019 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A total of 76 subjects were enrolled and randomized, 44 to teplizumab and 32 to placebo. The data show that teplizumab significantly delayed the median onset of clinical diabetes from 24.4 months (placebo) to 48.4 months (teplizumab) (p=0.006). The safety profile in At-Risk subjects who received a single course of teplizumab was consistent with those from subjects with recent-onset clinical T1D who received two courses of the drug. Teplizumab is the first potential immune modulator therapy that has demonstrated a delay in the onset of clinical disease in T1D.
 
In August 2019, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to PRV-031 for the delay or prevention of clinical T1D in individuals at-risk of developing the disease. BTD is an FDA program designed to expedite the development and review of therapeutic candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases.
 
In October 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted PRIority MEdicines (“PRIME”) eligibility to teplizumab (PRV-031) for the prevention or delay of clinical T1D in individuals at-risk of developing the disease. The PRIME initiative is designed to expedite the development and review of promising therapies that target an unmet need and show potential clinical benefit so the medicine can reach patients earlier. The designation offers the opportunity for enhanced interaction and dialogue with the EMA to optimize development, as well as the potential for accelerated assessment at the time of application for a marketing authorization.
 
In addition, we commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial in pediatric and adolescent patients with newly-diagnosed T1D (Stage 3) and a minimum level of pancreatic beta-cell function based on C-peptide levels at study entry. The study is a randomized, controlled, multi-center study being conducted in North America and Europe. The primary endpoint will evaluate the effect of PRV-031, as compared with placebo, in preserving beta cell function, measured by C-peptide secretion. Secondary endpoints will measure insulin use, HbA1c levels, time-in-range of blood glucose levels and hypoglycemic episodes. We expect to enroll approximately 300 patients. The first patient was dosed in April 2019 and we expect to report top line results in 2022.
 
We believe that combination therapy may enhance the therapeutic benefit of PRV-031 by increasing efficacy, enhancing the durability of response, or restoring insulin production by beta cells. Combination therapies may include beta-cell autoantigens, tolerogenic cytokines, other modalities which could enhance better depletion of self-reactive lymphocytes or increasing the function of Tregs, or agents that could restore beta cell function or mass. We are collaborating with Precigen (formerly Intrexon) and its subsidiary, ActoBio Therapeutics, to explore the combination of PRV-031 and the oral administration of a Lactococcus lactis strain genetically engineered to secrete human proinsulin and human interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We plan to explore other combination therapies as the Phase 3 program progresses.
 
Clinical Evaluation of PRV-031
 
To date, clinical development of PRV-031 has included both academic and biopharmaceutical sponsors. More than 1,000 subjects have been enrolled in PRV-031 clinical trials, with over 800 subjects receiving PRV-031. These studies represent various doses, formulations, and indications and includes earlier smaller investigator-sponsored studies. The enrollment of patients by therapeutic indication includes approximately 1,050 T1D patients, eight renal or renal-pancreatic allograft rejection patients, 20 induction immunotherapy in pancreatic islet transplant recipients, 11 psoriatic arthritis patients, one plaque psoriasis patient and 64 high-risk patients for the prevention or delay of onset of developing T1D.
 
In T1D patients, ten studies have been conducted, of which nine involved intravenous dosing (two Phase 1, three Phase 2, two Phase 3 and a Phase 3 extension study) and one subcutaneous dosing (Phase 1).

Among the T1D studies of PRV-031:
 

● | In Stage 2, the At-Risk study enrolled Stage 2 individuals who were characterized as having at least two T1D autoantibodies and evidence of hyperglycemia 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In Stage 3, five studies (Study 1, Study 2, Study 3, Study 4 “AbATE”, and Study 5 “Delay”) were completed under the direction of Dr. Kevan Herold (currently at Yale University) and collaborators. Studies 2, 3 and 4 were sponsored by the Immune Tolerance Network. Four additional studies were conducted by MacroGenics: three with intravenous administration (“Protégé”, “Protégé Extension”, and “Protégé Encore”) and one with subcutaneous administration (SUBCUE) of PRV-031. Among these studies, “Protégé” and “Protégé Encore” were Phase 3 studies. Protégé was the largest completed study for treatment of T1D, which enrolled 516 patients (aged 8 to 35 years and T1D diagnosis within 12 weeks of study entry) and randomized into three PRV-031 dosing regimens compared to placebo. PRV-031 showed promising immunological and clinical activities in these studies and was well tolerated. In particular, PRV-031 treatment showed promising data on the preservation of C-peptide levels and the reduction of exogenous insulin use. 

Stage 2 Program
 
Stage 2: At-Risk Study
 
The At-Risk study was developed and conducted by Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet, funded by the National Institutes of Health, the American Diabetes Association, or the ADA, and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. The objective of the study was to determine whether treatment of at-risk subjects with teplizumab results in a delay or prevention of T1D. The primary endpoint was completed in 2018. The study was conducted in 18 sites in the United States, Canada and Germany.
 
Participants over eight years of age with Stage 2 T1D (presence of at least two T1D autoantibodies and dysglycemia, who were non-diabetic relatives of T1D individuals) were randomized 1:1 to receive teplizumab or placebo. Dysglycemia was defined on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as: (a) Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 110mg/dL, and <126mgdL, or (b) 2-hour plasma glucose ≥140mg/dL, and <200mg/dL, or (c) 30, 60, or 90-minute value on OGTT ≥200mg/dL.
 
The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to the clinical diagnosis of diabetes, using ADA criteria. Criteria for T1D onset are, based on glucose testing, or the presence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation (diabetic ketoacidosis). One of the following criteria must be met on two occasions as soon as possible but no less than one day apart for diabetes to be defined:
 

● | Symptoms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration > 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l). Casual is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. The classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/l). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours. 
● | 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l). The test should be performed using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 1.75g/kg body weight to a maximum of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. 

 
Teplizumab was administered over a 14-day course: 51 μg/m2, 103 μg/m2, 207 μg/m2, and 413 μg/m2 on study days 0–3, respectively, and 826 μg/m2 on each of study days four through 13. A total of 112 participants were screened and 76 were randomized, 44 to teplizumab and 32 to placebo. The baseline characteristics were balanced for age (median ~13-14 years of age), relationship to the relative with T1D, type of T1D autoantibodies and HbA1c.
 
Treatment with a single course of teplizumab delayed the time to T1D (see figure below): 19 of the 44 (43%) teplizumab-treated and 23 of the 32 (72%) placebo-treated participants were diagnosed with T1D. The annualized rates of T1D development were 14.9% and 35.9% per year, for the teplizumab and placebo groups, respectively. The median time to T1D was 24.4 months in the placebo and 48.4 months in the teplizumab groups (hazard ratio = 0.412 (95% CI: 0.216, 0.783) p=0.006 (2-sided)).

Time to T1D
 

In pre-specified analyses, the effects of teplizumab on the primary outcome based on baseline characteristics were evaluated. Although subgroup analyses had small sample sizes and need to be taken with caution, participants without anti-ZnT8 antibodies showed a greater response to teplizumab compared to those with those who did not have the antibody. The presence of HLA-DR4 and absence of HLA-DR3 were associated with more robust responses to teplizumab, and the response to teplizumab was greater in participants whose C-peptide responses to the OGTT at baseline were below the median (1.75 nmol/L).
 
Teplizumab treatment was associated with few adverse events, described in the table below. Similar to previous studies with teplizumab in newly-diagnosed T1D patients, the lymphocyte count declined to a nadir on day five by 72.3% (IQR 82.1, 68.4%) (p<0.0001). Fifteen (34.1%) of the grade 3 events in the teplizumab group involved lymphopenia during the first 30 days after study drug administration. The lymphocyte counts recovered quickly: Lymphopenia resolved in all participants by day 45 except in one, whose counts returned on day 105. A spontaneously resolving rash, as previously noted, occurred in 36% of drug treated participants. The rates of infection were similar in the two treatment arms. The adverse events below were determined to be possibly, probably or definitely related to the study drug.

Anti-CD3 mAb treatment has been associated with Epstein Barr virus, or EBV, reactivation. At entry, 30 participants (39%) (16 teplizumab and 14 placebo) had antibodies against EBV. At weeks 3-6 after study drug treatment, there was quantifiable EBV DNA in whole blood in eight of the seropositive participants – all in the teplizumab group, one of whom had symptoms of pharyngitis, rhinorrhea, and cough on day 38. In these participants, the EBV DNA levels were below the level of quantification between day 43 and 134 (average 77 days). At entry, 17 participants (ten teplizumab and seven placebo) had antibodies against cytomegalovirus, or CMV. One teplizumab participant, who was CMV seropositive, had detectable levels of CMV DNA at day 20 that was undetectable by day 42.
 
These results demonstrate that a single course of teplizumab significantly delayed the progression to clinical T1D in high risk Stage 2 non-diabetic relatives who had at least two autoantibodies and dysglycemia. The median delay in the diagnosis of diabetes was approximately two years, and at the conclusion of the trial, the frequency of diabetes-free subjects was double in the drug (57%) vs placebo-treated subjects (28%). The relatively rapid rate of progression to clinical diabetes in the placebo group, consistent with the previously reported natural history, reflects the very high risk of these individuals and reflects the inevitability of progression from Stage 2 to Stage 3 disease, consistent with observations of high rates of beta cell killing in these subjects. The rapid development of clinical T1D may also reflect the enrichment of pediatric participants (72.4%) in whom the rate of progression is rapid.
 
Stage 3 Program
 
Protégé Study
 
Protégé was a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 83 centers in North America (U.S., Canada, Mexico), India, Israel, and Europe (Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine). Patients aged eight to 35 years with recently diagnosed T1D (≤12 weeks) were followed for 12 months (Protégé) and continued to 24 months (Protégé Extension). Three dose regimens of PRV-031 were administered to 417 patients as intravenous infusions for six to 14 days; 99 patients received placebo. At 12 months, the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients with insulin use <0.5 U/kg per day and HbA1c <6.5%, ranged from 13.7% to 20.8% patients in the PRV-031 groups, depending on dosing regimen, and 20.4% in the placebo group. The difference between PRV-031-treated patients and placebo-treated patients was not significant. The change in HbA1c from baseline also did not show a significant difference between PRV-031 and placebo. However, subgroup analyses indicated the following findings:

--


● | The primary endpoint could have been achieved if cut-offs were changed to insulin use of <0.25 U/kg per day and HbA1c <7.0%, not only at 12 months but also at 24 months (figure below).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--


● | C-peptide levels significantly improved in the PRV-031 group compared with placebo group in all patients, and further analyses indicated that this difference was more pronounced in younger patients (aged eight to 11 years) and patients enrolled in U.S. sites. These findings are consistent with other clinical trials, showing a stronger effect in T1D patients who are younger (<17 years), more recently diagnosed (<10 weeks), and with higher C-peptide levels at baseline.

Protégé Encore Study
 
Protégé Encore was a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 125 centers in 16 countries. Patients aged eight to 35 years with recently diagnosed T1D were to be followed for 24 months. Three dose regimens of PRV-031, given as intravenous infusions for six to 14 days, were compared with placebo. The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with insulin use <0.5 U/kg per day and HbA1c <6.5% at 12 months, was not met. Study enrollment was stopped at 254 patients (400 planned) when the Protégé study showed that the primary endpoint was not met. Efficacy analyses were not conducted in this study.

A summary of the C-peptide data in the completed Phase 2 clinical trials and Phase 3 Protégé study are shown in the table below. All these studies have shown consistent and significant C-peptide benefit. Furthermore, subgroup analysis of the Protégé data indicated that younger patients (aged eight to 17 years) with minimum baseline beta cell function (C-peptide >0.2 pmol/mL) along with even more robust data in newly-diagnosed T1D (diagnosis under six weeks, Study 1), informed the inclusion criteria that will be applied in our planned Phase 3 study, PROTECT.

SUBCUE Study
 
SUBCUE was a randomized, controlled Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD of subcutaneously injected PRV-031. Patients aged 18 to 35 years who were diagnosed with T1D within 12 months were to be given three dosing regimens of PRV-031 or placebo. Patients were to be followed for 91 days. However, the study was stopped after one subject was enrolled, upon the Protégé study results.
 
Safety Data
 
The majority of safety data for PRV-031 comes from two completed Phase 3 studies: Protégé and Protégé Encore. In PRV-031 and placebo-treated subjects, there were no major differences in the overall adverse events, or AEs (99.7% and 100%), and serious adverse events, or SAEs (13.2% (85 out of 645 subjects), and 9.4% (15 out of 160 subjects)), although there were more severe adverse events in PRV-031 subjects (63% and 30%). In the Protégé study, 261 of 415 (62.9%) subjects had severe adverse events compared with placebo, 28 out of 98 subjects (28.6%). In Protégé Encore, 121 of 192 (63%) subjects had severe adverse events compared with placebo, 16 out of 62 subjects (25.8%).
 
The most common AEs were decreased white blood cells including lymphopenia, leukopenia and neutropenia. Leukopenia/lymphopenia and rash were experienced most frequently by PRV-031-treated subjects. Lymphopenia was expected based on the mechanism of action of PRV-031 and was observed in approximately 70% of type-1 diabetes patients who received PRV-031; lymphopenia was reported in approximately 14% of placebo subjects. It was commonly mild to moderate and resolved within 14 days. In the Protégé study, approximately 50% and 20% of PRV-031- and placebo-treated patients, respectively, reported rash or pruritus. In PRV-031-treated patients, the rash was predominantly mild to moderate and usually resolved within one to two weeks. Laboratory abnormalities were also reported as AEs. The main differences in PRV-031 and placebo subjects were changes in lymphocyte counts (30.1% and 9.4%) and liver function test (alanine aminotransferase, 30.9% and 14.1%). These abnormalities usually resolved within 14 days of dose completion and did not cause significant or lasting clinical concern. Cytokine release syndrome, which may include symptoms of rash, headache, nausea, vomiting, and chills/fever, occurred in fewer than 6% of PRV-031-treated patients and was mild to moderate in severity.

The most common SAEs reported in the Protégé and Protégé Encore studies were related to diabetes control including diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycemic seizures/unconsciousness, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia (consistent with the underlying disorder) and were reported in 6.2% and 2.5% of PRV-031 and placebo subjects, respectively. Three deaths were observed and categorized by the principal investigator (in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice guidelines) and included in the Investigator Brochure for PRV-031 filed with the FDA. The relationship between each death and PRV-031 is listed in the Investigator Brochure as follows: one death, “none”; one death “not related”; and one death “unlikely.” The specific causes of deaths were (1) unknown for which the relationship was listed as “none” in the Investigator Brochure, (2) anterior myocardial infarction with ventricular tachycardia and cardio-respiratory arrest for which the relationship was listed as “not related” in the Investigator Brochure and (3) diabetic ketoacidosis for which the relationship was listed as “unlikely” in the Investigator Brochure. AEs of infections (most commonly gastroenteritis) were reported in 3.6% and 2.5% of PRV-031 and placebo subjects, respectively. Fifteen of 85 SAEs and five of 15 SAEs were deemed related to PRV-031 and placebo treatment, respectively.
 
The following table reflects all the SAEs reported in the Investigator Brochure for the Protégé and Protégé Encore studies:

The most common SAE occurring in at least 10% of subjects in both treatment groups in the Protégé study was decreased white blood cell counts (lymphopenia/neutropenia) observed in 47% (196 out of 415 subjects) and 10% (10 out of 98 subjects) of PRV-031 and placebo subjects, respectively. In Protégé Encore, lymphopenia/neutropenia was also the most frequently observed severe adverse event, occurring in 24% (46 out of 192 subjects) and 6% of PRV-031 (four out of 62 subjects and placebo subjects, respectively. This severe adverse event is consistent with the mechanism of action of PRV-031.
 
Overall, infections were not increased following PRV-031 treatment. However, in Protégé there were ten cases of herpes zoster infections (a virus that usually causes chicken pox or shingles) in PRV-031-treated patients that were possibly dose-related, and none in the placebo group. All of these cases were resolved. In the Protégé Encore study, only one patient, who was randomized to placebo had herpes zoster. A link between PRV-031 and herpes infections remains unclear. Other herpes virus infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus) were not increased with PRV-031 treatment.
 
Phase 3 Clinical Trial of PRV-031 in Pediatric Patients Newly-Diagnosed T1D (PROTECT Study)
 
The PROTECT study (PROvention T1D trial Evaluating C-peptide with Teplizumab) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial in pediatric and adolescent patients (aged eight to17 years) with recent-onset T1D. Patients with minimum beta-cell cell function (C-peptide >0.2 pmol/mL) and within six weeks of T1D diagnosis will receive two courses of teplizumab, six months apart. Each course will consist of 12 days of teplizumab administered intravenously. The primary endpoint is the change in C-peptide at 18 months. Secondary endpoints including insulin use, HbA1C levels, hypoglycemic events and safety will also be evaluated. The study is expected to enroll approximately 300 patients with 2:1 randomization (200 active: 100 placebo) and enrollment commenced in the second quarter of 2019. We expect to complete enrollment by the end of 2020 and report top line results for the Phase 3 PROTECT study in 2022.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of PRV-031 in combination with AG019 in newly diagnosed T1D patients
 
This is a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial being conducted in collaboration with ActoBio which will explore the combination of teplizumab with ActoBio’s AG019 in participants with recent-onset T1D. AG019 is a capsule consisting of engineered Lactococcus lactis specifically modified to deliver human proinsulin and the tolerance-enhancing cytokine human interleukin-10 to the mucosal lining of the gastro-intestinal tissues. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of AG019 alone as well as AG019 in association with teplizumab. The secondary objectives of this study are: to obtain PD data of AG019 alone as well as AG019 in association with teplizumab; and PK data to determine the potential presence of AG019 in systemic circulation (safety - systemic exposure) and the presence of L. lactis bacteria in fecal excretion (local exposure). The study will enroll 48 participants and will be conducted in two phases:
 

● | Phase 1b: open-label part of the study which will investigate the safety and tolerability of two different doses of AG019 in two age groups (18 to 40 years of age and 12 to 17 years of age). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2a: randomized, double-blind part of the study which will investigate the safety and tolerability of AG019, in association with teplizumab, in two age groups (18 to 40 years of age and 12 to 17 years of age). 

 
The Phase 1b part of the study commenced in October 2018.

Pre-Clinical Evaluation of PRV-031
 
PRV-031 binds specifically to human T cells with CD3 on the surface. It also binds to CD3+ T cells in chimpanzees, an endangered species that is inappropriate for extensive experimentation, but does not bind to CD3+ T cells of any other animal species. Due to this lack of feasible animal models, nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies are limited. Nonetheless, consistent with its mechanism of action and binding to CD3, PRV-031-treated chimpanzees showed reversible reductions in circulating T cells and a dose-dependent increase in various immune signaling molecules (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ). At very high PRV-031 doses, approximately 450-fold higher than the highest daily dose administered in humans (826 μg/m2), chimpanzees developed B cell lymphoproliferative disease (similar to lymphoma) and Epstein-Barr virus-like infection. In human tissues, PRV-031 binds to T cells in multiple human tissues without unanticipated binding to other cell types. These results indicate that PRV-031 has a low probability of producing unexpected and unintended toxicities in human clinical trials.
 
Regulatory Strategy for PRV-031
 
In November 2019, we completed a Type B multidisciplinary meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the proposed contents of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for PRV-031 (teplizumab) for the prevention or delay of T1D in individuals at-risk of developing T1D. Based on official FDA meeting minutes, Provention continues to expect that it will commence a rolling BLA submission for PRV-031 in the middle of 2020 and is targeting completion of the submission in the fourth quarter of 2020. We do not anticipate the need to conduct any additional clinical trials in the at-risk population prior to BLA submission.
 
For the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) module, the FDA confirmed that it would require the demonstration of comparability between the study drug previously manufactured by MacroGenics and Eli Lilly and the to-be-commercialized drug substance and drug product scheduled for production by Provention and its contract manufacturing partners.
 
The Type B meeting discussion with the FDA supports Provention’s belief that results from the “At-Risk” study, together with adequate confirmatory evidence from prior teplizumab studies in early onset T1D, will be sufficient for a BLA submission. The FDA provided guidance on specific analyses of data from our clinical database of over 800 patients for inclusion in the BLA submission, specifically the impact of PRV-031 on C-peptide levels in T1D patients. C-peptide is a byproduct of endogenous insulin production and a universally accepted measure of the amount of insulin naturally produced by functional beta cells in the pancreas.
 
The FDA also confirmed that the safety database from the “At Risk” study and prior teplizumab clinical studies in patients with early onset T1D appears adequate to support the submission and review of a BLA.

T1D Lifecycle Management and other potential indications
 
We are currently exploring and supporting research and lifecycle management programs for T1D beyond the current treatment regimen and patient population including, repeat dosing and age expansion for at-risk patients and newly diagnosed patients, as well as subcutaneous formulations and combination therapies potentially with antigens, metabolic drugs, immune modulators and beta cell transplants. Other potential indications for PRV-031 may include GI immunology disorders such as Crohn’s disease, Celiac disease and autoimmune hepatitis or rheumatology disorders such as psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. These initiatives may include new clinical studies sponsored by us or investigator-initiated studies, which are clinical studies initiated and sponsored by physicians or research institutions with funding from us.
 
PRV-101 (CVB Vaccine) for Acute Infection and T1D
 
Overview of CVB Infection of the Pancreas, T1D and PRV-101’s Mechanism of Action
 
Longitudinal studies of more than 200,000 children studied for up to two decades in Finland by our technology licensor, Vactech, and its collaborators (DIPP Study), identified CVB infection as a likely environmental trigger in the onset of T1D autoimmunity and T1D-associated celiac disease (CD) autoimmunity. Subsequent full-virome analysis of the TEDDY Study (400,000 children international study) confirmed that CVB is the only virus whose persistent infection is associated with the development of T1D and celiac disease autoimmunity (T1D-associated and also independent of T1D).
 
CVB infection is very common and is responsible for various symptoms and complications ranging from mild respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disturbances and hand-foot-mouth disease to life-threatening cardiomyopathy and meningitis. However, in patients with a certain genetic background, CVB appears responsible for the development of autoimmunity. The T1D association with CVB infection has been observed in independent cohorts in 15 countries, including in North America, Europe and Australasia. These epidemiological observations have been substantiated by biological experimentation. Insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas express specialized receptors associated with the transport, storage and release of insulin. These receptors appear to be used by CVB to preferentially infect these cells and polymorphism in these receptors are associated with development of T1D autoimmunity. Infection by enteroviruses can be detected in the pancreatic beta cells of approximately 60% of type-1 diabetes patients and in the gut of most patients with T1D-associated CD. Importantly, if mothers have anti-CVB immunity at the time of the pregnancy, a 50% reduction in the onset of T1D autoimmunity (T1D-associated auto-antibodies) has been observed in their offspring, presumably due to protection by maternal antibodies passed on to the fetus. This observation strongly suggests the potential efficacy of CVB vaccination for children and/or mothers, resulting in the development of protective antibodies potentially capable of preventing or delaying the onset of T1D.
 
An analysis of stool samples collected from these individuals identified enterovirus infections prior to the first detection of T1D auto-antibodies. Enterovirus RNA was also detected in stool samples. Examination of antibodies present in DIPP children who developed at least two islet cell auto-antibodies (sign of incipient T1D) and/or progressed to T1D confirmed that among all enteroviruses, only CVB was significantly associated with initiation of beta cell autoimmunity.

Proposed First in Human Phase 1 Clinical Trial of PRV-101
 
PRV-101 is expected to be a polyvalent (more than one strain) prophylactic CVB vaccine intended to prevent acute CVB infection and the development of CVB-induced T1D and celiac autoimmunity. We believe that, if successful, PRV-101 may prevent up to 50% of T1D cases and up to 20% of celiac cases. The vaccine is currently in a Clinical Trial Application (CTA)-enabling stage, requiring manufacturing and nonclinical studies prior to initiation of the FIH study. Animal safety and efficacy modeling studies completed to date by Vactech demonstrate that CVB triggers diabetes in two animal models of T1D and that vaccination against CVB protects mice from acute infection as well as prevents the onset of diabetes triggered by CVB infection.
 
We plan to commence a FIH Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half 2020 in healthy adult volunteers, with top-line data available in 2021. The primary objective of this FIH clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of PRV-101 administered at two different dose levels in adult healthy volunteers. A secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity (ability to elicit antibodies to CVB) of PRV-101.
 
Preclinical Data for PRV-101
 
The mechanism of action and efficacy of PRV-101 is supported by the results of several in vivo studies. Inactivated CVB-based viral vaccines efficiently protect mice from CVB infections and from viral spread to the pancreas, as seen for CVB1 and CVB3 vaccines. Similar experiments conducted with a vaccine covering all six CVB serotypes demonstrated that it can induce a strong neutralizing anti-CVB response in mice and protect the animals against multiple CVB infections from the corresponding live viruses. Independent experiments confirm that CVB infection can accelerate T1D onset in T1D susceptible NOD (Non-obese diabetic) or SOCS-1-Tg (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 transgenic) mice, suggesting that protection from CVB infection would therefore protect against T1D development. This hypothesis has been recently confirmed in experiments conducted by the Karolinska Institute (Sweden) and the University of Tampere (Finland), demonstrating that a CVB1 vaccine indeed protected SOCS-1-Tg mice against T1D induced by CVB1. These mice develop T1D after CVB1 infection as a consequence of a direct infection of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and the subsequent immune response against the beta cells, mimicking human T1D. A three-injection vaccination course induced robust neutralizing antibody responses against CVB1 and protected mice from both CVB1 infection and CVB1-driven T1D. CVB1 infection led to a loss of insulin-producing cells in unvaccinated mice, which also was prevented by the vaccine. These data strongly support the development of PRV-101 for the prevention of T1D.

Formalin-Inactivated CVB1 Vaccine is effective against CVB1-Induced T1D in a Mouse Model.
 
As seen in the left panel below, CVB1 infection led to loss of insulin-producing cells, and this pathology was completely prevented by the CVB1 vaccine (right panel). In this experiment, while 50% of unvaccinated mice develop T1D as a consequence of CVB1 infection, all vaccinated mice were protected (not shown).
 

Important from a safety point of view, the formalin-inactivated CVB1 vaccines did not cause any undesirable effects in the pancreas. There was no vaccine-induced pancreatic pathological change, islet autoimmunity or diabetes in the vaccinated mice.
 
Finally, maternal CVB infection during gestation in mice protects the offspring from CVB infection and subsequent T1D development, presumably through transfer of specific antibodies from the mother to the fetus, corroborating previous findings in humans in the DIPP study and further supporting the use of a prophylactic vaccine to protect against CVB-associated-T1D.
 
CTA-Enabling Program to Support FIH Study
 
The planned CVB vaccine toxicology program will consist of Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and non-GLP safety and immunogenicity studies conducted in mice. These studies are designed to identify and characterize potential toxicities associated with PRV-101 treatment, including those arising from the immune responses induced by the product. They will mirror the administration regimen that will be used in the proposed FIH study by same route of administration.
 
Pharmacology studies will be conducted to determine the exact composition of the vaccine. It is currently considered that such CVB vaccine should ideally be a polyvalent vaccine (encompassing several CVB serotypes). After completion of these studies, we plan to undertake GMP manufacturing of the final vaccine for clinical trials.
 
CVB Infection Market
 
Enteroviruses are responsible for an estimated ten to 15 million symptomatic infections in the U.S. annually. CVB contributes to a major part of the healthcare costs of enteroviruses as they cause the most serious complications and are among the most frequently reported enteroviral infections according to the CDC. Acute CVB infection is usually asymptomatic or causes common cold-type symptoms. It often leads also to a febrile illness associated by rash, hand-foot-mouth disease and/or mild GI distress. However, CVB infections cause also more severe manifestations including pericarditis, myocarditis, meningitis and pancreatitis.

- | Myocarditis: CVB is the most common etiologic agents for myocarditis in the Western world, responsible for up to 33% of cases of myocarditis. Myocarditis is an important cause of sudden unexpected death: the prevalence of myocarditis in children and adolescents leading to sudden unexpected death has been reported to be as high as 8% to 42%. In certain individuals, acute myocarditis progresses to chronic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a severe life-threatening condition.

- | Otitis media: otitis media (middle ear inflammation) may develop in patients with upper respiratory disease caused by enterovirus. Otitis media constitutes 18% of physician visits in the U.S. (largest single reason in children). The costs of otitis media treatment in the U.S. were estimated to be approximately $3 billion in 2014.

- | Meningitis: CVB is a common cause of enteroviral meningitis. Meningitis beyond the neonatal period is characterized by the sudden onset of fever of 38-40°C. Headache and photophobia are almost universally reported in these patients. Reports on the incidence of viral meningitis vary from approximately 50,000 hospitalized cases to over 2 million cases of aseptic meningitis per year. Based on 300,000 annual cases of aseptic meningitis in the United States (of which enteroviruses, and coxsackie viruses in particular, are the most common cause), the economic impact is estimated to be $1.5 billion in direct costs alone. 

PRV-3279 (Humanized CD32B x CD79B Dual Affinity Biologic for SLE and Other Autoimmune Diseases)
 
Overview
 
SLE is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect nearly every major organ system, causing inflammation, tissue injury, organ damage, and in some patients, organ failure. The prognosis of SLE is highly variable in individual patients, often waxing and waning throughout their lifetime. The natural history of SLE ranges from relatively benign disease to rapidly progressive and even fatal disease. Comorbidities, such as infections, malignancies, hypertension, lipid disorders and diabetes increase the risk of disability and death in patients with SLE. Organ systems commonly affected by SLE include the central nervous system, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, mucous membranes, heart, skin, hematologic system, musculoskeletal system and lungs, with specific organ involvement defining subsets of the disease (e.g., lupus nephritis). According to the Lupus Foundation of America, at least 1.5 million Americans are afflicted by SLE and more than 16,000 new cases of lupus are reported annually. It is estimated that five million people throughout the world suffer from some form of lupus. Lupus affects primarily women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years). However, men, children, and teenagers can also develop lupus.
 
The pathogenesis of SLE is characterized by an abnormal overactivation of B cells and subsequent pathologic production of auto-antibodies (antibodies that attack one’s own cells and tissues). Uncontrolled activation of B cells is normally terminated when the activating stimulus is exhausted and when a negative feedback loop is triggered by the engagement of an inhibitory Fc receptor, or FcR, known as FcgammaRIIb, or CD32B. Mutations in the CD32B gene in humans are associated with an increased likelihood of SLE, and reduced expression of CD32B is apparent in B cells from SLE patients. It is thought that activation of this inhibitory pathway could ameliorate the overactive B cell-driven pathology of SLE and other autoimmune diseases. In addition, the excess auto-antibodies produced bind to target antigens and form immune complexes.
 
When the B cell receptor, or BCR, (which is the “Y” shaped molecule, resembling an antibody in the figure below) is bound and activated by an antigen, it initiates a cascade of biochemical changes necessary for the activation of the CD32B inhibitory pathway, thus triggering the negative feedback loop. CD79B is a subunit of the BCR that plays a key role in this process when it is close to CD32B. Therefore, if a pharmacologic treatment is to activate the CD32B inhibitory pathway, it also has to simultaneously bind to CD79B. PRV-3279 (formerly MGD010), is a humanized CD32B x CD79B DART protein developed originally by MacroGenics as a bi-specific therapy with these properties, and thus a potential treatment for SLE and other similar diseases. It is designed to simultaneously bind to CD32B and CD79B on B cells.
 


23
--


PRV-3279 and related molecules have shown inhibitory effects on BCR-induced B cell proliferation and antibody secretion (including B cells obtained from SLE patients) as well as beneficial effects in mouse models of autoimmunity. PRV-3279 is expected to boost the negative feedback loop on B cells by robustly engaging the available CD32B and CD79B.
 
PRV-3279 has been studied in humans and was shown to be well tolerated. Proof of mechanism and PRV-3279’s inhibitory effect on antibody immune responses were demonstrated in a Phase 1a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, including a cohort demonstrating inhibition of the immunogenicity of the hepatitis A vaccine. Immunogenicity of PRV-3279 was also observed, but had no impact on mechanistic effects, safety or pharmacokinetics, and decreased with increasing doses of PRV-3279, possibly a reflection of its mechanism of action.
 
We are developing PRV-3279 for the treatment of SLE in the PREVAIL (PRV-3279 EVAluation In Lupus) study. PREVAIL is a multiple ascending dose Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in two parts: Part 1 was a recently completed Phase 1b clinical trial in 16 healthy volunteers, and Part 2 will be a Phase 2a clinical trial in SLE patients. Part 2 will have a treatment duration of at least 12 weeks and will evaluate clinical and biomarker endpoints.
 
Our ultimate goal is to determine if PRV-3279 can intercept the pathophysiology of SLE by preventing the production of auto-antibodies by abnormally active B cells.
 
Current Treatment Options for SLE and Their Limitations
 
The treatment and management of SLE depends on disease severity and disease manifestations. Hydroxychloroquine plays a central role in the long-term treatment of SLE and is the cornerstone of SLE therapy. Corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and immunosuppressive agents (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil) have also been used in the treatment and management of SLE. These treatments are only modestly effective and present safety and/or immune suppression concerns with prolonged use. The B cell-depleting antibody rituximab (Rituxan), while not approved for treatment of SLE, appears to be beneficial in certain subsets of patients.
 
In 2011, the FDA approved belimumab (Benlysta), an antibody that targets B lymphocyte stimulator, for the treatment of mild to moderate SLE in combination with standard therapy, providing additional clinical validation of the therapeutic benefit of B cell-targeted therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the modest therapeutic benefit of belimumab and delayed onset of disease intervention indicate the need for additional therapeutic strategies to inhibit overactive B cells. We believe PRV-3279 can fulfill that requirement and is uniquely differentiated to allow for rapid inhibition of activated B cells (potentially more effective than belimumab), while sparing non-activated B cells from depletion or inactivation (potentially safer than rituximab).

Overview of CD32B Biology
 
CD32B is expressed widely on the surface of human B cells. In addition to its expression on B cells, CD32B is also expressed on other immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells. It is a single-chain protein with a portion that sits outside of the cell membrane, which can be bound by chemical signals.
 
CD32B is the only known inhibitory FcR in the immune system. It plays an important role not only for innate and adaptive immune responses, but also in the maintenance of immune tolerance and controlling autoimmunity. Mice deficient in CD32B have increased antibody responses due in part to chronic B cell activation, and as a result, develop autoimmune disease similar to human SLE. In contrast, B cell-specific overexpression of CD32B reduces the incidence and severity of lupus in a mouse lupus model. In humans, mutations and decreased expression of the CD32B gene are associated with an increased likelihood of SLE. These results underscore the important role of CD32B in regulating the antibody immune response and suggest that drug-mediated engagement of CD32B could provide therapeutic benefit in autoimmune diseases by dampening the effects of chronically activated B cells and reducing the production of auto-antibodies. In particular, preventing the production of auto-antibodies could intercept the disease course in lupus nephritis, a subtype of lupus driven by accumulation of auto-antibodies and immune complexes (a mass of antibodies and other molecules) in the kidneys.
 
Mechanism of Action of PRV-3279
 
PRV-3279 is in a new class of bispecific scaffold antibody-like molecules called DARTs. It is designed to simultaneously bind to CD32B and CD79B on B cells. The simultaneous binding of both CD32B and CD79B triggers CD32B-coupled immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif signaling, which leads to the suppression of B cells activated to produce auto-antibodies, while not causing broad B cell depletion.
 
To prolong its half-life in the body, PRV-3279 contains a human IgG1 Fc region (a specific antibody fragment) that is manipulated to eliminate its effector function. As a molecule designed to inhibit immune responses, PRV-3279 does not activate any part of the immune system either in the body or in laboratory tests. PRV-3279 also does not bind to platelets, a unique feature compared to competing molecules targeting CD32B that are associated with toxicity due to binding to platelets.
 
Multiple Ascending Dose Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of PRV-3279 in Healthy Volunteers and Patients with Lupus
 
We are conducting a two-part study in SLE, the PREVAIL (PRV-3279 EVAluation In Lupus) study. PREVAIL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of multiple ascending doses of PRV-3279 in 16 healthy adult volunteers (Part 1) and the efficacy of PRV-3279 in patients with lupus (Part 2).
 
On March 12, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the Phase 1b portion of the PREVAIL study. PRV-3279 was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events, and as expected, did not deplete B cells and demonstrated profound and sustained binding to circulating B lymphocytes, with reduction of circulating immunoglobulin M levels in a dose-proportional manner. While anti-drug antibody production was observed at both dose levels tested, immunogenicity was found not to affect exposure, safety or pharmacodynamic parameters.
 
Based on these results, we plan to commence the Phase 2a portion of the PREVAIL study in lupus patients in the first half of 2021.
 
Our ultimate goal is to determine if PRV-3279 can intercept the pathophysiology of SLE by preventing the production of auto-antibodies by abnormally active B cells. Part 2 will have a treatment duration of at least 12 weeks and endpoints will include lupus clinical assessments and biomarker measurements. Clinical endpoints will include the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group score, urine protein to creatinine ratio, and daily glucocorticoid use. Additional biomarkers will include urinary/renal markers (e.g., serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate) and blood/circulating markers (e.g., auto-antibodies, complement (C3 and C4), B cell function/phenotype, including CD32B expression/response relationship).

Preclinical Evaluation of PRV-3279
 
The only nonhuman species that PRV-3279 binds to is chimpanzees. An initial non-GLP study with PRV-3279 in chimpanzees demonstrated it to be well tolerated at all doses, with an assigned no observed-adverse-effect level, or NOAEL, of 10 mg/kg.
 
Due to the lack of target binding, chronic four-week and three-month repeat-dose GLP toxicology studies were performed using a surrogate DART molecule similar to PRV-3279 that was designed to target human CD32B and mouse CD79B in a transgenic mouse line that expresses human CD32B. A NOAEL at the highest dose of 50 mg/kg was assigned in the three-month study. These studies support the advancement of PRV-3279 in long-term efficacy studies in humans (up to three months).
 
Clinical Evaluation and Proof of Mechanism for PRV-3279
 
To date, there have been two clinical trials completed with PRV-3279. The first study was conducted at a single site in the U.S., from February 2015 to February 2017 and was a first in human, or FIH, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1a clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of PRV-3279 in healthy adult volunteers.
 
A total of 49 subjects were randomized; 12 received placebo and 37 received PRV-3279 intravenously at escalating doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in six cohorts. PRV-3279 was well tolerated over the range of doses, with only mild adverse events that resolved quickly, including headache, somnolence (sleepiness), upper respiratory tract infection, folliculitis and night sweats. Target binding and proof of mechanism were demonstrated by measuring functional B cell inhibition at doses of 1 mg/kg or higher, without broader B cell activation or depletion observed.
 
Subsequently, proof of mechanism was further confirmed in a dose escalation extension of the study in which single doses of PRV-3279 at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (16 subjects) were compared with placebo (eight subjects) for the ability to affect B cell responses to a hepatitis A vaccine, which was administered to participants who had no previous hepatitis A immunity, on day two of the study. At both doses, PRV-3279 reduced the proportion of volunteers who generated an immune response against the vaccine, as well as the amount of antibody they produced, in both cases as compared to placebo.
 
The second study was the Phase 1b portion of the PREVAIL study, which was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in 16 health volunteers.
 
On March 12, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the Phase 1b portion of the PREVAIL study. PRV-3279 was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events, and as expected, did not deplete B cells and demonstrated profound and sustained binding to circulating B lymphocytes, with reduction of circulating immunoglobulin M levels in a dose-proportional manner. While anti-drug antibody production was observed at both dose levels tested, immunogenicity was found not to affect exposure, safety or pharmacodynamic parameters.
 
Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity of PRV-3279
 
PRV-3279 exhibited an approximate half-life of seven days after a single dose. A majority (~86%) of study participants developed antibodies against PRV-3279 (i.e., immunogenicity) after receiving the 3 mg/kg dose, but no detrimental effect was observed on the pharmacokinetics of PRV-3279. The proportion of participants developing antibodies against PRV-3279 decreased with increasing dose (29% in the 10 mg/kg dose) and such antibodies did not occur in the multiple dose chimpanzee study, suggesting that PRV-3279 may limit its own immunogenicity at therapeutic doses, which is consistent with its mechanism of action.
 
SLE Market and Other Opportunities for PRV-3279
 
Sales of therapies to treat SLE are expected to climb to nearly $2 billion in 2019, approximately 17% annual growth from 2009. This growth is driven primarily by the entry and uptake of novel treatments that target B cells such as belimumab, the possible approval of new mechanisms (e.g. Type I interferon inhibitors) and off-label use of rituximab. The uptake of belimumab has been driven largely by safety rather than substantial efficacy, supporting the unmet need and potential for novel and safe non-depleting B cell therapies with greater efficacy.

In addition to SLE, PRV-3279 has the potential to treat other B cell- and auto-antibody-driven autoimmune diseases. Such diseases include multiple sclerosis and RA, where B cell therapies rituximab and recently approved ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) have sales in excess of $1 billion. Several niche/orphan indications may also be explored, including T1D (potentially in combination with PRV-031), Sjogren’s syndrome, vasculitis (e.g., polymyalgia rheumatica, giant cell arteritis, Behçets disease), myasthenia gravis, pemphigus, neuromyelitis optica, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Grave’s ophthalmopathy, IgG4-related disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
 
Finally, PRV-3279 also has the potential to prevent or reduce the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, including but not limited to gene therapy vectors and transgenes (new proteins expressed as a result of the gene therapy). Provention Bio intends to explore collaborations with leaders in gene therapy and other biotherapeutic modalities.
 
PRV-015 (human anti-interleukin 15 mAb) for NRCD
 
Overview
 
Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disease triggered by gluten consumption in genetically susceptible individuals. Approximately 1% of the European and North American population is affected by celiac disease. Gluten is ubiquitous in food and elicits autoimmune responses in celiac patients, with damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine. Celiac disease causes debilitating symptoms and serious medical complications, as the small bowel damage can lead to nutrient malabsorption and results in a range of subsequent intestinal and extra-intestinal clinical manifestations. The stimulation of intestinal lymphocytes for decades can lead to the development of lymphoma, with increased mortality.
 
The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 15 (IL-15) has been identified as a major mediator in the pathophysiology of celiac disease. PRV-015, a fully human mAb, binds to and inhibits IL-15 and has emerged as a leading candidate for the treatment of nonresponsive celiac disease, in which patients continue to have disease activity despite ongoing gluten free diet, or GFD. PRV-015 was initially developed by Genmab A/S as HuMax-IL15, and by Amgen and Celimmune LLC as AMG 714. PRV-015 has undergone clinical testing in approximately 250 subjects who have received PRV-015 across two Phase 1 (healthy volunteers and psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, or RA) and three Phase 2 clinical trials (celiac disease, RCD-II, RA). No serious adverse events deemed related to PRV-015 were observed that would preclude further clinical development. Proof of Mechanism and/or proof of concept was demonstrated in RA, celiac disease and refractory celiac disease Type II. The effect of PRV-015 in celiac disease was evidenced by reduction in inflammation and symptoms after a controlled gluten challenge in a Phase 2a clinical trials with 63 celiac patients. We plan to initiate a 220-patient Phase 2b clinical trial in NCRD, in 2020, after completion of chronic toxicology studies.
 
Celiac Disease Background Information
 
Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disease triggered by gluten consumption in genetically susceptible individuals. Approximately 1% of the western population is affected by celiac disease. This prevalence has been reported to be doubling every 20 years. Gluten, the antigen responsible for celiac disease, is the main protein present in some of the most common cereals (wheat, barley, rye). Modern diets are increasingly enriched with gluten and it is also used as an additive in processed foods, cosmetics and oral medications. Gluten is also present in trace amounts in foods labeled as “gluten-free”, as a tableting excipient, and in products such as toothpaste and lipstick. As little as 50mg/day of gluten triggers the disease. A normal diet contains >10 g/day, 200 times the amount that causes damage and intestinal histological abnormalities. As such, celiac patients face enormous challenges to follow a strict GFD.
 
The pathophysiology of celiac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune response to gluten. Humans lack enzymes to fully digest gluten, which against the right genetic background triggers inflammation and autoimmunity in the intestine and in other organs. An adaptive immune response is triggered when gluten peptides are deamidated in the extracellular space, by the enzyme tissue transglutaminase, normally an intracellular enzyme that is released by damaged cells. This deamidation renders gluten peptides high-avidity binders to HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, which present these peptides to intestinal CD4+ T cells, thereby activating these T cells and initiating the inflammatory cascade. The innate immune system’s intraepithelial lymphocytes, or IELs, primarily CD8+, are able to directly lyse and destroy intestinal epithelial cells, damaging the mucosal lining of the small intestine, in response to IL-15 release stimulated by gluten peptides. In healthy individuals, the activated T cells are controlled by Tregs, but this does not happen in celiac disease as IL-15 confers the effector CD4+ T cells resistance to suppression by Tregs.
 

27

Celiac disease causes debilitating symptoms and serious medical complications. In many patients, gastrointestinal symptoms derived from intestinal mucosal damage dominate the patient reported symptoms at diagnosis. The normal villi (absorptive finger-like prolongations) present in the gut of healthy individuals are lost in active celiac disease as a result of mucosal atrophy and crypt enlargement. Small bowel damage often leads to nutrient malabsorption that can result in a range of further clinical manifestations (anemia, osteopenia, failure to thrive in children). In addition, extra-intestinal symptoms and systemic manifestations are often present, such as dermatitis, infertility, or neurological and skeletal disorders. Mortality is increased in subjects with persistent intestinal mucosal damage.
 
The most serious complication of celiac disease is the development of an in situ small bowel T cell lymphoma after many years of exposure, voluntary or inadvertent, to gluten. This malignant complication of celiac disease, which appears to be independent of gluten and unresponsive to a strict GFD, is termed RCD-II when the percentage of aberrant IELs is >20% and Type I refractory celiac disease when the percentage is <20%. In RCD-II, aberrant IELs proliferate in what represents a slow-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma localized (in situ) in the small bowel, primarily in the epithelial compartment. RCD-II affects approximately 0.5% of celiac patients and can lead to overt and systemic enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma, with very poor prognosis and >80% mortality in five years.
 
Current Treatment Options and Their Limitations
 
Celiac disease is the only common autoimmune disorder with no approved medication. The only current available strategy for the management of celiac disease is a lifelong total avoidance of gluten. While simple in theory, the ubiquity of gluten in foodstuffs, medications, household substances, cosmetics, and gluten-free items makes total avoidance of gluten difficult, if not impossible.
 
The main challenge to the successful maintenance of a GFD is that cereal flours are widely used in the food industry and are present in numerous food products either naturally or as additives. Although gluten-free products can be purchased, commercially manufactured gluten-free products may be difficult to find, tend to be less flavorful and are more expensive than regular gluten containing foods. In addition, labeling of food products is deficient in many countries. Even in countries with superior labeling guidelines foods labeled “gluten-free” may nevertheless contain gluten. For example, in northern European countries amounts of up to 100 parts per million are permitted in gluten-free products designated apt for celiac sufferers.
 
For these reasons, celiac sufferers are regularly exposed to gluten contamination in the food and beverages they consume. This exposure to gluten contamination and the associated physiological and psychological consequences results in a self-limitation of social activities and/or a reduction in the variety of foods consumed. Thus, the only currently available management option of a GFD presents both a considerable challenge and substantial burden for patients. A study by Shah and collaborators (2014) found the burden of celiac disease and GFD on patient quality of life to be very high, second only to end-stage renal disease – a condition that requires multiple, weekly dialysis treatments.
 
As a result of the difficulty in maintaining total avoidance of gluten while on a GFD, gluten contamination causes 50% or more of all diagnosed celiac patients on a GFD to continue to experience disease activity. Patients who continue to have symptoms despite attempting to maintain a GFD are deemed to have NRCD. NRCD has been defined as “persistent symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities typical of celiac disease despite 6–12 months of dietary gluten avoidance”. As requested by patient support groups and experts, alternative treatment options that can be administered independently or in combination with a GFD, as well as treatments for refractory celiac disease, are required in order to improve the quality of life for celiac patients.
 
Overview of IL-15 Biology and PRV-015 Mechanism of Action
 
IL-15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that serves as a potent growth, survival, and activation factor for T cells, particularly IELs, and for natural killer, or NK, cells. Increased expression of IL-15 has been demonstrated in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including celiac disease, RA, and psoriasis. IL-15 is considered a central regulator of celiac disease immunopathology and a non-redundant driver of lymphomagenesis in RCD-II.

Substantial evidence suggests a pathophysiological role for IL-15 in celiac disease:
 
Innate immunity:
 

● | IL-15 is an essential, non-redundant growth and activation factor for the IELs which destroy the intestinal mucosa; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The expression of IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium is necessary for villous atrophy; and 
● | In some patients, IL-15 drives progression towards lymphomagenesis and potentially fatal RCD-II. 

 
Adaptive immunity:
 

● | IL-15 enhances the presentation of deamidated gluten peptides by APCs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | IL-15 renders the activated CD4+ T cells resistant to inhibition by Tregs; and 
● | IL-15 has been proven to be a key factor in the loss of tolerance to food antigens.

 
By activating the IELs, IL-15 is believed to be the main mediator in the mucosal damage that ensues in response to gluten exposure in celiac disease. The expression of IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium is necessary for villous atrophy in animal models of celiac disease and circumstantial evidence suggests this to be the case in humans, as well. In addition, IL-15 renders effector T cells resistant to inhibition by Tregs, promoting loss of tolerance to food antigens.
 
One of the studied mouse models of celiac disease is an IL-15-transgenic mouse, in which IL-15 overexpression by gut epithelial cells leads to celiac-like disease, including T and B cell-mediated pathology. IEL apoptosis has been observed in this animal model after treatment with anti-IL-15 or anti-IL-15-receptor monoclonal antibodies.
 
Figure 1. Multiple actions of IL-15 in the pathophysiology of celiac and refractory celiac disease
 

PRV-015 (formerly AMG 714 and HuMax-IL15), is a fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1κ) mAb which binds to and inhibits the function of IL-15 in all its forms (cis, trans, soluble IL-15 bound to IL-15Rα). PRV-015 inhibits IL-15-induced T cell proliferation and shows a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-15-induced TNF-α production. PRV-015 underwent preclinical testing and was subsequently evaluated in a Phase 1 and Phase 2 study in subjects with RA, in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and in patients with psoriasis, and in two Phase 2a studies in celiac disease and refractory celiac disease Type-II.

Phase 2b Clinical Trial of PRV-015 in Celiac Disease (PROACTIVE Study)
 
We and our partner Amgen conducted chronic toxicology studies in 2019 which will continue into the first half of 2020 and intend to conduct a Phase 2b clinical trial (the PROACTIVE study) in approximately 220 patients with gluten-free diet NRCD. We expect to commence the Phase 2b PROACTIVE study in the second quarter of 2020. Based on feedback from regulators, we do not expect that we will need to conduct any pediatric PK clinical studies.
 
The PROACTIVE study (PROvention Amgen Celiac ProtecTIVE Study) will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients with NRCD. PRV-015 will be administered every two weeks via subcutaneous route. The hypothesis of this study is that PRV-015 will be superior to the GFD at intercepting the effects of contaminating gluten exposure in celiac patients following a GFD, as measured by symptoms and objective signs of intestinal inflammation after 24 weeks of treatment. Approximately 220 subjects are planned to be enrolled. We expect to report top line results for the Phase 2b PROACTIVE study in 2022.
 
Pre-clinical Evaluation of PRV-015
 
The nonclinical development of PRV-015 consisted of a series of in vitro studies demonstrating the binding properties of PRV-015 against human IL-15; in vitro and in vivo studies providing proof-of-concept for the benefit of blocking the IL-15 pathway in celiac disease; and a series of GLP studies evaluating the nonclinical safety profile of Hu714MuXHu, the PRV-015 surrogate molecule which is active in macaques.
Pharmacology
 
PRV-015 was found to be efficacious in a mouse model of celiac disease triggered by the transgenic expression of human IL-15 in the gut epithelium. In this model, PRV-015 prevented IEL activation and proliferation, as well as histological abnormalities. In addition, PRV-015 was able to induce apoptosis of human IELs in ex vivo culture of small intestinal explants from active celiac disease and RCD-II patients. In this culture experiment, PRV-015 resulted in a suppression of IL-15-driven anti-apoptotic signaling via JAK3 and STAT5.
Toxicology
 
In vitro studies demonstrated that PRV-015 had high binding affinity for human IL-15, but lower affinity for macaque IL-15. Additionally, PRV-015 neutralized human IL-15 but did not efficiently neutralize macaque IL-15. To enable preclinical and toxicology studies in macaques, a surrogate antibody, Hu714MuXHu, was developed by Amgen by fusing the F(ab) portion of a mouse anti-human IL-15 mAb known to neutralize macaque IL-15, M111, with human IgG1 Fc. Hu714MuXHu was shown to neutralize macaque IL-15 with approximately the same potency as PRV-015 neutralizes human IL-15.
 
There was a decrease in NK cell counts and NK cell activity following administration of Hu714MuXHu to monkeys, reflecting a PD response to IL-15 blockade in this species, given the known role of IL-15 in NK cell biology in animal models (rodents and non-human primates). Of note, no changes in absolute or relative numbers of NK cells were observed in any of the human studies. This difference between observations in preclinical studies and clinical trials appears related to a differential sensitivity of human versus cynomolgus monkey NK cells to IL-15 deprivation. Human NK cells are not dependent on IL-15 for their survival, possibly due to the redundant role of IL-2 on human NK cells.
 
Pharmacokinetics of PRV-015
 
The PK of PRV-015 was consistent with a typical human immunoglobulin G1 antibody with no apparent target-mediated disposition within the investigated dosing range. The mean half-life in human studies has been 20 to 22 days, potentially enabling monthly dosing.
 
There was no development of anti-drug antibodies to PRV-015 in healthy volunteers, patients with psoriasis or patients with refractory celiac disease. Only one RA patient in the phase 2b study was positive for ADA. Approximately 14% of patients with celiac disease developed ADA in the Phase 2a clinical trial, with an additional 10% presenting pre-existing ADA, a reflection of the abnormal antibody responses which characterize celiac disease. The ADA were not associated with injection reactions or adverse events, and they were non-neutralizing, with no impact on PK.

Clinical Proof of Mechanism for PRV-015
 
Although PRV-015 missed the primary endpoint, approximately 60% of patients in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies versus a response of approximately 30% of patients in the placebo groups demonstrated a response to treatment. PRV-015 also led to decreases in inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. PRV-015 was not effective in psoriasis, suggesting PRV-015’s action is selective, unlike that of broad systemic immune suppressants.
 
Upon gluten challenge in a Phase 2 clinical trial in celiac disease, PRV-015 did not prevent gluten-induced architectural mucosal injury, and thus missed the primary endpoint, yet the high dose of PRV-015, 300 mg, showed statistically significant attenuation of gluten’s effects on the change from baseline in intestinal inflammation, in patient-reported symptom questionnaires (the Celiac Disease Patient Reported Endpoint, CeD PRO, a registrational endpoint in NRCD) and in diarrhea, compared with placebo. The totality of the results from the patients who had gluten challenge indicate that 300 mg AMG 714 given every two weeks can ameliorate the inflammation and symptoms caused by substantial gluten exposure, the first demonstration of such dual benefit in intestinal inflammation and symptoms for any experimental medication for celiac disease. The results suggest that PRV-015 can be a potential adjunctive treatment for NRCD to the GFD to ameliorate or resolve persistent inflammation seen in the majority of celiac patients already on GFD.
 
In the Phase 2a clinical trial in RCD-II, the primary endpoint (reduction in intestinal IELs) was not achieved, yet PRV-015 showed statistically significant benefit over placebo in reducing T cell receptor clonality (no increase in clonality with PRV-015) and symptoms (diarrhea). Other endpoints, such as histology, did not reach statistically significant differences between groups, but the results consistently favored PRV-015 numerically. PRV-015 was well tolerated, with no observed immunogenicity.
 
Summary data of the Phase 2a clinical trial as presented at Digestive Disease Week in June 2018 is shown below:

The CELIM-NRCD-001 study included 62 randomized celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, of which 49 patients underwent a substantial gluten challenge of 2.5 grams per day for 10 weeks in order to assess the ability of PRV-015 to ameliorate the effects of gluten. Upon gluten challenge, PRV-015 did not prevent gluten-induced architectural mucosal changes, the primary endpoint in the study. However, in secondary efficacy assessments, the PRV-015 300 mg dose consistently attenuated the effects of gluten in intestinal inflammation (intraepithelial lymphocyte density, p=0.03), and in gastrointestinal symptoms as measured by three independent endpoints: the Celiac Disease Patient Reported Endpoint (CeD-PRO, p=0.02), the Celiac Disease Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (CeD-GSRS, p=0.07) and the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS/diarrhea, p=0.0002). The CeD-PRO is a validated endpoint acceptable for registrational trials. In addition, patients in the PRV-015 300 mg arm had a significantly improved Physician Global Assessment of disease (PGA, p=0.03). The totality of the results demonstrated proof-of-concept for PRV-015 300 mg given subcutaneously every two weeks in the amelioration of inflammation and symptoms caused by the consumption of gluten by celiac patients. Importantly, PRV-015 was well tolerated, and only 14% of patients developed anti-drug antibodies, which were non-neutralizing and not correlated with impact of efficacy or safety. The PK profile was consistent with a monoclonal antibody, and potentially enables future monthly dosing.

Safety of PRV-015
 
Approximately 250 subjects have been exposed to PRV-015 to date, including approximately 200 subjects for 12 weeks of biweekly dosing. In all studies to date, PRV-015 was generally well tolerated by healthy volunteers, patients with active RA, and patients with celiac disease or RCD-II. While PRV-015 could, theoretically, increase susceptibility to infections as is the case with immune modulators, PRV-015 has not demonstrated this effect in the six clinical trials completed to date. No deaths or clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters were observed, including no NK cell depletion.

--


The only adverse events clearly increased in PRV-015-treated patients have been injection site reactions, which were more commonly reported in subjects exposed to PRV-015, in a dose-dependent fashion (up to ~52% on PRV-015 vs ~26% in placebo in the celiac Phase 2a clinical trial), and nasopharyngitis (most cases with suspected allergic origin at a single site in RCD-II). In the population which will be studied in Phase 2b, celiac disease, there were no SAEs in the Phase 2a clinical trial, while there were six SAEs (five on PRV-015 and one on placebo) in the RCD-II, a much sicker patient population with immune suppression at baseline. Of the five SAE on PRV-015 in RCD-II patients, two were infections (both resolved while on PRV-015). There was one mild balance disorder (considered unlikely to be related to PRV-015 and resolved while on the drug.) Another patient had mild cerebellar syndrome which lead to discontinuation from the study.
 
Celiac Disease Market
 
There is no approved drug for CD. The annual healthcare utilization by NRCD patients in 2013 was $18,206, for $4,796 in matched controls due to the extra costs of uncontrolled CD investigations and treatment of complications. Given the large prevalence (15 to 20 million patients world-wide, 1% of the population in the Western world and 0.5% in Asia), and the unmet need (50% of patients on GFD continue to suffer from disease activity due to contaminating gluten in the diet), NRCD is considered a substantial opportunity for pharmaceutical development of an effective and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment to the GFD.
 
PRV-6527 (Small Molecule CSF-1R Inhibitor) for CD
 
Overview
 
CD, a type of chronic IBD characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal, or GI tract, can affect any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus but is more commonly found towards the end of the small intestine. It can also affect the eyes, skin, and joints. Myeloid cells, which originate in the bone marrow, are specialized immune cells, also called APCs believed to play a central role in CD. CSF-1 binds to its receptor (CSF-1R) on myeloid cells and drives the differentiation and maturation of these cells into inflammatory dendritic cells and macrophages, which then populate the gut and other tissues. In the gut, these differentiated myeloid cells present antigens from intestinal bacteria (the microbiome) to white blood cells and trigger inflammatory processes. Based on pre-clinical and human non-clinical data with an inhibitor of CSF-1R in an animal model of IBD, it is reasonable to hypothesize that an inhibitor of CSF-1R will “intercept” the differentiation of these inflammatory cells, preventing their migration from the bone marrow to the intestinal mucosa (i.e., the gut lining) in CD. It is anticipated that significant clinical benefits, such as preventing the relapse or progression of CD, as well as durable benefit (extended pharmacodynamic effect) may result from targeting the upstream pathologic mechanism, since APCs are the necessary initiators of the abnormal immune response.
 
PRV-6527 (previously known as JNJ-40346527) is a highly potent and selective small-molecule oral inhibitor of CSF-1R. It was developed by Janssen and has undergone clinical testing in 178 subjects to date, across Phase 1 (healthy volunteers; 94 received single dose up to 600 mg or two doses of 450 mg) and two Phase 2 clinical trials (RA 63 patients received 200 mg/day for 12 weeks; and 21 Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or HL), patients received 150 mg/day to 650 mg/day for at least three weeks). No serious adverse events deemed related to PRV-6527 were observed that would preclude further clinical development and proof of mechanism was demonstrated based on inhibition of CSF-1R signaling and myeloid cell counts in blood. While clinical data in the RA study was inconclusive and did not demonstrate efficacy in this disease, PRV-6527 ameliorates Crohn’s-like disease in mouse models, and CSF-1R and its pathway are upregulated in CD.
 
In the first quarter of 2018, we initiated a Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial, referred to as the PRINCE study, in approximately 80 patients with CD to assess a clinical and histologic/tissue (gut mucosa) anti-inflammatory effects after 12 weeks of treatment with PRV-6527. This study evaluated doses and dosing duration that were previously tested by Janssen. We completed enrollment of the Phase 2a PRINCE study in April 2019.
 
In October 2019, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2a clinical trial the PRINCE study. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the change in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score at week 12. While PRV-6527 demonstrated a substantial improvement in this symptom driven score at week 12, it did not differentiate from placebo. This high placebo response was deemed to be possibly related to the standard of care and/or background medication used (~85%) in the study’s predominantly biologic-naïve population. PRV-6527 was associated with improvements in several key secondary objective endpoints in the steroid-free population (75% of study subjects), including mucosal endoscopy (as assessed by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease, SES-CD) and tissue histology (as measured by the Global Histological Activity Score, GHAS). Analysis of exploratory serum and tissue biomarkers showed that patients treated with PRV-6527 had significant reductions in circulatory inflammatory monocytes, as well as macrophages, dendritic cells and the CSF1 gene signature in colonic tissue, providing proof of mechanism in the interception of inflammatory myeloid cells. PRV-6527 was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events.

In February 2019, we entered into a services agreement with Parexel, or the Parexel Services Agreement, pursuant to which we retained Parexel to perform implementation and management services in connection with the PROTECT study of PRV-031. We may terminate the services agreement or any work order for any reason and without cause with 90 days’ written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or, bankruptcy petition by the other party or, if any approval from a regulatory authority is revoked, suspended or expires without renewal. We currently anticipate that aggregate costs relating to all work orders under the Parexel Services Agreement for the PROTECT study will be approximately $42.0 million over the period of the study.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our current patent applications and any future patents and other proprietary rights that we own, or control through licensing, are and will be essential to our business. We believe that these intellectual property rights will affect our ability to compete effectively with others. We also rely and will rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, advisors and other parties. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensor, to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for our/their intellectual property, including those patent applications to which we have secured exclusive rights.
 
We plan to spend considerable resources and focus in the future on obtaining U.S. and foreign patents. We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property. No assurances can be given that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us. We intend to expand our international operations in the future and our patent portfolio, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.

PRV-031 (teplizumab anti-CD3 antibody)
 
Through our agreement with MacroGenics, we have acquired a patent portfolio that includes seven issued patents, including two U.S. patents and five ex-U.S. patents in Australia, Israel, Mexico and Singapore. The issued patents are set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2026 and 2028, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments or extensions available under the law. These issued patents cover use of certain humanized antibodies that bind to CD3 in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including T1D and RA.
 
We have additionally filed one U.S. provisional patent application directed to new use of anti-CD3 antibodies, including teplizumab. If issued, patents claiming priority to this provisional application will expire no earlier than 2040, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments or extensions available under the law.
 
PRV-101 (CVB/T1D)
 
Through our agreement with Vactech, we have a licensed patent portfolio that includes one issued U.S. patent, two pending U.S. patent applications, and 38 patents in various European countries (i.e., one granted European patent validated in 38 European Patent Convention member states). The pending U.S. patent applications and the European country patents disclose use of a CVB vaccine composition in the prevention or treatment of T1D.
 
The patents issued in the U.S. and various European countries generally have terms of 20 years from their respective priority filing dates, subject to available extensions, and are thus set to expire no earlier than 2032, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments or extensions available under the law.

Sales and Marketing 
 
We are a clinical stage company without a history of revenue or marketing experience. Because commercialization is expensive and time consuming, we intend to explore multiple commercialization strategies, including:

● | commercialize teplizumab ourselves in the U.S. while exploring strategic partners for markets outside the U.S.; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | developing drug candidates through the earlier stages of clinical development with the objectives of rapid, cost effective risk reduction and value creation and then establishing strategic partnership for late stage clinical development and subsequent commercialization; 
● | developing a robust pipeline of promising drug candidates at various stages of the development process to establish optionality and regular value inflection opportunities and revenue(s); 
● | strategically entering into co-development partnership(s) to retain potential for commercialization rights on selected drug candidate(s) and market opportunities; and 
● | partnering with industry participants to incorporate our technology into new and existing drugs. 

 
We expect that partnering with pharmaceutical or biotherapeutic companies may accelerate product acceptance into target market areas outside the U.S. and gain the sales and marketing advantages of the partner’s distribution infrastructure. We intend to continue to strengthen our market position and solidify our leadership position in immunotherapy by continuing to improve our technology, broadening our clinical and therapeutic applications, identifying new clinical and therapeutic applications and forming strategic relationships with our licensors.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. Although we rely and intend to continue to rely upon third–party contract manufacturers to produce our products and product candidates, we have recruited personnel and consultants with experience to manage these third–party contract manufacturers. In certain cases, our collaboration partners for each respective program are responsible for providing clinical drug supply or drug product for those program’s clinical trials. In other cases, we have engaged third-party manufacturers to provide services related to process development, non-GMP and GMP manufacturing and other related services.
 
The table below lists the third-party responsible for manufacturing drug supply for each of our programs:
 

Product Candidate | Supplier | Party Responsible for Costs 
----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------
PRV-031 | Existing drug supply – MacroGenics Future drug supply – AGC Biologics | MacroGenics Provention 
PRV-101 | Intravacc | Provention 
PRV-3279 | Existing drug supply – MacroGenics Future drug supply – vendors being evaluated | MacroGenics Provention 
PRV-015 | Amgen | Amgen 

 
We have historically relied upon an existing supply of PRV-031 produced by MacroGenics for use in our clinical trials of PRV-031. This existing supply is insufficient to fully supply the ongoing PROTECT study to completion. In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with AGC Biologics to manufacture PRV-031 for our anticipated clinical trial needs. In order to obtain regulatory approval, the PROTECT study will need to include data from a sufficient number of subjects dosed with the supply of PRV-031 produced by AGC Biologics to demonstrate safety and efficacy. In addition, we will require AGC Biologics to satisfy process validation requirements with regard to PRV-031 and we will be required to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory authorities the comparability of AGC Biologics product to MacroGenics product, in order for PRV-031 to obtain regulatory approval.

Competition
 
We face substantial competition from well-established large pharmaceutical companies, as well as innovative new entrants. Nevertheless, we believe our strategic intent is sufficiently differentiated in that we are focusing on intercepting or potentially preventing the onset and progression of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases by selecting and developing product candidates that are aimed at relevant and predominantly upstream pathophysiological targets.
 
The symptomatic treatment of T1D is a highly competitive market with large incumbents such as Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly providing insulin and blood glucose monitoring products and working on new ways to manage the disease. Our goal is to delay or prevent the onset of T1D and spare patients the need to live with blood glucose monitoring and daily insulin injections and this therapy’s many complications and clinically relevant shortfalls. We believe our enteroviral vaccine approach is unique in that it aims to prevent the onset of T1D prior to the rise of immune cells and auto-antibodies programmed to attack insulin producing beta cells. We are aware of competitive vaccine technologies in development that are attempting to alter the autoimmune cycle once these auto-antibodies have been detected. However, we believe our vaccine approach may intercept the process prior to this cycle being initiated (primary prevention). Other immunomodulation therapies have shown preservation of beta cell function in early phase studies of new-onset T1D including anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), CTLA4-Ig (costimulatory blocker), anti-CD20 (Rituxan) and LFA3-Ig (alefacept). All of these Phase 2 studies were conducted by the academic community or by T1D networks and do not appear to be in active development by industry sponsors. The most recent data were reported with Thymoglobulin which is an approved anti-thymocyte globulin obtained by immunization of rabbits with human thymocytes and is indicated for the treatment of renal transplant acute rejection in conjunction with concomitant immunosuppression and for induction in adult renal transplant recipients. Low dose ATG was administered intravenously for 2 days in early onset T1D (within 100 days of diagnosis). While C-peptide preservation was observed, due to the risk of serum sickness, ATG was administered during a 2-3 day hospitalization and required pre-medication, including intravenous corticosteroids.
 
PRV-015 has the potential to be the first drug ever approved for CD since it is the only medication which has shown simultaneous improvement in symptoms and inflammation to date, and since most clinical-stage products are early in development and have not established proof-of-concept. Competition includes experimental medications in development by Innovate (INN-202/larazotide acetate, Phase 2b study completed in 2014; Phase 3 started in 2019), ImmunogenX (IMGX-003/latiglutenase, Phase 2b study completed in 2016 missed primary endpoint, new phase 2a started in 2019), Zedira/Dr. Falk (ZED1227, phase 2a on-going), Cour (NP-GLI, Phase 1/2 completed in 2019) and PvP Biologics (KumaMax, Phase 1 completed in 2019).
 
The market for lupus is currently led by large pharmaceutical companies commercializing older, off-patent products such as steroids, immunosuppressive agents including azathioprine, cyclosphosphamide, cyclosporine and mycophenolate. In addition, Glaxo SmithKline (GSK) and Roche offer recently approved B cell-targeted agents. GSK received approval for belimumab (Benlysta) in 2011, the first drug approval in lupus in 50 years. Despite modest efficacy and slow onset of effect, belimumab’s annual sales are currently approximately $800 million. Roche’s rituximab (Rituxan), a blockbuster drug, is used off-label in lupus despite not having been approved in SLE. The lupus field is competitive and new experimental drugs are being tested in late stage trials by large pharmaceutical companies and early to mid-stage biotech companies and include: the anti-interferon alpha receptor anifrolumab (Astra Zeneca), which posted a positive Phase 3 trial in late 2019; anti-CD19/CD32B XmAb5871 (Xencor), which has not moved forward after mixed Phase 2a results in 2018; and calcineurin inhibitor voclosporin (Aurinia Pharmaceuticals), also with a positive Phase 3 study in lupus nephritis in late 2019. We expect that PRV-3279 will be differentiated from the competition because of greater and faster-onset efficacy, better safety (PRV-3279 does not deplete B cells and is not expected to be immune-suppressive), and less side effects (since PRV-3279 is a highly specific mAb with likely minimal off-target side effects).

Government Regulation
 
Our business activities, including the manufacturing, research, development and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any new drug developed by us or our collaborators must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, import, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Moreover, government coverage and reimbursement policies will both directly and indirectly impact our ability to successfully commercialize any future approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be impacted by enacted and any applicable future healthcare reform and drug pricing measures. In addition, we are subject to state and federal laws, including, among others, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and transparency laws that restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry.
 
In the United States, drug product candidates intended for human use undergo laboratory and animal testing until adequate proof of safety is established. Clinical trials for new product candidates are then typically conducted in humans in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 trials involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. The emphasis of Phase 1 trials is on testing for safety or adverse events, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the compound for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a compound shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes. Before commencing clinical investigations in humans, we or our collaborators must submit an IND to the FDA.
 
Regulatory authorities, Institutional Review Boards and Data Monitoring Committees may require additional data before allowing clinical trials to commence, continue or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues. We have in the past and may in the future rely on assistance from our third-party collaborators and contract service providers to file our INDs and generally support our development and regulatory activities approval process for our potential products. Clinical testing must also meet requirements for clinical trial registration, institutional review board oversight, informed consent, health information privacy, and GCPs. Additionally, the manufacture of our drug product, must be done in accordance with current GMPs.
 
To establish a new product candidate’s safety and efficacy, the FDA requires companies seeking approval to market a drug product to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data, along with other information, for each indication for which the product will be labeled. The data and information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, which must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies. Generating the required data and information for regulatory approval takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a product candidate under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate. Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA or BLA submitted for FDA approval is given an internal administrative review within 60 days following submission of the NDA or BLA. If deemed sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will “file” the NDA or BLA. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA and BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal goals of eight months from submission for priority review of NDAs or BLAs that cover product candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and 12 months from submission for the standard review of NDAs and BLAs. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, these performance goals may change over time and the review is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the NDA or BLA can be approved. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA can choose to inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with GMPs. The FDA may also audit sites at which clinical trials have been conducted to determine compliance with GCPs and data integrity. The FDA’s review of an NDA or BLA may also involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee, particularly for novel indications. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.

In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy, regulations or statutes governing product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review.
 
Before receiving FDA approval to market a potential product, we or our collaborators must demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that the potential product is safe and effective in the patient population that will be treated. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or BLA or supplement thereto must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless a waiver applies. If regulatory approval of a potential product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is approved. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is generally prohibited. Furthermore, FDA approval may entail ongoing requirements for risk management, including post-marketing, or Phase 4, studies. Even if approval is obtained, a marketed product, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to payment of significant annual fees and continuing review and periodic inspections by the FDA. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including labeling changes, warning letters, costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
Any drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or during clinical trials of our potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates. Further, such unacceptable toxicity or side effects could ultimately prevent a potential product’s approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or limit any labeling claims and market acceptance, even if the product is approved.
 
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
Any trade name that we intend to use for a potential product must be approved by the FDA irrespective of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The FDA conducts a rigorous review of proposed product names and may reject a product name if it believes that the name inappropriately implies medical claims or if it poses the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA will not approve a trade name until the NDA or BLA for a product is approved. If the FDA determines that the trade names of other products that are approved prior to the approval of our potential products may present a risk of confusion with our proposed trade name, the FDA may elect to not approve our proposed trade name. If our trade name is rejected, we will lose the benefit of any brand equity that may already have been developed for this trade name, as well as the benefit of our existing trademark applications for this trade name.
 
We and our collaborators and contract manufacturers also are required to comply with the applicable FDA GMP regulations. GMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the FDA. These facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our potential products and must maintain ongoing compliance for commercial product manufacture. The FDA may conclude that we or our collaborators or contract manufacturers are not in compliance with applicable GMP requirements and other FDA regulatory requirements, which may result in delay or failure to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls and/or imposition of fines or penalties.

If a product is approved, we must also comply with post-marketing requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with advertising and promotion laws enforced by various government agencies, including the FDA’s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, through such laws as the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, healthcare information privacy and security laws, post-marketing safety surveillance, and disclosure of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state regulation including, for example, the implementation of corporate compliance programs.
 
If we elect to distribute our products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.
 
Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities, including the EMA. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Community, centralized registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Community member state. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, marketing authorization will be granted. This foreign regulatory development and approval process involves all of the risks associated with achieving FDA marketing approval in the U.S. as discussed above. In addition, foreign regulations may include applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities.
 
Reimbursement
 
Potential sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, at least in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly managing access and using restrictive measures to contain costs. If a third-party payor decides to provide coverage for an approved drug product, patient access and reimbursement is not certain. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenues and results of operations. Decreases in third-party reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product candidate, if approved, or any future approved products could reduce physician usage of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In the United States, Medicare is a program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians and pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (ASP) of the drugs. Reimbursement levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. We do not know whether our product candidates, if approved, will be eligible for coverage under Medicare Part B, but individual Medicare Part B plans offer coverage subject to various factors such as those described above. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies in setting their own coverage policies.

Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
 
Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 
Segments and Geographic Information
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
