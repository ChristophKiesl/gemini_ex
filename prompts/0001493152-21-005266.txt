In the retail foreign exchange trading space, where individuals speculate on the exchange rate between different currencies, our customers are forex brokerages, prime of prime brokers, prime brokers, and banks. The Company generates revenues by licensing its trading technology infrastructure, including but not limited to the trading platform (desktop, web, mobile), back office, and CRM and banking integration technology.
 
We act as an adviser/strategic consultant and reseller of its proprietary technologies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. The Company expects to generate additional revenue from its crypto-related solutions, such as from the development of custom crypto exchange platform for customers, the sale of the non-exclusive source code of crypto exchange platform to third parties, white-label fees of crypto exchange platforms, and the sale of aggregated cryptocurrency data price feed from various crypto exchanges to OTC brokers. The Company initially plans to develop the technology architecture of the crypto exchange platform for its customers. The initial capital required to produce such technologies comes from our customers as the Company takes on design-build software development projects for customers. The Company develops these projects to meet the design criteria and performance requirements as specified by the customer.
 
There are several steps required to set-up a functional crypto exchange platform. Our customers seek necessary licensing approval and meet registration requirements in their respective jurisdictions. Customers are also responsible for establishing a relationship with the payment processing partner, such as a bank. Subsequently, the Company intends to provide and maintain a payment gateway API, giving users the power to add and withdraw funds. Liquidity is an essential aspect of the success of a cryptocurrency exchange marketplace. The trades at an exchange drive its liquidity, and a robust crypto exchange platform requires seamless trading activity. To manage this liquidity at the customer’s crypto exchange business, the Company will integrate its customer crypto exchange’s liquidity position to other existing exchanges. The Company will provide a modern and robust API interface that connects liquidity and trade volume data between various crypto exchanges.
