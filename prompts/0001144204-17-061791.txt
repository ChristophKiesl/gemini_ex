Item 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. is a biotechnology company engaged in the aquaculture, research and development, manufacture and commercialization of Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH). KLH is an immune-stimulating protein with an extensive history of safe and effective use in immunological applications.
 
Immunotherapies (also known as therapeutic vaccines) are an emerging class of treatments that involve using the body’s own immune system to target and treat disease. Today, multiple companies and institutions are developing drugs that combine disease-targeting agents with KLH. These disease-targeting agents do not evoke a robust immune response by themselves and thus require a carrier molecule like KLH.
 
The versatility of the KLH molecule and its use in multiple drug development pipelines provide numerous commercial opportunities for us. KLH is currently utilized in immunotherapies in clinical or pre-clinical development for Alzheimer’s disease, metastatic breast cancer, type 1 diabetes, dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematous, ovarian cancer and various other cancers and diseases. The successful commercialization of one or more of these drug development pipelines, especially in a major indication, could have a significant impact on the industry’s ability to produce sufficient quantities of KLH. The protein is derived only from the Giant Keyhole Limpet, a scarce ocean mollusk that is native to a limited stretch of Pacific Ocean coastline. Due in part to the inherent limitations of utilizing of wild sources of KLH, we believe that aquaculture production methods, like the methods we practice, will be required to provide scalable, fully traceable supplies of KLH.
 
Based upon our specialized knowledge of aquaculture science and KLH, we have built unique land-based aquaculture, laboratory and production facilities in Port Hueneme, California, and developed production and manufacturing processes to produce medical-grade KLH using Current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Using our proprietary aquaculture technology, we can support the marine mollusk from embryo to protein-producing adult, and we now support multiple generations of limpets grown entirely within our land-based aquaculture facility. Other KLH suppliers do not have this capability and thus are reliant on scarce, wild populations of limpets.
 
We market and sell our KLH products under the brand Stellar KLH. Our customers and partners include multinational biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical research organizations and research centers. We have multiple agreements to license and supply Stellar KLH and other technology in exchange for fees, revenues or royalties. Our customers manage and fund all product development and regulatory submissions for their respective drug products that utilize our KLH protein.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we possess a number of competitive strengths that position us to become the world leader in the sustainable manufacture of GMP grade KLH and KLH-conjugated vaccines, including:

• | Fully permitted, land-based aquaculture facility produces a barrier to market entry. Our proprietary methods, infrastructure and aquaculture facility give us the capability to support the source animal in aquaculture. Due to the time needed to raise the source animal to maturity, and the time needed to build and validate facilities and manufacturing processes, including water discharge permits, we believe that we have a five to seven year lead over any new market entrants attempting to produce KLH in a similar manner. Due to its exceptional size and complexity, KLH has not been reproduced synthetically.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fully traceable, GMP grade product offerings benefit commercialization programs. Using our proprietary production and manufacturing methods, we are able to produce a high quality, GMP grade KLH product that is fully traceable and controlled from native source to finished product, which we believe are important considerations for our pharmaceutical partners as they pursue later-stage trials and commercial introductions subject to more rigorous regulatory standards than early-stage research. Due to the known origin of material and continuity of data, we believe we are able to create a more consistent, high quality, immunogenic product than other KLH proteins in the market. In contrast, commercial supplies of KLH from other sources have historically differed widely in their source, traceability, purity, form and preparation, as well as their immunogenicity (their ability to stimulate an immune response). We believe that we are the only company that offers GMP grade KLH supported by fully traceable manufacturing methods.

• | Multiple supply and collaboration agreements reduce single-customer dependence. We believe that our supply and collaboration agreements with drug developers, which include binding orders, allow us to better manage our working capital as well as build long- term relationships. Our manufacturing and quality experts work closely with our collaboration partners and customers to deliver KLH products according to their specifications. We believe that our long-term relationships and collaborative approach have helped build customer trust and loyalty.

• | Business model leverages growth potential. We believe we have an attractive business model due to the unique nature of our product offerings, embedded growth opportunities within our existing customer base and operating leverage. As we increase production volumes and sales, we expect our operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue, providing for greater operating leverage. In addition, we have established a model via our joint venture, Neostell, S.A.S., to participate in the manufacturing of KLH-conjugated vaccines, which provides additional revenue and growth opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intellectual property portfolio includes protection for specialized systems and technologies. We have intellectual property related to KLH development and manufacturing and to the environmental protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet, including patents, trade secrets and know-how related to specialized aquaculture systems and technologies; spawning, selection and maintenance of the species; non- lethal KLH protein extraction methods; and the processing, purification and production of KLH formulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety profile and extensive citations in scientific literature contribute to the appeal of KLH as a carrier platform for immunotherapies. KLH has been used for decades in immune system testing, it has an extensive safety record, and continues to be selected for new immunotherapies preparing to enter clinical testing. According to a search on PubMed, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, there are more than 3,600 publications referencing Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin in biomedical literature. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustainability practices protect marine source and promote scalability Our KLH protein is produced using environmentally sound, sustainable practices intended to protect and renew the live marine source. We believe this is a critical component of ensuring long-term, scalable supplies, since rapid growth in demand has had severe consequences to other related species. In California, for example, failure to manage wild populations of abalone resulted in dramatic declines and eventually led to closure of commercial abalone harvests.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leadership team provides extensive aquaculture production and related industry expertise. Our leadership team includes industry experts who have extensive experience in the field of aquaculture and Giant Keyhole Limpet production, and possess a deep understanding of a variety of biotechnology businesses. Our President and CEO has more than 40 years of experience leading commercial aquaculture businesses and projects focused on mollusk domestication and production.

Our Strategy
 
We intend to develop and expand the market for KLH and KLH-conjugated vaccines. Our near-term focus is to support the further development of third party drug candidates utilizing Stellar KLH and to expand our customer base. This strategy seeks to preserve the opportunity for Stellar to share in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing our licensed KLH products. In addition to fees, revenues or royalties we may receive, we believe that the successful development of third party drug candidates will further validate our technologies, increase awareness and promote broader adoption of our products by additional third parties. Key elements of our business strategy include:

• | Expand infrastructure and capacity while prudently managing our working capital. We currently have multiple customers with KLH-based drug candidates in Phase 2 studies. While the outcome of these clinical studies cannot be predicted, we are preparing for the possible impact that favorable clinical results could have on the KLH market and the company’s supply capabilities. We plan to incrementally increase our infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities and KLH production capacity based on our customers’ forecasts and the anticipated future requirements of commercial-scale vaccine manufacturing, which we estimate could require multiple kilograms of GMP grade KLH per year. In order to produce such volumes and to provide our customers with greater certainty of future supply, we intend to have the capacity to support commercial drug launches in a variety of indications, with planned redundancy at multiple locations. We also plan to increase efficiency and throughput capacity by optimizing our manufacturing and purification processes. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue additional supply and collaboration agreements. We plan to continue pursuing opportunities for commercial growth that build on our strengths and core competencies in KLH development and manufacturing, including additional supply and collaboration agreements. We regularly engage in discussions with various entities involved in immunotherapies, in connection with opportunities for licensing, supply and collaborative research.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support continuing development of our Neostell Growth Initiative. In July 2016, we formed Neostell S.A.S., a joint venture with Neovacs S.A, to produce Neovacs’ Kinoid immunotherapy product candidates which utilize Stellar KLH as a carrier molecule. In addition to expanding our market opportunities related to manufacturing of Neovacs’ KLH-conjugated vaccines, this joint venture provides the opportunity to manufacture and sell KLH-based immunotherapies for third party customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Continue innovation and new product development. We plan to expand our KLH technology portfolio through ongoing research and development. Our research and development activities are focused primarily on the aquaculture of the Giant Keyhole Limpet; improvements in KLH protein characterization and manufacturing; the development of functional assays; and new uses for KLH in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostic applications. We believe that these activities provide long-term strategic, revenue and clinical opportunities by extending the commercial use of Stellar KLH and furthering our understanding of the KLH molecule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue additional markets for our technology and products. We intend to evaluate additional markets for our current products and technologies. Due to the immune-stimulating characteristics of KLH, we believe the protein could have broader applications in the medical field or other markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH)
 
KLH is a safe, potent, immune-stimulating protein. Specifically, it is a very large, high molecular weight, oxygen-carrying glycoprotein. In addition to the native molecule, KLH can be chemically dissociated into a subunit formulation commonly used in the production of immunotherapies. Both the native, high molecular weight molecule and subunit forms of KLH are excellent immune stimulants. The KLH molecular structure offers numerous sites for conjugation, and can generate multiple product configurations. Because of its large size, immune-stimulating properties, numerous sites for conjugation, and safety profile, KLH is used by researchers and product developers as a vaccine carrier protein. However, due to its exceptional size and complexity, KLH has not been reproduced synthetically.
 
KLH can be used as a carrier molecule, or it can be used as a finished, injectable product in the immunodiagnostic market.
 
As a carrier molecule, KLH is combined, or conjugated, to vaccine antigens that are used to promote the generation of antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against targeted diseases. By themselves, the small haptens (partial antigens) and vaccine antigens used to target these diseases are not usually immunogenic enough to awaken the immune system and therefore, require a carrier molecule or adjuvant, like KLH, in order to be effective. The combination of an antigen against specific pathogenic targets, such as tumors, and over-expressed proteins, conjugated to the immunogenic KLH molecule, is the basis for a promising new class of drugs in development known as active immunotherapies or therapeutic vaccines. Unlike preventative vaccines, active immunotherapies are designed to stimulate the body’s own immune system to generate an immune response to target and attack an existing disease or condition. We believe immunotherapies are, and will continue to be, one of the fastest-growing sectors of pharmaceutical research and development. KLH is an important component for drugs used in clinical development, including major indications such as Alzheimer’s disease, metastatic breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematous, dermatomyositis, ovarian cancer and various other cancers and diseases. New indications expected to enter clinical trials, such as type 1 diabetes, point to expanding clinical potential for KLH.
 
As a finished injectable product, KLH has been used extensively by pharmaceutical companies and researchers as a safe, immune-stimulating antigen in drug-screening, drug immunotoxicology, and assessment of immune status. KLH is a standard immunogen in T-Cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR), a functional assay which is widely recognized as a standard test for monitoring the effects of drugs on the immune system.
 
KLH protein is derived only from the hemolymph of the Giant Keyhole Limpet (Megathura crenulata), a mollusk native only to a limited stretch of the Pacific Ocean coastline along Southern California and Baja California, Mexico. Historically, suppliers other than us have obtained KLH protein directly from wild and sensitive populations of Giant Keyhole Limpet, or have utilized lethal production processes. Based on publicly available information and reports, commercial supplies of KLH differ widely in their source, traceability, purity, form, and preparation, as well as in immunogenicity (their ability to stimulate an immune response). We believe that highly-specialized aquaculture manufacturing methods, like the methods we practice, protect the KLH molecule’s source species and provide sustainable, scalable supplies of quality KLH protein. The concept of sustainability involves sound, responsible management of environmental resources and, especially where biological systems are concerned, includes protecting native species so that the species thrive and remain diverse and productive over time. Further, we believe that environmentally sound methods associated with professional and specialized aquaculture can minimize variability in KLH products and assure full traceability to their biological source.
 
Our Technology
 
We have spent more than 15 years developing and optimizing sustainable KLH production methods, specifically focused on protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet and a patented, non-lethal method to extract KLH protein. We believe our proprietary methods will provide a scalable supply of GMP grade KLH and meet pharmaceutical industry standards for immune response, consistency, purity, and traceability while protecting the natural source species.

Our proprietary aquaculture technology involves methods we developed and optimized to control the reproduction and growth of the Giant Keyhole Limpet including, but not limited to, culture systems, nutritional requirements and the recirculation of seawater. We achieved a significant milestone in aquaculture science by developing the capability to sustain the complete life cycle of the Giant Keyhole Limpet. Using our proprietary methods, we can support the marine mollusk from embryo to protein-producing adult, and we now support multiple generations of limpets grown entirely within our land-based aquaculture facility. We believe that other KLH suppliers do not have this capability and thus are reliant on scarce, wild populations of limpets.
 
The aquaculture cycle to raise Giant Keyhole Limpets from fertilized eggs to maturity for KLH production is approximately five years, with multiple complex larval and juvenile stages. The hemolymph circulatory fluid, which contains KLH, is extracted in a non-lethal manner utilizing our patented methods. Once extracted, the hemolymph is processed and purified through our proprietary methods, which are protected as trade secrets. KLH can be extracted from mature limpets multiple times per year.
 
We currently maintain a production inventory of limpets sufficient for an annual capacity of up to 1,500 grams/year of KLH pharmaceutical intermediate, which can be further processed and purified to produce various final product grades and formulations. We believe we can continue to scale up capacity to meet anticipated customer demand in the near term. Given sufficient funding to continue scale- up, our projected production capacity is up to 20,000 grams (20 kg) of KLH pharmaceutical intermediate in five to seven years. We plan to incrementally increase hatchery production of limpets and expand aquaculture infrastructure, which will thereby increase our KLH production capacity, in order to meet the anticipated future multi-kilogram KLH requirements of immunotherapy commercialization.
 
In December 2016, we initiated plans to optimize our protein manufacturing processes at our primary facility in Port Hueneme, California, including the evaluation and use of new equipment. This initiative is intended to increase the scalability and throughput capacity of existing manufacturing systems, which were originally developed to provide clinical development stage quantities of our Stellar KLH products.
 
We rely on contract manufacturing organizations and contract testing organizations for certain steps of cGMP processing and quality control testing. The services performed by these contract vendors have included sterile fill/finish and product release testing.
 
As a result of these operational capabilities, we believe we will be able to supply GMP grade KLH in commercial quantities to meet the anticipated long-term demand within the pharmaceutical industry, while protecting the natural source species. We base these beliefs on our intellectual property, achievements in aquaculture science, KLH production capacity, KLH sustainable manufacturing know-how, and survey data used to estimate populations of Giant Keyhole Limpets in the wild.
 
Our Aquaculture and KLH Production Facilities
 
We maintain research and manufacturing facilities directly along the Pacific Ocean with dedicated, land-based aquaculture operations in Port Hueneme, California. We have approximately 37,000 square feet of leased aquaculture, manufacturing and laboratory space. We believe our waterfront location is a proprietary asset that allows our marine scientists to work in close proximity to naturally resident Giant Keyhole Limpet colonies, and to be at the forefront in developing protective measures and environmentally sound practices for KLH production. At this location, our seawater supply and discharge system is fully permitted, which we believe is a competitive strength due in part to the time required and uncertainties related to obtaining new water discharge permits in the State of California.


Our aquaculture operations include, among other specialized infrastructure, systems for spawning, larval development, and maturation of limpets, recirculating seawater supply systems and environmental controls. Our facility currently includes multiple production tanks and numerous individual limpet production modules in two independent aquaculture production systems. Each closed recirculating system is equipped with temperature controlled seawater distribution, filtration and treatment equipment. The facility also contains a fabrication shop for production of equipment and culture apparatus.
 
Additional Aquaculture and KLH Production Locations
 
In January 2017, we established a wholly owned Mexican subsidiary under the name BioEstelar, S.A. de C.V. to support our plan to establish additional aquaculture capabilities in Baja California, including the development of regional marine resources, aquaculture and raw material processing for Stellar’s KLH products. Since 2015, we have leased undeveloped land in Baja California as part of multi-year site suitability studies. We have a related, exclusive collaboration agreement with the lessor to collaborate on the design, expansion and development of marine aquaculture resources for hatchery and maturation of Giant Keyhole Limpets on the leased property. The collaboration agreement expires in June 2018, unless terminated earlier. We believe this expansion in Mexico will support our goal to meet the anticipated long-term industry demand for KLH protein.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development is focused primarily on the aquaculture of the Giant Keyhole Limpet; improvements in KLH protein characterization and manufacturing; the development of functional assays; and new uses for KLH in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostic applications. These activities involve both internal programs and external collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies or research organizations.
 
Our internal research has included, among other activities, improvement of methods for the culture and growth of Giant Keyhole Limpet, developing proprietary formulated limpet diets, innovations in aquaculture systems and infrastructure, biophysical and biochemical characterization of the KLH molecule, analytical processes to enhance performance of our products, KLH manufacturing process improvements, and new KLH formulations and KLH-related technologies.
 
Our external collaborations have historically involved both development and evaluation projects, with multiple biopharmaceutical companies and research institutions, for the use of Stellar KLH in their programs. We believe that these collaborations provide for strategic, revenue and clinical opportunities for our future business by extending the commercial use of Stellar KLH and furthering our understanding of the KLH molecule.
 
For the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our research and development expense were $1.97 million, $1.73 million and $1.03 million, respectively. These amounts related mainly to research and development in aquaculture, improvements in analytical, manufacturing, and purification processes, stability studies and formulation development.
 
Our Stellar KLH Products
 
We offer Stellar KLH protein in various grades, formulations, custom configurations and fill finishes for both drug development and research applications. Our portfolio includes GMP and research grade products intended for: conjugation as a carrier molecule in therapeutic vaccines; assessing immune function; and, in immunotoxicology studies, for monitoring the immunomodulatory effects of drug candidates. We also offer KLH-based in vitro diagnostic kits for research and preclinical use.
 
We currently have limited revenue from sales of our Stellar KLH products. The list price for bulk Stellar KLH protein ranges from approximately $15,000 to $50,000 per gram, depending on the purity, grade, preparation, packaging configuration and volume ordered. While our customer base has not changed significantly from year to year, product sales volumes have been highly dependent and subject to variability associated with the rate of development and progression of clinical studies of third-party immunotherapies and other technologies that utilize our products. The rate of progression towards later stage studies is expected to continue to affect the timing and volume of future product sales. The advancement and commercial success of third-party products utilizing Stellar KLH is dependent upon many factors, including available capital, trial recruitment and progress, and regulatory review.

Supply Agreements, Collaboration Agreements and Contracts
 
We have entered into, and intend to continue to enter into, agreements with third parties that will allow us to supply Stellar KLH in exchange for fees, revenues or royalties. Supply agreements generally involve a customer’s commitment to purchase our Stellar KLH for use as a carrier molecule in the customer’s own immunotherapy products or as a finished product in their development programs. In return, we license and provide exclusive or priority supply in a given field and territory, and provide technical and regulatory support. When applicable, we also agree to maintain a master file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the KLH product. Our current supply agreements are limited to clinical trials and typically have an initial multi-year term, which may be renewed by customers for additional one-year periods. Our supply agreements also typically provide us with first negotiation rights for the supply of KLH in connection with potential future commercialization of a customer’s products.
 
To date, our Stellar KLH protein has been used in research and development, preclinical and clinical phases of development but has not yet been used in any commercialized and marketed drug products. Quantities required for clinical trials depend on, among other variables, the nature of the trial, the clinical indication, the number of patients enrolled, dosing regimens and vaccine manufacturing processes.

We have supply agreements with Araclon Biotech SL, a privately-held biotechnology company headquartered in Spain and majority-owned by global healthcare company Grifols, who is developing beta amyloid-targeting active immunotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases with a primary focus on Alzheimer's disease; Amaran Biotechnology, Inc., a biopharmaceuticals manufacturer based in Taiwan that manufactures a KLH conjugate vaccine for OBI Pharma, Inc., a publicly-listed Taiwan biotech company; and French biotechnology company Neovacs S.A, for the use of Stellar KLH in the development and manufacture of Neovacs’ active immunotherapies. As previously disclosed, our agreement with Neovacs provides for Neovacs to purchase Stellar KLH for use in its proprietary KLH-based Kinoid immunotherapies in the European Union, Latin America, Asia, the U.S. and Canada. Our customers manage and fund all product development and regulatory submissions for their respective drug products that utilize Stellar KLH.
 
Neostell Joint Venture Agreement
 
In May 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Neovacs S.A., a publicly-held biotechnology company in Paris, France for the formation of a joint venture company to manufacture and sell conjugated therapeutic vaccines. In July 2016, Neostell S.A.S., a French simplified stock corporation (Neostell), was formed to carry out the business of the joint venture. Neostell is expected to produce Neovacs’ Kinoid immunotherapy product candidates which utilize Stellar KLH as a carrier molecule. Neostell may also manufacture and sell other KLH-based immunotherapy products for third-party customers worldwide.
 
We hold a 30% equity interest in the joint venture in exchange for an initial capital contribution of €120,000. One-half of the initial contribution, approximately $67,000, was paid in June 2016 with the balance due upon the occurrence of certain defined future events. We will also provide additional financing to Neostell, as may be required, on a pro rata basis in line with our equity interest. If Neostell does not achieve certain milestones by December 31, 2017, it will be dissolved, unless the parties mutually agree to pursue the joint venture arrangement, or either party decides to purchase the equity interests of the other party. As of the date of this Annual Report, these milestones have not been achieved, and the parties have discussed their mutual desire to extend the deadline. Each of the parties is entitled, upon the occurrence of certain defined events, to acquire the interest of the other party. Except as otherwise described herein, the joint venture has an initial ten-year term, renewable for successive five-year terms. If either party provides notice at least six months prior to the expiration date of an applicable term that it does not wish to continue its participation in the joint venture, the other party will have a right to acquire all of such terminating party’s equity interests in Neostell.
 
In connection with the formation of Neostell and the execution of its strategy, the parties intend over time to enter into an exclusive supply agreement within a limited field of use for Stellar to supply KLH to Neostell, a supply agreement designating Neostell as the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of the Neovacs’ vaccines, and services agreements for the provision of various knowledge and expertise by each of the parties. Neovacs will also license certain of its intellectual property to Neostell.

In addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
Competition
 
The immunotherapy industry is rapidly evolving and new competitors with competing technologies and products are regularly entering clinical development and the market. We compete on the basis of: the advantages and disadvantages of Stellar KLH as compared to other KLH proteins manufactured by our competitors; our ability to educate the industry about the high quality, and sustainable and traceable features, of Stellar KLH; our ability to supply scalable quantities of GMP grade KLH; product efficacy; customer service; and the price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness of Stellar KLH as compared to our competitors. We believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors. However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We compete directly with Biosyn Corporation, a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company which manufactures KLH starting material and offers clinical and research grade KLH products. We also compete directly with SAFC, a division of Sigma-Aldrich, which offers clinical and research grade KLH products. In addition to competition from current suppliers of KLH, we also face indirect competition from developers of other carrier proteins, adjuvants or therapeutic vaccine platforms. We are unable to predict what effect evolution of the KLH and immunotherapy industries and potential new entrants may have on price, selling strategies, intellectual property or our competitive position.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations, including our aquaculture and harvesting activities, as well as production operations, manufacturing site development, and drug research, development and sales, are subject to complex regulation at the local, state and federal levels in the United States by a number of regulatory agencies including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, the Regional Water Quality Control Board Los Angeles Region, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the California Coastal Commission, the California Air Pollution Control Board, the County of Ventura, and the City of Port Hueneme.
 
We are subject to laws and regulations covering clean water and waste discharge, and are required to hold licenses for the aquaculture production and wild harvesting of the Giant Keyhole Limpet. Our aquaculture facility is subject to regulation by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region. These agencies impose regulations that restrict any activity that could pose a potential risk to the California marine environment including, but not limited to, seawater waste discharge limitations specified in our National Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permit. We regularly monitor our KLH production and manufacturing processes for compliance with applicable regulations.
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations related to research, manufacturing, and the commercial sale and distribution of our products, to the extent we choose to manufacture, sell or distribute any products outside of the United States. The requirements governing our activities in jurisdictions outside the United States vary greatly from country to country.
 
In Mexico, our current research and development activities and collaborations, and potential future operations, are subject to regulation, permitting and oversight by the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA), including the National Service of Health, Food Safety and Quality (SENASICA), the National Commission of Fisheries and Aquaculture (CONAPESCA), and the National Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture (INAPESCA), all of which are administrative bodies of SAGARPA. We are also subject to regulation, permitting and oversight by the Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the Secretariat of Health’s Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS), and by and other state and local agencies.

Good Manufacturing Practices
 
The FDA and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of our products must comply with applicable regulations governing the production of pharmaceutical products known as Current Good Manufacturing Practices. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. We are responsible for regularly assessing compliance with GMP requirements through record reviews and periodic audits and for ensuring that we take corrective action for any identified deficiencies.
 
The FDA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may issue warning or similar letters or may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions against us. To date, we have not been subject to inspection by the FDA or other drug regulatory agency because none of our customers or partners has filed an application in any country for marketing approval of a product encompassing our Stellar KLH protein.
 
New Drug Development 
 
None of our KLH products have been subject to approval as a drug by any regulatory authority. However, a number of our customers and strategic partners are utilizing Stellar KLH in the development of pharmaceuticals and immunotherapies that are subject to the regulatory approval process in various jurisdictions. The regulatory approval process for new drugs under development by our customers is typically long and expensive. Clinical trials that they conduct may not be successful and such products may not receive regulatory approval. Delays by our customers in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, regulatory approvals for their products which use Stellar KLH will have a direct effect on the demand for our products.
Employees
 
As of November 30, 2017, we had 28 employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement.
Corporate Information
 
We operate through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc., a California corporation which was organized September 9, 1999. We acquired the subsidiary on April 12, 2010 through a reverse merger and began trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) under the symbol “KLH” on April 19, 2010. We were originally incorporated in Canada on June 12, 2007 under the name China Growth Capital, Inc. and subsequently changed our name to CAG Capital, Inc. on April 15, 2008. We began trading on the TSX Venture Exchange as a Canadian capital pool company on August 29, 2008, and became a British Columbia corporation on November 25, 2009. Our reverse merger in April 2010 constituted our “qualifying transaction” under Canadian law, at which time we changed our name to Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. In January 2013, we began trading on the U.S. OTCQB Marketplace Exchange under the symbol “SBOTF” and, on November 5, 2015, our common shares began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) under the symbol “SBOT.” On March 29, 2016, at our request, our common shares were voluntarily delisted from the TSX-V in Canada and ceased trading on the TSX-V as of the close of business on April 8, 2016.
